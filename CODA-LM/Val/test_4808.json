These parked vehicles are significant as they determine the available width of the road and suggest areas where extra caution is necessary. This is particularly important if a vehicle is sticking out into the driving lane or there's a risk of a door opening into the path of the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small dog crossing the road directly in front of the ego vehicle. This poses an immediate hazard, necessitating the autonomous vehicle to decelerate or come to a complete stop to avoid an accident with the animal.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving conditions for the ego vehicle."

As always, check mirrors and blind spots regularly especially in residential areas where children, pets, and other unforeseen hazards may emerge suddenly."
