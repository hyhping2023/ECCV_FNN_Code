This vehicle occupies the adjacent lane, potentially influencing lane change decisions.\n   - A large orange crane mounted on a truck is located on the right side of a divided roadway, facing the opposite direction. Its size and position partially obstruct the view of oncoming traffic and could represent a potential hazard if it moves.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A motorcyclist is situated in the center of the image, moving in the same direction as the ego car. This motorcyclist is directly in front of the ego car, affecting following distance and potential overtaking maneuvers.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - Metal barriers line the median between opposing lanes of traffic. These barriers indicate that overtaking should not be attempted across the median, as they separate the directions of traffic.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - The shadow of the traffic light structure is visible on the roadway. Although the traffic lights themselves are not seen, their presence could affect driving behavior based on the signals they might emit.\n\nThe other categories (traffic signs, traffic lights, and traffic cones) do not contain any road users in this specific traffic image."

This type of vehicle is commonly used for construction activities requiring heavy lifting. Given its size and the nature of its operation, it may influence traffic flow by moving slowly and possibly obstructing driving lanes if it's in operation or preparing to operate. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from this vehicle.",

Since there are no traffic signs or signals visible, continue to follow standard road rules and maintain vigilance for any other road users or changes in the road conditions."
