This presence is critical as the car may alter its course or have the right-of-way, necessitating potential adjustments in the autonomous vehicle's driving strategy.\n\nOn the left, by the entrance gate, there's a security pavilion with personnel present. They are not directly on the road, but their proximity to it suggests a possibility they might enter the traffic area, influencing the flow either by stepping onto the roadway or through other interactions.\n\nThe area features barriers on both sides of the gate, delineating a distinct exit path from a parking zone. These barriers are indispensable for directing traffic flow and demarcating the regions that vehicles should avoid, clearly signaling to autonomous vehicles the boundaries to maintain.\n\nMoreover, a barrier gate is engaged and lowered right ahead near the security booth, signalling that the path forward is currently blocked. In response to this, the autonomous vehicle must be prepared to come to a halt or execute a necessary turn.\n\nAdjacent to the left of the entrance, there's a security booth with an individual seated inside. While the person inside doesn't interact directly with the road, it is imperative for the autonomous vehicle to remain alert to any potential signals or instructions that the booth's occupant might convey.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones that could affect the movement of the autonomous vehicle."

The \"No Parking\" signs and obstacles do not require immediate action, but attention should be maintained to keep correct lane discipline. If the barrier gate is moving, the vehicle should stop in front of the barrier gate; if already stopped, the vehicle should not proceed due to the no entry sign and closed barrier gate. Depending on the situation outside of the camera's view (such as traffic control signals or security instructions), it might be necessary to decide whether to turn around or wait for the gate to open.",
