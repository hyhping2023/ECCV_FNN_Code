This van is causing an obstruction in the ego car's lane and could lead to changes in traffic flow that must be anticipated by the autonomous driving system. Additionally, a dark-colored van is parked on the right side of the road, slightly extending into the driving lane. It presents a potential hazard due to the reduced lane width and the risk of someone emerging from behind it, so passing vehicles must exercise caution and possibly reduce speed.\n\nPeople are present around the checkpoint area, including one individual in dark clothing on the edge of the opposite lane, who might step onto the roadway. Their proximity to the road can lead to unpredictable movements, requiring the ego car to remain alert and prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nA line of orange traffic cones creates a pathway that veers to the left, suggesting a temporary adjustment to the traffic flow. The ego car must navigate this change by slowing down and moving cautiously. A checkered roadblock is also positioned on the right side of the road, contributing to the redirection of traffic flow and indicating that vehicles should follow the new path marked by the cones.\n\nOther objects in the scene include a red flag mounted on a pole on the right side and a red banner strung between trees on the left. These items signify the presence of the checkpoint, highlighting the need for drivers to be attentive and to follow any given directions."
