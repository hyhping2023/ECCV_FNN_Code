        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, we have a few notable road users and conditions to be mindful of. The road ahead is lined with several cars parked on both sides, which consequently reduces the available width of the road and may possibly obstruct our line of sight for oncoming traffic and other road users. Because of this, it's essential to drive with caution.\n\nAdditionally, there's a person ahead driving an electric tricycle in our lane and moving forward. The tricycle's slower speed and potential for sudden movements will likely necessitate a reduction in our speed and possibly a lane change to safely navigate around this vulnerable road user.\n\nLastly, a small dog has been spotted on the road ahead. Given that animals can be unpredictable and may move abruptly, it's important for us to drive carefully and remain prepared to come to a complete stop if necessary to ensure safety.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this traffic image, nor any other objects besides the small dog. Therefore, we should focus our attention primarily on the parked vehicles and the vulnerable road users like the electric tricycle driver and the dog for safe transit through the area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Self-driving vehicles should proceed with caution, decelerating due to the presence of small animals on the road. Maintain a safe distance from all parked vehicles and moving tricycles, and if the animals do not move away, be prepared to stop and ready to respond to any other unexpected actions from road users. If possible, slightly move towards the center or left side of the lane to create a safety buffer and watch out for oncoming traffic. Continuously monitoring the road conditions is crucial, including the positions of animals, ready to avoid small objects on the road while maintaining safe control of the vehicle.",

It is often considered a companion animal and is commonly referred to as a dog. Given its location on the road, the presence of the animal poses a hazard to safe driving. The driver of the ego car should reduce speed and prepare to stop if necessary to avoid endangering the animal and to prevent a potential accident.",
