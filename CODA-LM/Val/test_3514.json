Additionally, a pedestrian walking a dog is moving along the right side and coming close to the vehicle's route. This poses a potential danger as pedestrians may suddenly change direction or enter the vehicle's path.\n\nMoreover, a tall green construction fence runs parallel to the road on the right, blocking the view of the pedestrian path or the construction site. This fence can obscure potential hazards or pedestrians stepping onto the road, requiring the driver to be cautious.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there is a blue tent and various temporary stalls. These stalls and the people who visit them might suddenly rush into the road, presenting further potential dangers."
