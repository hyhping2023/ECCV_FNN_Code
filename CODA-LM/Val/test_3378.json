The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance behind the truck and be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, a blue and white rectangular traffic sign indicating a road closure or restriction is placed on the left foreground of the image. This sign alerts the ego car to upcoming construction or a road closure, necessitating the preparation for an alternative route or adherence to detour signs. The ego car should be ready for potential construction activity ahead and avoid stopping or parking in the area.\n\nMultiple orange traffic cones are arranged in an arrow-like formation pointing towards the right in the middle of the road, indicating a lane narrowing or diversion. The ego car is advised to merge right to bypass a road construction or maintenance area, reduce speed, and be alert for changes in traffic patterns due to the narrowed road.\n\nMetal barriers are present, blocking the entire width of the road in the middle ground, reinforcing the road closure. These barriers serve as a physical obstruction that indicates where road work is taking place and where vehicles are prohibited from passing. The ego car will need to stop or turn before reaching the barrier, decrease speed, and exercise increased caution due to the potential presence of workers on the road or a closed road section."

The presence of the truck ahead also requires attention as it may slow down or stop due to the road conditions, which would require the ego car to keep a safe following distance. Ultimately, since the road ahead is closed as indicated by the barriers, the ego car should be prepared to stop or turn as directed by road signs or construction crew instructions. Proceed with caution, maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, and prepare for potential changes in traffic flow due to roadwork. Reduce speed to account for the reduced lane width and uneven road surface. Do not attempt to pass the truck until the roadwork area is cleared and it is safe to do so."
