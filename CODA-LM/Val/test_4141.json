Although this vehicle is not moving, the ego car needs to maintain adequate clearance when passing by to avoid any potential issues.\n\nSecondly, there's another blue and white car also parked on the right, facing towards the ego car. As this vehicle's actions are uncertain—whether it's parked or idling—there is a possibility it could start moving, or force the ego car to alter its trajectory due to oncoming traffic.\n\nThird, there is a blue and white car parallel parked on the left side of the ego car. While it is stationary and won't require immediate action from the ego car, its presence suggests potential road activity that could affect traffic flow, such as pedestrians around the vehicle or car doors that may open unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, on the roadside to the right, there are large industrial spools and a stack of tires. These objects, while not on the driving path, should be noted but will not affect the driving behavior if the vehicle remains in its lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this scene that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

There appear to be no immediate hazards, so proceeding with standard caution is advised. Maintain a slow and cautious speed while passing the parked or stationary blue and white car to the right, in case it starts moving. Keep a safe distance from the roadside objects and continue to observe the road ahead for any unexpected hazards. The ego car should maintain a safe speed and keep to its lane while passing the parked vehicles, watching for any indications of movement from these cars or doors opening. There is no immediate action required, but the ego car should stay vigilant for unexpected events, such as pedestrians crossing between parked cars or vehicles pulling out without indication."
