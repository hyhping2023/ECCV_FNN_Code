        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles identified on the right side of the road. The first is a white car parked in a manner that aligns with the direction of the ego vehicle. Although the white car is stationary and does not directly impede the path of the ego vehicle, it represents a potential hazard that requires cautious driving. The reason for caution is that there might be occupants in the parked car who could unexpectedly open the car doors or move around in close proximity to the ego vehicle's path.\n\nA few spaces ahead of the white car, there is a red car parked in a similar fashion on the right side of the road. The red car, like the white one, is stationary and does not necessitate any immediate evasive maneuvers. However, its presence suggests that the area may be fairly populated, requiring the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant for pedestrians or for the potential opening of car doors.\n\nThere are no other road users or objects present in the scene according to the data provided, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects."

Use headlights if not already on, and consider using fog lights if equipped and the conditions warrant their use."
