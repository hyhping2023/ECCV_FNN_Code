This could be due to waiting at a traffic light or due to traffic congestion. The position of the sedan directly influences the ego car's ability to move forward.\n    - A green city bus is stopped on the side of the road to the left-hand side, suggesting it may be at a bus stop picking up or dropping off passengers. This bus could affect lateral movement and create potential hazards if it pulls into traffic or if pedestrians move between the bus and the ego car.\n    - A yellow construction machinery (excavator) is present on the right side beyond the bus, positioned parallel to the road. Its presence indicates construction work which may affect lane availability and traffic flow.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n    - A red traffic light is visible ahead at the intersection. This indicates that the ego car must stop and wait for the green signal before proceeding through the intersection.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n    - Traffic cones are lined up along the edge of the right lane, indicating active lane closure or roadwork. These require vehicles to merge left if needed and proceed with caution.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n    - There are yellow and black temporary barriers to the far right which form part of the delineation for the construction zone. These barriers indicate that part of the road is closed for construction and ensure traffic stays clear of the worksite."
