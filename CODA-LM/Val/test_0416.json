    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck ahead. If it begins to merge into your lane, be prepared to slow down or change lanes. Monitor the movements of vehicles in the left lane to anticipate changes in traffic flow and potential slowdowns. Stay alert for any other road signs or signals that might appear, as these could provide additional directions or require a change in driving behavior. Additionally, your vehicle should slow down for upcoming curves and bridges as indicated by road signs and remain vigilant for unseen traffic lights, responding as soon as they appear. Also, maintain a safe distance from the sedan in front of you. If the concrete mixer restricts space or its operations result in debris or obstacles on the road, be ready to change lanes to the left. Using turn signals and checking blind spots before changing lanes are critical for safety. Meanwhile, maintain a steady speed and monitor road signs for route information, without the need for immediate adjustments.",

The presence of such a vehicle indicates potential nearby construction activity. When encountered on the road, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for possible slow movement or sudden stops. Additionally, there may be construction-related signage or changes in traffic patterns ahead, therefore, the driver should be vigilant and ready to adapt to these potential changes.",
