It appears to be moving forward or possibly crossing an intersection. Due to its size and proximity, this truck significantly influences the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle, particularly as it occupies the adjacent lane. This positioning could obstruct the line of sight or necessitate a lane change.\n\nAbove the intersection, there are directional signs indicating through lanes or turning lanes. These signs provide lane selection guidance for the vehicle based on the desired direction of travel.\n\nDirectly ahead, the traffic light displays a red light on the left side, indicating that the signals for each lane correspond to specific driving maneuvers. The main vehicle should stop if it is in the left-turn lane due to the red light. However, if it is in a lane with a corresponding green right-turn signal, it can proceed, but must adhere to the right-of-way and ensure the lane matches the intended action.\n\nOn the right side of the car, orange and white traffic cones mark a designated area on the road. These cone-shaped markers likely indicate road construction or obstacles along the side. Although they do not affect the current driving path of the vehicle, they still require attention."

Should you be in a lane designated for going straight or turning right, you may proceed with caution while also being mindful of the presence of large trucks and respecting their right of way. Additionally, your vehicle should be prepared to merge and depart from areas marked by traffic cones, adjusting your position to maintain a safe distance from potential road construction hazards.",

            "description and explanation": "A heavy-duty construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck, is visible. Its key features include a large revolving drum used for mixing concrete components. This vehicle is essential in construction sites for delivering mixed concrete to the required location efficiently. Due to its size and purpose, it often travels at slower speeds and may make frequent stops or turns, especially near construction sites. As such, the ego car should maintain an appropriate following distance, exercise caution, and be prepared for unexpected maneuvers from the mixer truck.",

Bollards serve multiple purposes including guiding traffic, creating barriers to vehicle entry, protecting pedestrians and infrastructure, and sometimes for aesthetic enhancements. Since bollards are fixed objects, the ego car must ensure a safe distance is kept to avoid collisions. Moreover, if bollards mark the boundary of the drivable road space or indicate changes in traffic patterns, the driver should stay alert and adjust the vehicle's position on the road accordingly.",
