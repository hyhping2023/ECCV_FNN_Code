The ego car should monitor this vehicle for any sudden movements as it could potentially enter its path or affect its maneuvering space.\n\nA pedestrian is also present, walking away from the ego car towards the left side of the image, in close proximity to parked vehicles. The ego car must ensure the pedestrian’s safety by maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to stop if the pedestrian unexpectedly changes direction or enters the carriageway.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, there are traffic cones arranged in a line indicating a boundary or a closed lane, which limits the available driving space. The ego car must not cross the cones and should navigate around them if possible or wait if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there is a temporary barrier resembling a mobile gate or checkpoint directly in front of the ego vehicle, blocking its forward path. This barrier indicates that the area ahead may be restricted or closed to vehicle traffic.\n\nLastly, a cart-like object is observed towards the left near the pedestrian. This object could pose an additional obstacle or may be related to the pedestrian's activity. The ego car should be cautious as it may influence the pedestrian’s movements or become an obstacle if left on or near the carriageway.\n\nThese elements collectively suggest that the ego car should proceed with heightened caution, ensuring the safety of both the pedestrian and itself while navigating the restricted driving space."
