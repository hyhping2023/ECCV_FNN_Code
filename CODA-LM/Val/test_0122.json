        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, multiple road users and objects are present that affect driving behavior. In the left lane, there is a white van positioned diagonally in front of our car to the left, which appears to be either moving forward or waiting to proceed. This vehicle may suddenly accelerate or decelerate, impacting our lane change or speed adjustments. Additionally, in the right lane, a dark-colored van located to the front-right of our vehicle appears to be in motion, which may influence our lane change choices and affect the traffic flow speed. Ahead in the same lane, a silver van is moving in the same direction as our vehicle, setting the speed for its lane and affecting decisions when it brakes or changes lanes. There are also several vehicles in the opposite lane, which while crucial for situational awareness, do not directly influence our immediate decisions unless an abnormal action occurs.\n\nVulnerable road users include a group of people on the far right sidewalk, who do not directly affect the current driving situation but require monitoring in case someone suddenly walks into the road. A motorcyclist on the right edge of the image is moving away from this lane, and although they are not moving towards our vehicle, their movements should be monitored as any decision to change direction or lanes could impact the current situation.\n\nA blue directional sign is suspended above the intersection, indicating the upcoming road name and direction, though it does not directly affect immediate driving decisions. The traffic light shows a green light for the through lanes and a red left arrow for the left-turn-only lane, allowing vehicles to go straight while requiring left-turning vehicles to stop, directly influencing our carâ€™s movement.\n\nTraffic cones have been placed along the right edge of the road, indicating potential road construction ahead or a lane closure, requiring the vehicle to possibly merge left or adjust its path. Additional traffic cones in the left-turn lane indicate that this lane is currently not in use, thus it should not be utilized for turning. There are no barriers or other objects present in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Pay attention to any lane-changing maneuvers by the van on your right to prevent affecting your own vehicle's path. Due to the traffic cones placed on the right side, be prepared for possible merging actions. Continue to observe the behavior of road users and follow directional signs and traffic lights to ensure safe navigation. Your vehicle should keep a safe distance from the white van ahead and monitor the speed changes or lane changes of the white SUV. Attention should also be paid to motorcyclists to ensure they do not enter your vehicle's path. Be mindful of the traffic cones and prepare to adjust your driving trajectory to deal with upcoming roadworks or lane closures indicated by the cones. Regularly checking your mirrors and blind spots is crucial for understanding the actions of all road users mentioned above and any possible changes in the traffic environment. Your vehicle should proceed straight, monitor the lane-changing actions of the white SUV on your left, and maintain a safe distance from the motorcyclist ahead in the right lane. The traffic cones indicate that turning left is currently not possible, so if intending to turn left, you should plan an alternative route. When the green light allows, you should also be ready to brake at any moment if the traffic conditions ahead change or if the signal light is about to turn yellow.",
