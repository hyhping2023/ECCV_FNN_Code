It is marked with the number 628 and has a rotating drum on the back. The truck's size and position might restrict the space available for the ego car and could be dangerous if it makes sudden lateral movements. This vehicle affects the ego car's speed and following distance due to its larger size and potentially different acceleration and stopping distances.\n   - **Several cars**: Multiple cars are stopped ahead in the ego car's lane and adjacent lanes, including a white SUV directly in the neighboring lane. These cars are halted due to a traffic signal ahead, impacting the ego car's ability to maneuver or change lanes. The positions of these vehicles influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes and speed adjustments.\n\n2. **Traffic lights**:\n   - **Red traffic light**: There is a traffic light ahead displaying a red signal. This requires all vehicles, including the ego car, to stop until the signal changes. The ego car must remain stationary until the light turns green."

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy-duty construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck designed to transport and mix concrete for construction projects. Its large rotating drum is used to maintain the mixed concrete in a liquid state. The vehicle's size and function mean it moves slower than typical road vehicles and requires a wider turning radius. Here, it occupies a significant part of the road lane, which will necessitate maintaining a safe following distance and being cautious if overtaking. The ego car should anticipate potential stops or slow movement ahead due to the vehicle's operational needs at construction sites.",

Be alert to the traffic situation, which may evolve due to congestion. Stay stationary as the traffic light is red, and prepare to proceed when it turns green, while watching for signals from other road users that could affect the ego car's path. The ego car should remain in its current lane, maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck ahead, and prepare to stop if the traffic situation requires it. Since the light is currently red, the ego car should come to a complete stop at the designated stopping point and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding. The driver should also be aware of the vehicles in the adjacent lanes, in case any other road users attempt to merge into the ego lane from the sides."
