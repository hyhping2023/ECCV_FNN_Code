While the van, being stationary, doesn't directly impact the dynamic road conditions, its unconventional parking position suggests it might soon engage in maneuvering, such as pulling out or adjusting its position.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are visible in the scene. This lack of vulnerable road users means that the ego vehicle doesnâ€™t need to make immediate adjustments for pedestrian crossings or for bicycles and motorcycles merging into traffic.\n\nAssorted items, which could be debris or goods for sale, are situated on the side of the road near the parked vehicles. These stationary objects could pose a potential hazard if they were to enter the road unexpectedly, so the ego vehicle should maintain a cautious speed and be prepared to react promptly."

The ego car should also continue to scan for any traffic signs or signals that may be obscured by the environment."
