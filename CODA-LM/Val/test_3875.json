Due to its size and heavy-load nature, it might have slower acceleration and deceleration times, which could significantly affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. A safe following distance is required to accommodate the truck's slower operational characteristics and the potential for sudden stops or slow acceleration.\n\nAdjacent to the ego car, several cars in the left lanes are visible, with some appearing to be turning. These cars may change lanes or affect the ego car's ability to change lanes, necessitating vigilance and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes as needed.\n\nA cyclist is also present, positioned on the far-right side of the image, proceeding along the roadway in the same direction as traffic, slightly ahead of the ego car, and within a dedicated lane or the edge of the road. The cyclist's proximity to the roadway requires monitoring, as they may enter the traffic lane or be affected by the traffic flow.\n\nTraffic lights ahead show a red signal for turning left and a green light for going straight, directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle must stop at the intersection ahead if intending to turn left and wait for a green signal. The green light allows the ego car and the vehicles ahead to proceed straight through the intersection, influencing the ego car's decision to continue at the current speed or prepare to stop if the lights change.\n\nA median with vegetation separates opposing lanes of traffic, indicating that the ego car is restricted from making any left turns or crossing over into the opposing traffic lanes.

Be cautious of the adjacent passenger cars, especially those that may be preparing to change lanes or turn. Keep an eye on the cyclist; be prepared to slow down or adjust lane position if they move unpredictably. As the traffic light ahead shows a red signal for turning left and a green light for going straight, prepare to come to a complete stop at the intersection if intending to turn left and wait for the signal to change before proceeding. Stay in the current lane and respect the median barrier's role in traffic management. Continue to observe the road conditions and traffic signals for any changes that may require a reaction from the ego car."
