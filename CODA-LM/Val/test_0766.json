There are several vehicles visible. A dark sedan is stopped ahead on the left side, with taillights visible, and the self-driving car will need to consider its presence by adjusting speed and lane positioning. Multiple vehicles' taillights ahead indicate a stream of traffic, necessitating maintaining a safe following distance. Additionally, another dark-colored car is at the intersection, facing the ego car with headlights on, which requires anticipation of its actions.\n\nVulnerable road users are also present, with a group of pedestrians waiting to cross the road on the right side, accompanied by a scooter, for which the autonomous vehicle should be ready to yield. A scooter with two helmeted individuals is positioned in front of the vehicle, necessitating a safe stopping distance and driving cautiously. A cyclist is also spotted in a bike lane, necessitating careful monitoring of their behavior.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, one sign displays a location name and is above a traffic light, helping with lane directions but not affecting immediate driving behavior. Another road name sign is on the right side of the road, providing information but requiring no direct response from the driver.\n\nIn traffic light analysis, there is a pedestrian signal displaying a red standing figure, meaning pedestrians should not be crossing, and the self-driving car should remain watchful. A traffic light showing red directly ahead calls for the autonomous vehicle to stop and wait for the green signal before proceeding.\n\nThe data does not include any traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, suggesting these elements do not impact the driving scene observed in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should drive cautiously, maintain a safe distance from the electric scooters ahead, and be prepared to stop or yield to pedestrians when the pedestrian signal changes. At the same time, monitor the vehicles in front and adjust speed accordingly to keep the traffic flowing smoothly. Additionally, scanning for any pedestrians or other road users who may disregard traffic signals is an important safety measure. The vehicle should come to a complete stop at red lights, keeping a safe distance from the sedan in front. Watch for cyclists on the right, in case they decide to leave the bike lane, which could lead to potential conflicts, and be ready for pedestrians who may cross as soon as the pedestrian light turns green.",
