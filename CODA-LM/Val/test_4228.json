        "description and explanation": "The image depicts a road with various elements that affect driving behavior. \n\nThere are an orange construction vehicle, likely an excavator, parked on the left side of the road next to a building surrounded by construction fencing. This indicates that construction work may be ongoing ahead, potentially introducing obstacles or roadworks.\n\nIn addition to this, several cars are parked along a distant street. These stationary vehicles form static obstacles that the driver must navigate around, and pedestrians may appear between them unexpectedly.\n\nA cyclist is located in the middle of the road ahead, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. This cyclist affects driving behavior as maintaining a safe overtaking distance necessitates adjustments to the speed and lane position of our vehicle.\n\nBlue construction fencing surrounds the building's construction area on the left. This barrier restricts passage, reducing the available driving space and marking the boundary between the construction zone and drivable road.\n\nFinally, some construction materials are piled on the left side of the road near the construction vehicles. These materials signify ongoing work and the potential presence of workers or more materials entering the roadway, necessitating cautious driving and readiness to navigate around obstacles.\n\nCombined, these factors make for a complex driving environment requiring careful navigation to ensure safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the potential movement of cyclists and construction vehicles or parked vehicles, it is necessary to drive with caution. Maintain a safe distance from cyclists and be prepared to slow down or change lanes when necessary, while also being mindful of debris on the roadside. Regularly check your rearview mirrors to be aware of other road users who may enter the roadway. Assume that intersections with inoperative traffic lights may be treated as all-way stops, and approach with care. Continue to monitor the surrounding environment and be alert to any new road users or changes in traffic conditions that may affect driving behavior.",

It is parked on the side of the road, near a building with scaffolding, indicating that construction work is in progress. For the ego car, the presence of this vehicle suggests that there might be construction work ahead, which could result in road obstructions or detours.
