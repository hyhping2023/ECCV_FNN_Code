This truck is significant due to its size, the potential for obstructing the view ahead, and the possibility that cement or debris could fall from the mixer, posing a hazard.\n\nNext, a black passenger car is adjacent to the ego vehicle on the left side, slightly ahead in the next lane. Its position and speed relative to the ego car need to be monitored to prevent any potential lane merging conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, a motorcycle is observed ahead, positioned between lanes, indicating it may weave through traffic. This lane-splitting behavior necessitates caution from the ego vehicle, requiring readiness to adjust speed or position to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAn SUV is parked in a line of vehicles to the left, close to the curbside. Although stationary, sudden movements like doors opening can pose risks.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a cyclist is seen at the bottom right of the image, riding in the same direction as the traffic flow. The cyclist's presence is crucial for the ego car to consider, particularly when changing lanes or maintaining a safe passing distance.\n\nPedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right. While they do not directly impact the immediate driving behavior, they should be monitored in case they approach the roadway, potentially becoming a safety concern.\n\nLastly, there are trees and bushes lining the right side of the road.
