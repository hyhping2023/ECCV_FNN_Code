        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several notable road users and objects that are crucial for the autonomous navigation of the ego car. Firstly, there is a large red truck on the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car and traveling in the same direction. This truck, which is carrying multiple cars, poses a visibility concern and necessitates careful monitoring due to its size and the potential impact on safe following distances. An adjustment in speed might be required to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are several cars in front of the ego car, occupying both the center and right lanes, which indicates a moderate level of traffic flow. The positioning of these vehicles is particularly important as it influences the ego car's ability to change lanes safely and maintain an appropriate distance from the vehicles ahead.\n\nAhead of the traffic, there is a traffic light displaying a green signal for going straight and a green arrow for making left turns. This indicates that the ego car can proceed without the necessity to stop, allowing for continued movement through the intersection or a turn, based on the intended route.\n\nFurthermore, yellow and black traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, signaling ongoing roadside work or the presence of a hazard. This setup warrants cautious driving from the ego car, which might include reducing speed or maneuvering carefully to avoid the cones and any potential hazards associated with the indicated roadwork or obstacle.\n\nIn this scenario, other possible elements such as vulnerable road users, additional traffic signs, barriers, and miscellaneous objects are not present or deemed relevant. The absence of these elements simplifies the autonomous driving decisions to be made but nonetheless requires attentiveness to the described road users and traffic controls."

Generally, traffic cones are used to guide traffic to avoid certain areas on the road, for road works, potential hazards, or other disruptions. They are traditionally cone-shaped, made of bright colors like orange for high visibility, and often have a reflective sleeve for better visibility at night. The presence of this traffic cone on the side of the road indicates that drivers need to be cautious and may need to merge left or adjust their driving path to avoid the area it's marking.",

Since the traffic light is currently green, it is safe to proceed, but remain vigilant for any yellow light indicating the need to prepare to stop. Adhere to any changed speed limits or instructions suggested by the traffic cones on the right. Continue to observe the traffic conditions and positions of cars in all lanes to anticipate any changes in traffic flow or hazards that may affect lane choice and speed adjustments."
