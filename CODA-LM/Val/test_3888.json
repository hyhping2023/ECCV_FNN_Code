This parked vehicle reduces the available road width, necessitating careful navigation by the ego car to ensure safety. Additionally, there are reflective markers on the back of the construction vehicle, which serve as a warning to the ego car to proceed with caution, as they indicate the possibility of road work or an obstruction ahead. Furthermore, there are small objects scattered on the road in the ego car's lane, which could be debris. This debris presents a risk as it can potentially damage the vehicle or cause the driver to perform hazardous avoidance maneuvers."

Be vigilant for any movement from the construction site that could affect roadway safety and maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle to avoid any debris. Drive with caution due to road conditions that could reduce traction."
