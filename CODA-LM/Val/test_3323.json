A red truck ahead in the left lane, either stopped or moving slowly due to a construction site, requiring the vehicle to maintain a safe distance and be ready to stop or slow down.\n2. A white sedan driving along the nearest opposite lane, indicating that despite the construction, multiple lanes are open for traffic, and the autonomous vehicle should stay in the correct lane.\n3. A silver car in the right lane driving in the opposite direction, affecting the maneuverable space available to our vehicle and potentially indicating an imminent lane change.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is:\n- A pedestrian walking along the left edge of the lane with their back to the oncoming traffic, requiring the vehicle to slow down and prepare to stop or turn to avoid ensuring the pedestrian's safety.\n\nRegarding barriers:\n- There is a concrete barrier on the right side, which may cause the lane to narrow, necessitating a safe distance from obstacles to prevent collisions and ensure the safe passage of adjacent vehicles.\n\nThere are two other significant objects:\n1. Various obstacles scattered on the left side, including construction machinery and materials, which, although not directly affecting the road, draw attention due to potential worker movements and machinery encroaching on the roadway.\n2. Construction machinery and rubble on the left side of the road, indicating that this is a construction area, where activities may affect traffic flow and pose additional hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the construction site ahead, as well as the presence of buses, pedestrians, and traffic cones, the vehicle should slow down and increase the following distance. Stay alert, be ready to respond to changes in traffic lights or traffic patterns at any time, and prepare to stop or change lanes according to signs or directions from construction workers. Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, paying close attention to its signal lights to handle any stops or turns. If the truck begins to slow down and it is safe, prepare to change lanes. Exercise caution around pedestrians on the roadside. Continue monitoring changes in traffic lights. Allow sufficient space for obstacles on the left side and stay vigilant of the construction area to guard against sudden actions from workers or machinery. Adjust speed to ensure the safety of this vehicle and comply with any posted construction speed limits.",
