        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that the autonomous vehicle must consider:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A black car is present in the leftmost lane, driving in the opposite direction to our vehicle. The self-driving vehicle may need to consider this car's position and speed when deciding whether to change lanes or adjust its own speed.\n2. A blue truck is located a few meters away in the middle lane, also traveling in a different direction from the self-driving vehicle. The autonomous system should monitor the truck to maintain a safe following distance due to the potential for sudden stops or turns.\n3. There are several vehicles in the right lane moving in the same direction as our car. These vehicles influence the traffic flow, and the self-driving vehicle may need to adjust its speed or be ready for merging vehicles based on their behavior.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A motorcyclist is traveling in the same direction as the self-driving vehicle, positioned on the right side. The autonomous vehicle must keep a safe distance and be prepared for any sudden movements due to the motorcyclist's small size and vulnerability.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. The traffic light ahead for this lane is green, which means the self-driving vehicle is allowed to proceed. However, the vehicle should remain alert for any changes in the light or traffic conditions.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. There is a trash can on the far right side near the sidewalk. While it is not a direct threat, the self-driving vehicle should be cautious of any debris that might be on the road from this or similar objects. The object does not currently affect the driving route, but vigilance is necessary to spot any potential obstacles.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered by the autonomous vehicle."

If needed, the vehicle should be prepared to change lanes to avoid debris, while ensuring that this maneuver does not endanger nearby motorcyclists.
