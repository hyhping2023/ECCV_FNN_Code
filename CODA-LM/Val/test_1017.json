        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a white sedan situated directly in front of the ego car within the same lane. The sedan is centered and appears to be either stationary or moving slowly. The visible exhaust suggests that the vehicle's engine is running. The position and movement of this sedan are important as they control the driving speed and the distance that the ego car needs to maintain behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dog near the right edge of the road, moving from the right towards the left. It's near the ego vehicle's lane and could potentially enter it, which presents a possible risk. The presence of the dog requires the ego car to be ready to react if the animal moves into the lane unexpectedly.\n\nThe road is flanked on both sides by tall green metal barriers. These barriers reduce visibility and prevent pedestrian access, therefore limiting the ego carâ€™s ability to see ahead and restricting any potential maneuvers it might need to take, such as in response to the dog's movements.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported which affect the driving conditions for the ego car."
