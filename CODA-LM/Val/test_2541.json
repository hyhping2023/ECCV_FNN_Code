        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several key elements to note that influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, or the ego vehicle.\n\nFirstly, there are three vehicles in view. A white car is parked on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. The presence of this parked car reduces the available space on the road, necessitating the ego vehicle to maintain adequate distance to navigate safely. Furthermore, a black SUV is situated on the right in the same lane as the ego vehicle, just a bit ahead. The movement of this black SUV is crucial as it impacts the ego vehicle's predictions on traffic flow and adjustments in driving strategy. Also, a red car is noted in the opposite lane, facing the direction opposite to that of the ego vehicle. Observing this oncoming red car is essential since its actions, like potential lane changes or turns, could affect the ego vehicle’s path.\n\nThere's a pedestrian in view, dressed in red, walking alongside the road in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This pedestrian’s actions warrant careful monitoring by the ego vehicle to anticipate and react to any unexpected entry into the roadway or any attempts to cross it.\n\nAdding to the mix, there are several orange traffic cones arranged in a line, indicating a segregation of the traffic lanes in the proximity of the ego vehicle. The presence of these traffic cones signals a change in the traffic pattern or a merge, guiding the ego vehicle on how to adjust its course safely.\n\nThe scene lacks any traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects, suggesting that these elements do not influence the current driving decisions of the ego vehicle in this particular scenario."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is an orange and white conical marker used to direct traffic or indicate an area where traffic is not allowed. It is typically used to mark temporary traffic control zones, hazards in the roadway, or to detour traffic. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that the ego car may need to adjust its course to avoid the marked area. The driver should be prepared to slow down and possibly change lanes if the cones indicate a closed or restricted lane ahead.",
