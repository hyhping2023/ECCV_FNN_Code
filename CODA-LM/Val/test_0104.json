Additionally, there are red and white barriers positioned on the right side of the intersection, signaling that a portion of the sidewalk or bike lane is closed off. This could potentially lead pedestrians or cyclists to merge into the vehicle's path, necessitating extra vigilance from the driver. Furthermore, there is a pedestrian crossing clearly marked on the road just ahead of the ego vehicle, which implies that pedestrians might be nearby and the vehicle should be ready to give way to them if necessary. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or any other objects reported in the scene."
