        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under observation, there are two notable categories of road users or elements that stand out. Firstly, there's a traffic sign indicating two crucial pieces of information for drivers. The description of this sign is as follows: it signals that there's construction work ahead on the right side of the road and is followed by another sign indicating that a detour is required to the left. The explanation provided for these signs is quite straightforward; they inform drivers about the ongoing construction activities and the necessity to alter their usual travel paths to accommodate the changes, suggesting a detour.\n\nAdditionally, the image features temporary construction barriers, which are particularly significant. The description of these barriers highlights their placement on the right side of the road, equipped with warning signs to draw attention. The explanation for these barriers is that they serve as a physical indication of road sections being temporarily closed for construction. Consequently, such barriers necessitate actions from the drivers, such as merging to the left side of the road or reducing their speed to ensure safety and compliance with the altered road conditions.\n\nThese elements – the traffic sign and the barriers – collectively contribute to the dynamic nature of the road environment in this image, demonstrating the necessity for drivers to remain vigilant and adaptable to changes in their driving behavior due to construction activities."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and be prepared to merge left if necessary due to possible lane blockages caused by construction work. Pay attention to cyclists and pedestrians that may appear because of indicated shared paths. Reduce your speed to comply with any construction speed limits and to allow safely for sudden changes in road conditions or for unexpected road users entering the lane. Prepare to detour to the left following the traffic sign directions. Stay alert for workers or unexpected obstacles that may appear at the construction site. Maintain a safe distance from obstacles and anticipate potential actions by other road users in response to the detour.",
