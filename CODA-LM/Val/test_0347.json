Its stationary or slow-moving nature is indicated by engaged brake lights. This vehicle necessitates a change in the ego car's trajectory to prevent delay or collision.\n- Further ahead of the construction vehicle in the same direction, there is a white car that the ego car needs to monitor, as its sudden actions could impact the traffic flow, especially in relation to the construction vehicle.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- A 'No Entry' sign is positioned on the right, restricting vehicles from entering the lane beyond. This sign means the ego car cannot use the right lane to pass the construction vehicle.\n- A blue circular sign with a white upward arrow commands vehicles to continue straight in the current lane, applicable to the ego car.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A red traffic light is observable further along the road, above the lane and near the 'No Entry' sign. It's indicating a requirement for all vehicles in this lane to halt until it turns green.\n\nBarriers:\n- To the left of the ego car, there's a median barrier which separates the opposing traffic directions, effectively delineating the safe driving area for the ego car and protecting it from cars in the opposite lanes.\n\nThe other categories—vulnerable road users, traffic cones, and other objects—do not contain any items, implying their absence in this particular traffic scenario."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a paver often used in roadworks. This type of vehicle plays a critical role in laying asphalt or concrete for creating road surfaces. It signifies active or recent road construction work in the area. The presence of this vehicle in the driving scenario implies there could be potential delays or diversions ahead. The ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down, adhere to any temporary traffic signals or signs, and follow directions given by construction workers or temporary road markings, ensuring the safety of the workers and the correct navigation around the construction zone.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of the construction vehicle ahead and the 'No Entry' sign prohibiting a lane change to the right, the ego car should reduce speed and prepare to stop due to the red traffic light ahead. If the construction vehicle is stationary, the ego car should wait behind it until the traffic light turns green and it is safe to proceed, or follow any instructions from road workers if present. The ego car should also be prepared for the traffic conditions that might be affected by vehicles reacting to the construction vehicle. Due to the 'No Entry' sign, the ego car should not attempt to turn right at the upcoming intersection. Instead, it should follow the lane directions provided by the round blue signs and select the appropriate lane to continue its journey. Overall, maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to adjust speed or change lanes is recommended."
