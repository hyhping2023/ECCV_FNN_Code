Given its size and the context of being stored outside near other reels, it is likely not meant for immediate use. Its presence does not directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car since it is not on the roadway nor posing an obstruction to the vehicle's path. It should be noted, however, that this kind of object stored near the road indicates industrial activity in the area, which could potentially lead to traffic due to large vehicles entering or exiting work sites.",

For the ego car, these objects do not pose an immediate threat to driving behavior as they are stationary and situated off the roadway.
