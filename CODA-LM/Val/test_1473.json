The first is a black sedan located directly in the ego car's lane, slightly to the left, with no brake lights visible, which could mean it is either stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle requires the ego car to be cautious and ready for any sudden stops or movements. The second vehicle is a silver SUV positioned to the left of the black sedan, only partially in view, and facing the same direction. It appears to be moving slowly or stopped, indicating heavy traffic and the potential for unexpected lane changes that the ego car needs to anticipate.\n\nAdditionally, there are two vulnerable road users present. One is a pedestrian near the roadside on the left, wearing a dark jacket and light pants, who may step onto the road, prompting the ego car to drive carefully. The other pedestrian is walking on the left sidewalk, parallel to the road, and although not currently on the road, the ego car should remain alert to the possibility of this individual entering the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."
