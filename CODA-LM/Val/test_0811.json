The truck is carrying a shipping container and has reflective signs on the rear for high visibility. The clear visibility of the truck's details, like the text on the container, suggests a short distance between the ego car and the truck.",
                "explanation": "The truck directly ahead affects the ego car's ability to proceed and possibly indicates traffic congestion or a stoppage ahead. The truck is a significant road user since it may limit the ego vehicle's option to safely change lanes or speed up considering the size and potential slower movement of the truck. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from the truck, be prepared for sudden stops, and should not attempt to overtake unless the adjacent lane is clear and it is safe to do so."

        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene presents a large truck directly ahead of the ego car, an important observation for understanding the current driving context. This truck is carrying a shipping container and has its red rear lights illuminated, which could indicate that it's moving very slowly or has come to a standstill. The presence of reflective signs on the truck's rear enhances its visibility to the ego car. The visibility is so clear that the text on the container is easily readable, suggesting the truck is at a short distance from the ego car.\n\nThe proximity and actions of the truck have significant implications for the ego car's driving behavior. Given that the truck is right in front of the ego car, this situation points towards potential traffic congestion or a stoppage ahead. As trucks are larger and typically move slower than smaller vehicles, this truck limits the ego car's options for safely changing lanes or accelerating. Hence, it's crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for sudden halts, and only consider overtaking if it's absolutely safe to do so and the adjacent lane is clear. This summary encapsulates the available information without any other categories to discuss, emphasizing the adjusted driving strategies needed in response to this large vehicle's presence on the road."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large commercial vehicle, often referred to as a truck. It appears to be stopped or moving slowly ahead, as indicated by its position directly in front of the ego car. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and prepare to stop if the truck stops. The driver of the ego car should also be vigilant for any turn signals or brake lights from the truck indicating a turn or decrease in speed, which would require the ego car to adjust its driving behavior accordingly.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead and be prepared to come to a complete stop if necessary. Monitor the vehicle's brake lights for indications of movement or further stopping and keep an eye out for any turn signals or other signs that the truck may be making a maneuver. If the truck begins to move, follow at a cautious speed, ensuring there is ample room to stop again if required. If visibility is poor or the traffic situation is uncertain, keep speeds low to react safely to any potential hazards. Maintain a safe distance from the truck in front to allow sufficient time to react to sudden stops or turns. Consider changing lanes if it's safe to do so and if the truck's speed interferes with the flow of traffic, but only after ensuring from the mirrors and blind spot detection (if available) that the adjacent lane is clear. Anticipate potential stops, do not attempt to overtake unless it's clear, and drive cautiously due to reduced nighttime visibility."
