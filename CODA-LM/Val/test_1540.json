Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, partially on the sidewalk, with its tail facing the ego car. This vehicle reduces the drivable width of the ego car's lane and may move unexpectedly, necessitating closer monitoring. Additionally, pedestrians and cyclists are spotted on the right-hand side, near the parked vehicles and towards the buildings. This group could unpredictably enter the roadway, thus heightening the need for the ego car to remain vigilant.\n\nA series of orange traffic cones is strategically placed on the right, marking the boundary of a construction area. This setup guides the ego car to maintain its course to the left to circumvent the construction zone. Alongside the cones, metal barriers and construction debris are observed on the sidewalk and partly in the rightmost lane, signaling ongoing road work and restricting access to that part of the road for the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, construction debris is noted on the right sidewalk beyond the traffic cones. Although it does not block the roadway directly, its proximity suggests a cautionary approach due to potential hazards or movement of workers near the area.\n\nIn this scene, the traffic signs and traffic lights categories contain no items and thus are not considered in the analysis of the current traffic conditions."
