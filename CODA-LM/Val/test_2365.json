To ensure safety, your car must maintain a safe following distance and be alert for the vehicles' potential stops or turns. There is also a white van in the left lane traveling in the same direction, which does not currently pose a threat, but requires monitoring for any sudden changes in its movement. Additionally, there is a truck situated centrally, slightly to the right, in a turning lane facing away from your vehicle, indicating that it is making a left turn, clarifying the intersection layout ahead. A heavy vehicle in the right lane is maintaining a steady speed; however, its size may block vision and affect traffic flow, which calls for an increased following distance.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights are present in the image.\n\nOn the road's right side, orange and white traffic cones are noted, indicating possible road obstructions or construction areas, which means the autonomous vehicle should stay alert and ready to adjust within the lane if necessary. Roadblocks with reflective strips are visible on the front right side of a toll station channel, signifying the potential for a toll booth ahead and prompting the need for the vehicle to watch for signs and adapt to changes in traffic speed. Concrete barriers are positioned behind the traffic cones, creating a physical boundary from the construction or closed-off area, and reinforcing the need for the car to steer clear from closed lanes for safe maneuvering.\n\nFurthermore, a temporary road construction structure or pavilion can be seen on the right, surrounded by railings and traffic cones, marking it as a construction zone. This setup implies a necessity for reduced speed and heightened caution to account for variations in traffic flow and the presence of road workers."

Be aware of the reduced driving space caused by traffic cones and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary for toll booth processing. As you approach the toll booth, stay alert for any potential traffic signs or signals. Self-driving vehicles should monitor the white van on the left, ensuring a safe distance from obstacles on the right and road construction, and be ready to slow down and merge left due to the narrowing drivable lanes indicated by traffic cones. It is recommended to continuously reassess the road ahead to respond to any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic flow, especially near construction zones.",
