A cement mixer truck is to the left and appears to be in motion, as indicated by the slight motion blur. It is positioned in the lane directly adjacent to the ego car. The size and proximity of the cement mixer truck increase the likelihood of it encroaching onto the ego car's lane, potentially affecting lane-changing decisions.\n2. A white SUV is on the right and appears to be stationary or moving slowly in its lane. Its close proximity may influence the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n3. A yellow truck is parked on the right side of the road. This parked truck needs attention as it might obstruct part of the road or reduce visibility.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones and barriers present:\n- Two rows of orange and white traffic cones are positioned to form a division between the driving lanes, directing traffic flow. These cones indicate lane division and merging, guiding the ego vehicle's lane positioning and movement.\n- A large green barrier is present on the right side of the image, creating a boundary between the road and a construction area. It indicates ongoing construction and a potential hindrance or hazard, closing off the right side of the carriageway.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects were observed in this image."
