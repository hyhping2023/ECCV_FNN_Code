The first is a large truck directly in front of the ego car, occupying the full width of the driving lane and appearing to be stationary or moving slowly. This situation requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop if necessary because the truck's size and possible heavy load hinder the ego car's ability to maneuver or overtake. The second observation is a traffic light in the distance, which is currently green. This indicates that the ego car is permitted to proceed. However, given the large truck's presence ahead, it is advised that the ego car continue at a speed that allows for safe stopping or following, depending on the truck's movement. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving scenario in this image."

It is often used to mark off construction areas or road work zones.

If the traffic conditions ahead are not clear or if there is inadequate space to overtake, the ego car should continue to follow the truck at a safe distance and speed until the situation changes."
