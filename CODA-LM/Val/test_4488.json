A white SUV to the left and slightly ahead of our vehicle has its brake lights on, indicating it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This suggests that our vehicle may need to adjust its speed accordingly.\n2. Several cars are visible ahead in my lane and the adjacent lane on the left at varying distances from my vehicle. This affects speed, following distance, and potential lane changing or merging decisions.\n3. In the distance, several vehicles are traveling in the same direction and occupying the lane, determining the overall speed and flow of traffic which the autonomous car needs to adapt to.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian:\nA pedestrian is visible in the distance on the right side but not close to the road, which means they do not pose a direct threat but should be monitored in case they decide to cross the road.\n\nA yellow warning sign indicates road construction ahead, located on the right side in front of the crosswalk. This sign advises reducing speed and heightening alertness due to potential hazards or road workers ahead.\n\nOrange traffic cones are arranged in a line leading to the center of the image, indicating possible construction ahead or lane restrictions. This may require the ego vehicle to adjust its lane position accordingly due to changes in the normal traffic pattern.\n\nFinally, a crane is operating high up near the road on the right. Though it doesnâ€™t directly obstruct the road, its operation necessitates heightened vigilance to guard against unforeseen dangers, potential falling objects, or sudden movements of workers.\n\nThis information outlines the necessary precautions and adjustments required for safe autonomous driving in the depicted traffic scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to construction activities ahead and potential pedestrian crossing areas, please drive carefully. Maintain a safe following distance from the SUV in front and other vehicles in the same lane. Be prepared to stop or slow down at any moment as nearby construction work may lead to rapid changes in traffic conditions. Pay attention to any road construction signs for further instructions and adjustments to your driving behavior. The vehicle should also monitor the lane for any merges or lane changes needed due to traffic cones, and be aware of pedestrians on the far right side.",
