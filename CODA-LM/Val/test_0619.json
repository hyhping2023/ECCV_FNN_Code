The truck's size and nature suggest it could make unexpected movements like slowing down for turns, potentially obstructing the view ahead. This necessitates adjustments in following distance and speed for the ego vehicle.\n\nPartially occluded by the truck, a blue sedan is visible in the right lane ahead of the cement mixer. Its position indicates it's traveling in the same direction, requiring the ego vehicle to be aware of potential lane changes or abrupt slowdowns.\n\nOn the right sidewalk parallel to the road, a cyclist is riding away from the ego vehicle. Even though the cyclist is not on the road, their proximity to traffic means the situation warrants monitoring in case they enter the roadway.\n\nThere are bushes and a low wall on the right side separating the road from the sidewalk. These could hinder visibility of pedestrians or other vehicles entering the roadway from driveways or side streets, posing a potential risk.\n\nAdditionally, there are fixed structures such as bus shelters and signage poles on the side of the road. While not an immediate concern, these indicate areas where pedestrians could be present, necessitating driver awareness."

Monitor the blue sedan ahead for any unexpected lane changes or stops. Stay vigilant for any other road users or changing conditions that may not be immediately visible due to the size and position of the cement mixer truck."
