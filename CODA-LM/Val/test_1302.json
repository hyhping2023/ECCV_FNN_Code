    "driving_suggestion": "Given the visible road users and signs, the ego car should proceed with caution, particularly paying attention to the excavator on the right side, which could indicate active roadwork. The car should maintain a safe distance from the excavator, watch for any roadwork-related signs or personnel, and be prepared to stop or reduce speed if necessary. With the traffic light being green, the ego car may proceed straight through the intersection but should not attempt to turn left. Additionally, be mindful of the green barrier as it may cause a shift in the driving path that needs to be negotiated carefully. Proceed with caution due to the construction work indicated by the excavator and barriers, and be prepared for potential stops or slow-moving construction equipment. Since the traffic light is green, the ego vehicle can continue, but it should lower speed and stay alert for any instructions from construction workers or unexpected obstacles. It's also important to monitor the silver car in the opposite lane for any unexpected behavior."
