        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a variety of road users and objects that the ego vehicle must consider. A yellow school bus is stopped in the rightmost lane with its stop sign extended and red lights flashing, signaling that it is either picking up or dropping off passengers. The ego vehicle must not pass the stopped school bus to ensure the safety of the passengers.\n\nSeveral vehicles, including cars and trucks, are present in front of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction and occupying the lanes. These vehicles dictate the traffic flow and influence the lane choices for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a white SUV is parked on the right-hand side of the road near the ego vehicle. The parked SUV reduces the available road space and could potentially hide pedestrians or other hazards that may appear from the right side.\n\nConstruction vehicles and equipment are also spotted on the right side of the road, indicating an active work zone. This situation calls for cautious driving due to possible hazards or lane closures that the ego vehicle may encounter.\n\nA tow truck is positioned on the right with its platform extended, suggesting ongoing vehicle removal or roadside assistance. The presence of the tow truck indicates that there might be lane blockages or unexpected movements, requiring the ego vehicle to slow down or change lanes to maintain safety.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are observed in the image. Furthermore, there are no other objects like debris or trash bins in the driving environment, eliminating the need for the ego vehicle to navigate around such obstacles."
