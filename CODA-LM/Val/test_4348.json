        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene is currently indiscernible due to the blurriness of the image. This limitation affects the interpretation of all categories of road users and objects. Specifically:\n\n1. Vehicles cannot be identified, rendering it impossible to determine their position, type, or behavior, which is critical for understanding the traffic situation.\n\n2. Vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are not recognizable, so their presence or actions, which require careful attention from the ego car, cannot be ascertained.\n\n3. Traffic signs are not visible, which means that the instructions they would normally convey, crucial for navigation and adherence to road rules, are unavailable.\n\n4. The state of traffic lights cannot be discerned. This lack of information prevents the determination of the right of way, which is essential for safe and legal intersection crossing.\n\n5. Traffic cones, often indicating construction zones or lane closures, cannot be detected. This may affect route planning and the need to navigate around obstructions.\n\n6. Barriers that typically demarcate areas of hazard or protected zones are not visible, making it challenging to interpret lane restrictions or closed areas.\n\n7. Other objects that might influence driving behavior, such as debris or a dustbin which could pose potential hazards, cannot be identified from the image.\n\nOverall, the lack of clarity in the image obstructs the autonomous driving systemâ€™s ability to make informed decisions, recognize traffic elements, and respond appropriately to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations."
