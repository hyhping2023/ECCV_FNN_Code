This truck, due to its size and position, may limit the visibility of the road ahead and obscure any road users that might emerge from behind it. Additionally, an excavator is positioned on the left side behind barriers with its arm extending upwards. Though the excavator is part of a construction site and stationary, signaling roadwork nearby, it does not directly affect traffic.\n\nA blue sign with a white arrow is placed in front of the barriers on the right side, facing left. This sign indicates a diversion or change in traffic flow, directing vehicles to move left.\n\nThere are multiple red and white traffic cones lined up forming a barrier between the construction zone and the part of the road accessible to vehicles. These cones direct the flow of traffic and mark off areas that are off-limits to the ego vehicle due to construction activities.\n\nRed barriers are set up between the roadway and the construction zone on both sides, enclosing the work area. These barriers serve to protect the work zone and ensure that traffic does not enter the construction site.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects are noted in the image."
