The vehicle is in motion and has a visible license plate at the back, with reflective materials on its corners. Due to its size and slow speed, it could potentially impair the flow of traffic, requiring the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes to overtake the vehicle safely. In the distance, over the top of the construction vehicle, a traffic light is visible, showing a green light. This indicates that traffic in the ego car's lane is allowed to proceed. However, the ego car should continue moving forward with caution due to the construction vehicle ahead. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

The vehicle's size and its presence on the road dictate that the driver of the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement ahead. Due caution should be exercised, as construction vehicles often signal road work or changes in traffic patterns that require alert and attentive driving.",

Since the traffic light is green, the car can proceed but should be prepared to change lanes to the left if the construction vehicle continues to move slowly or stops, ensuring it is safe to do so by checking mirrors and blind spots for other road users. Adjust speed according to the flow of traffic and any speed limits that may be in place, prioritizing safety over speed."
