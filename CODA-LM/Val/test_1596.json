        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a large yellow and red industrial truck to the left of our vehicle, which is occupying the left lane and encroaching slightly into our lane. The presence of this truck is significant as it can limit the maneuvering space available to our vehicle and may also block the view of the road ahead. Additionally, there is a silver car driving in the same direction in front of our vehicle. It is important for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance from this car to ensure safety.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a cyclist riding in a dedicated bike lane. Our vehicle needs to be aware of the cyclist's movements to prevent any potential collisions, particularly if the cyclist were to move into the motor vehicle lane. Alongside the road, there are traffic signs indicating the separation of the motor vehicle lane and the bicycle lane, which serve as a reminder that vehicles should stay within their designated lanes.\n\nAt the intersection ahead, the traffic light is green for our lane, signaling that it is safe for our vehicle to proceed. Lastly, there is a red and white traffic pole on the right side of the traffic island. This pole serves as a marker to delineate areas off-limits to vehicle traffic and assists in guiding autonomous vehicles through intersections.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or barriers present in this image, as indicated by the empty categories in the JSON data."

    "driving_suggestion": "This vehicle should maintain its current lane under the guidance of the straight-ahead signal and green light. Due to the presence of a large truck causing limited visibility, a safe distance should be kept from the silver sedan ahead. Reduce speed according to road markings and signs to ensure driving within the designated lane, and be aware of bicycles on the right. Drive carefully and adapt flexibly to the traffic light status and road conditions.",
