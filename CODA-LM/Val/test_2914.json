        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several noteworthy elements impacting driving behavior. Firstly, multiple large sanitation vehicles, including water tankers and sweepers, are parked close to the driving lane on the right side, potentially blocking some traffic lanes or requiring sudden lane changes. Additionally, a silver van is observed traveling in the opposite direction on the left side, necessitating that our vehicle remain vigilant for any adjustments to lane positions or speeds. Moreover, in the distant left lane, there is a yellow school bus which might stop to pick up or drop off passengers, likely causing a slowdown in traffic flow. Besides these vehicles, objects related to the sanitation vehicles' operations are present near the roadside. These might encroach onto the road or necessitate sudden adjustments if sanitation workers step onto the roadway, posing a potential danger to navigating the area safely. All other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are absent in this scene, indicating their lack of immediate relevance to the driving situation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from sanitation vehicles and be vigilant for their potential movements. Due to the slippery road surface, reduce speed, and pay attention to the cargo truck on the left and the vehicles ahead, including school buses that may stop suddenly. Stay alert for roadside workers and equipment that may enter the lane. Prepare to slow down or brake due to traffic congestion, and consider changing lanes when sanitation vehicles block the rightmost lane, anticipating and preparing to merge left, and adjust speed appropriately to accommodate the wet road surface that may affect vehicle control and braking.",
