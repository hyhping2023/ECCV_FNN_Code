The headlights are off, suggesting that the car is not active. This parked vehicle reduces the available space on the road, potentially hiding pedestrians or other hazards. However, since the car is stationary, it is not considered an immediate dynamic threat to traffic. The ego car should still be cautious and keep a safe distance while passing by to prevent any collisions.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is observed ahead, granting the ego vehicle the right to proceed. The driving behavior of the ego car should include the readiness to continue moving but with a sense of caution in case any visibility issues arise that could affect the perception of the light or the intersection's safety.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple dustbins aligned on the sidewalk near the parked car, with some debris scattered around. These are static objects which shouldn't directly impact the ego car's path. However, the proximity of these bins and debris to the road should lead to an alert driving approach, as unexpected movement or falling debris might obstruct the way. Other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers, are not present in this image."
