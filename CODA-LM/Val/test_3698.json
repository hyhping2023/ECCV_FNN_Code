This is reinforced by an adjacent sign displaying an arrow that also points to the left. The presence of this sign suggests road work ahead, and it is crucial that this information be heeded to avoid entering into a potentially hazardous or off-limits area.\n\nAbove the detour sign, a red traffic light is in view. The red light mandates that the ego car must come to a full stop. The vehicle can only proceed once the traffic light turns green, ensuring that the traffic controls are adhered to for safe navigation through the area.\n\nOn the right edge of the image, a single traffic cone is visible. This cone might be marking the perimeter of the construction zone or other road work occurring nearby. Therefore, it is important for the ego car to maintain distance from the cone to avoid any obstructions it may signify.\n\nFurthermore, there are blue and yellow striped barriers that span the entire width of the road, signaling that the road is presently inaccessible, likely due to construction. These barriers, alongside the traffic signs, serve to guide the driver towards an alternate path as indicated by the detour.\n\nNo other objects are observed that could influence the ego car's driving behavior in this scenario."
