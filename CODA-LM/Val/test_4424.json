Its presence may indicate road work or construction, requiring the ego vehicle to potentially change lanes for safety and to avoid obstructions. Additionally, there is a red truck traveling in the same direction on the right side of the ego vehicle, suggesting that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed. A black motorcycle is ahead of the ego vehicle, occupying the same lane and traveling in the same direction, necessitating caution and a safe distance due to the motorcycle's vulnerability. Various other vehicles are visible ahead in the distance, moving in the same direction across both lanes, indicating that the ego car should observe general traffic speed and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary. \n\nAn overhead gantry featuring traffic signs is partially obscured and unreadable, requiring the ego vehicle to remain alert for potential instructions or changes in traffic patterns. Furthermore, debris and waste on the side of the road adjacent to the ego vehicle suggest a lower level of road maintenance and increase the risk of debris on the carriageway, necessitating higher alertness from the ego vehicle."

It is designed to transport to various locations and to use its boom to lift, lower, and horizontally move materials. The presence of such a large construction vehicle on or near the roadway suggests that there may be construction or maintenance work being conducted in the area. For the ego vehicle, this indicates the need to be cautious, as there may be unexpected obstructions, changes in traffic flow, or construction personnel in the vicinity. The driver should be prepared to adhere to any temporary traffic signs, signals, or directions from flaggers and reduce speed as necessary.",

The debris on the side of the road should be noted as it may extend onto the roadway. Keep a safe distance from all vehicles, particularly the motorcycle directly ahead, and stay aware of the red truck that may disrupt the flow of traffic or change lanes. Additionally, pay attention to the gantry which may display important traffic information once it becomes visible."
