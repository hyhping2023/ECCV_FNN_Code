        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals several elements that could impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. \n\nFirstly, there is a white sedan on the left side of the road facing our car. This sedan might be parked or temporarily halted, obstructing part of the lane and requiring our vehicle to navigate around it. Additionally, directly ahead on the path, there is a large yellow construction vehicle with its lights on and the cab raised, indicating it is in operation. This construction vehicle is an obstruction that necessitates the ego vehicle to either stop or take a detour. Furthermore, several vehicles are parked on the right side of the road, which reduces the available road space, necessitating cautious driving as other vehicles attempt to navigate around the construction vehicle.\n\nA pedestrian stands in front of the construction vehicle and seems to be engaged in operating or directing traffic. Recognizing the presence of pedestrians near construction vehicles is crucial for safety, as they may be managing or directing traffic flow.\n\nRed and white traffic cones on the left side of the road mark a designated area or construction zone. These cones serve as signals to the driver not to cross into protected areas and help to guide the flow of traffic.\n\nFinally, due to low visibility conditions, reflections and glare from streetlights and headlights are visible on the camera. These reflections may interfere with the vehicle's camera sensors and perception systems, making it more challenging to accurately assess the surrounding environment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should reduce speed and prepare to stop or carefully navigate around construction vehicles. Pedestrians potentially directing traffic should be given priority consideration. Additionally, drivers should be aware of signals that pedestrians may give or additional road signs that may not be visible in the picture. Vehicles should not attempt to cross areas demarcated by traffic cones or red and white barriers. Before overtaking a crane truck, ensure that the right lane is clear and maintain a safe distance from it. Drivers should also be vigilant for any sudden movements by individuals standing in the roadway and be ready to stop quickly if necessary. Ensuring the safety of workers and avoiding entry into the work area are of the utmost priority.",
