                "explanation": "Due to its size and position, this vehicle may obstruct the ego car's path and limit the visibility of the road ahead. Its brake lights indicate a potential slow down that the ego car must be prepared for. The construction vehicle's size and slow speed require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or to maneuver around if safe and legal to do so. This construction vehicle may move slowly or make sudden stops due to its operation, which requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down accordingly."

        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a large yellow construction vehicle with a crane arm, occupying the center lane directly in front of the ego vehicle. It has its brake lights on, which may indicate it is slowing down or coming to a stop. This construction vehicle is significant enough to obstruct the ego car's path and limit visibility ahead. Moreover, its operation might cause it to move slowly or stop abruptly, requiring the ego car to keep a safe distance and be ready to respond to changes.\n\nAdditionally, to the right of the scene, there's a traffic sign on a pole which is partially obscured by the construction vehicle's arm. This sign likely relates to road work or carries a similar warning, signaling that there may be construction activities ahead and urging reduced speed and increased alertness.\n\nAs for the traffic light situation, there is a green signal at the next intersection, suggesting that while vehicles are permitted to proceed, they need to be cautious due to the construction vehicle's presence which could lead to unpredictable movements.\n\nWe have no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image, indicating these elements do not impact the current driving scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle, specifically designed for tasks such as moving heavy materials or earthmoving. Due to its size and the nature of the load it is carrying, the vehicle may be moving slower than smaller passenger vehicles and may make wide turns. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance to allow for sufficient reaction time if the construction vehicle stops suddenly or makes unexpected movements. Additionally, the driver should be cautious when attempting to overtake the construction vehicle, ensuring there is ample space and visibility, and be aware of any signals indicating the vehicle may be turning or merging.",

It is also advisable to monitor the construction vehicle's indicators or any hand signals for a possible turn or lane switch, especially since the visibility ahead may be compromised. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car can continue moving forward, but should be ready to adjust speed based on the actions of the road users ahead. Maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead to ensure sufficient reaction time. Prepare to reduce speed or stop if the construction vehicle performs unexpected maneuvers. Monitor the traffic light for any changes and be cautiously ready to proceed if the situation ahead clears and the light remains green. Always be prepared to adjust speed according to the road conditions and any additional road users or signals that may come into view. Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead to allow for adequate reaction time. Pay attention to potential road signs that may indicate construction work or lane closures ahead, even though the current sign is not fully visible. Be ready for the possibility of slow-moving or stopping vehicles and adjust speed accordingly. No immediate lane change appears necessary, but stay vigilant for any road work indications that might require it."
