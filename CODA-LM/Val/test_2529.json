These parked vehicles restrict the road width and reduce visibility, necessitating cautious driving to avoid any unexpected movements from these cars.\n\nFurthermore, a pedestrian accompanied by a small dog is crossing the road from left to right and is currently midway across the ego car's lane. This pedestrian represents the most critical road user due to their vulnerability and the unpredictable nature of the situation, especially because the dog could potentially behave erratically.
