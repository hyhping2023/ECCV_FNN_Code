        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements, including vehicles, traffic signs, and traffic cones.\n\nVehicles:\n1. A large red construction vehicle is present in the scene. It occupies the right lane and is also partially obstructing the left lane. Its arm is extended upwards, and the vehicle is either stationary or moving at a very slow pace. The reason this vehicle is a potential hazard is due to its interference with the normal flow of traffic, which may lead to other vehicles having to navigate around it, possibly by entering the opposing lane of traffic.\n2. Ahead of the ego vehicle, in the left lane, there is a white sedan facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. This sedan is significant as it is directly in front of the ego car, thereby affecting the following distance and speed. It also influences the ego vehicle's decision when it comes to maneuvering around the construction vehicle ahead.\n\nTraffic Signs:\nThere is a traffic sign visible in the imageâ€”a blue sign with a white arrow pointing upwards to the left, placed just above the sedan. The sign indicates that the traffic lane can be used either to move forward or to turn left. It's important as it provides guidance on lane selection for the road layout that lies ahead.\n\nTraffic Cones:\nOn the right-hand side of the road, in front of the construction vehicle, orange traffic cones are placed. These cones signal that construction or road work is underway. The presence of these cones indicates that drivers should proceed with caution, anticipate that lanes might be reduced or blocked, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects described in the image."

They are designed to be highly visible and are often used to signal construction or road work, accidents, or other temporary hazards. For the ego car's future driving behavior, the presence of a traffic cone suggests that there may be a hazard or obstruction ahead and that the driver should proceed with caution, potentially preparing to change lanes if necessary to avoid the area indicated by the cone.",

If it is safe to do so, the ego car may need to cautiously overtake the construction vehicle using the opposite traffic lane when it is clear, or follow the white sedan's lead."
