It is occupying the opposite lane, suggesting a need for caution from the ego vehicle's driver, who should be prepared to stop or yield to avoid a potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, the scene contains several parked cars on both sides of the street. The parked cars limit the available road width, which means the ego car must slow down and navigate carefully through the reduced space to ensure safe passage.\n\nA 'No Entry' sign is also present to the right of the scene, signaling that the road ahead is not open to traffic in that direction. It's clear that the ego car will have to take an alternative route instead of proceeding forward.\n\nLastly, obstacles are noted in the road, including a blue trolley with bins placed in the center of the road ahead and piles of bags and other items to the right. These objects narrow the drivable path and require the ego vehicle to maneuver around them to continue its journey."

The ego car will need to navigate around the moped while maintaining a safe distance to avoid any contact with it.

It should also not proceed straight ahead due to the 'No Entry' sign and should plan for a safe turn at the next available opportunity while monitoring the white SUV's movement and giving it the right of way since it is in the opposite lane. Caution should be exercised due to the parked cars on each side that could potentially obscure pedestrians or other road users merging into the roadway. The driver should also stay vigilant for any erratic movements by the trolley and adjust the course accordingly while maintaining a safe berth from the road debris and bags on the right side."
