Stay in the current lane unless overtaking or directed by road signs or construction workers. Keep a safe distance from the barriers and traffic cones to avoid collisions, and proceed with caution due to the narrowed lanes and potential presence of construction workers or equipment. Monitor the white car ahead as well as opposite-direction traffic for any possible interruptions, and proceed straight as directed by road markings."
