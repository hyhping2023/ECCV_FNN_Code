This vehicle's proximity and position may cause the ego car to slow down or change lanes to ensure a safe passing distance. Multiple overhead directional signs indicate lanes and directions for branching roads ahead, essential for the ego car to determine which lane to take for the desired route. Traffic lights ahead are currently red, requiring the ego car to stop at the intersection to comply with traffic rules and ensure safety. Metal guardrails are along the right side of the road, separating the roadway from other areas and influencing the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the road's edge. Additionally, raindrops visible on the camera lens suggest rainy or wet road conditions, reducing tire traction and increasing stopping distances, necessitating the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly."

While operating near roadways, it can influence the traffic flow and may require other vehicles to slow down, change lanes, or stop to maintain safety. The presence of such a vehicle suggests the potential for nearby construction activity, which drivers should be cautious of, potentially leading to changes in normal traffic patterns and requiring heightened awareness.",
