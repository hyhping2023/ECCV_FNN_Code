The presence of these vehicles reduces the available width of the road for maneuvering, which requires that any passing vehicles be particularly vigilant. This vigilance is crucial to prevent potential collisions with pedestrians that might emerge unexpectedly from between the parked vehicles. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a low speed to be able to react to the potential actions of motorcyclists and dogs. It is crucial to continuously observe the behavior of these road users. If a dog runs into the vehicle's path, the vehicle should be prepared to stop, be mindful of parked vehicles on the right, and ensure a safe distance from the motorcycle. Watch for any movement between parked vehicles to anticipate the possible emergence of pedestrians or other road users, and monitor the motorcycle's trajectory. Additionally, the yellow and black striped barriers can be used to identify the edge of the road, assisting in maintaining a safe driving lane. In summary, being cautious and always ready to adapt to dynamically changing situations is key.",

The driver of the ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary to avoid a collision. Caution must be exercised as the dog may move unpredictably.",
