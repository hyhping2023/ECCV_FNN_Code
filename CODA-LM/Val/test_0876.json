        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a white sedan with emergency warning lights on its roof directly ahead of the subject vehicle, either stationary or moving slowly in the same lane. This situation suggests the possibility of an emergency or law enforcement activity, requiring vehicles to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or deviations in traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is crossing the street from right to left in front of a parked sedan while pushing a stroller and leading a dog. This requires the vehicle to slow down and yield to ensure the pedestrian's safety, as pedestrians may suddenly enter the road, necessitating vigilance and readiness to stop.\n\nFurthermore, a cyclist is traveling in the same direction as the car, positioned on the left side of the lane. The vehicle must keep a safe distance and be ready for a safe overtaking maneuver, as cyclists can move unpredictably and may change their route without warning.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a metal railing separating the sidewalk from the road, which serves to delineate the space for pedestrians and vehicles, restricting lateral movement and marking the boundaries of the driving lanes. Vehicles should keep a safe distance from the right edge of the road.\n\nLastly, overhead cables are present, spanning the road. These are fixed infrastructure and typically do not affect driving behavior unless they fall or pose an unexpected danger."

    "driving_suggestion": "Vehicles should reduce speed and prepare to stop, yielding to pedestrians and ensuring a safe passing distance from cyclists. Maintain a safe following distance from the white sedan ahead, especially considering its emergency lights, and be ready to respond to sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. Pay attention to the status of traffic lights and comply with their signals, preparing for possible phase changes. Stay within lane markings and keep a safe distance from obstacles on the right side of the road. Overall, drive cautiously and at a reduced speed to adapt to potential risks presented by road users and the environment.",
