        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, the scene includes several vehicles and various other objects that influence driving behavior. Specifically, a white van is observed parked on the right side of the road, slightly tilted toward the roadway. Its front faces a direction perpendicular to the vehicle's orientation. This positioning may partially obstruct the lane, necessitating a slight shift to the left by our vehicle to safely overtake the van. Furthermore, numerous cars are parked on both sides of the road, creating a narrow path that our car must navigate through. This arrangement of parked vehicles significantly reduces the driving space, mandating extra caution to prevent any collisions.\n\nAdditionally, there are prominent objects on the road which could impact navigation and safety. Close to the parked white van, on the left side, there is a pile of snow or debris. This indicates that the road edge might be narrower or have unpredictable conditions, advising a cautious approach when driving past. Moreover, an intense glare from a light source, potentially a streetlight, is present. This glare could interfere with driver visibility and the function of camera-based systems in autonomous vehicles. As such, when approaching this area, it is crucial for autonomous vehicles to consider the possibility of reduced visibility and adjust their driving strategies accordingly.\n\nAbsent from the scene are vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers, suggesting that these elements do not directly influence the current driving context as interpreted from the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and reduce speed to ensure sufficient reaction time. Watch for any potential movement from parked vans and make sure there is ample clearance when passing by. Be prepared to navigate cautiously between vehicles parked ahead and be aware of other road users who may be obscured by or emerge from between parked vehicles. Due to poor lighting conditions and glare from light sources, be ready for limited visibility. Drivers or autonomous driving systems should also be prepared to stop suddenly if necessary. Use headlights appropriately to improve visibility, while being mindful not to dazzle other road users.",
