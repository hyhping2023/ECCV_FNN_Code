        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, a series of orange and white traffic cones with reflective stripes are observed. They are positioned in a staggered configuration across the lane, effectively guiding traffic to veer towards the left. This setup suggests the presence of road construction or potential hazards lying ahead, necessitating a change from the current lane or a reduction in the number of lanes available to vehicular traffic. No other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or additional objects are present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "As the vehicle approaches the traffic cones, the driver should also gradually reduce speed, drive carefully, and ensure not to make any sudden maneuvers that could lead to unsafe interactions with road obstacles or potentially veer into oncoming traffic lanes (if any). Since there are no other road users or road signs significantly affecting the driving scenario, attention should be focused on the vehicle ahead and the traffic cones. If not already turned on, it is recommended to use low beam headlights to avoid dazzling oncoming drivers and to ensure the road ahead is sufficiently illuminated. The vehicle should slow down and prepare to change lanes to the left following the path indicated by the traffic cones. Stay alert for any workers, additional signs, or instructions, and comply with the reduced speed limits typically associated with construction or road work zones.",

Placed on the road, it usually signals that drivers should move away from a certain area due to construction, an accident, or another road obstruction. The ego car must steer around this cone to continue on the open lane.",
