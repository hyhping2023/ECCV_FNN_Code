Firstly, there is a light-colored vehicle on the left, positioned in front of our car and traveling in the same direction. This car's potential actions, such as slowing down, stopping, or changing lanes, will directly influence the driving behavior of our vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, on the right, a white truck is parked vertically by the roadside, partially obstructing the lane. This truck represents a static obstacle, and autonomous vehicles must be ready to navigate narrower lanes or anticipate other vehicles that may merge into their lane due to the truck's presence.\n\nThere are also several pedestrians on the right side of the road, engaging with a street vendor. The proximity of these pedestrians to the road and their potential for unpredictable movements heightens the risk of accidents, necessitating increased vigilance from the self-driving car.\n\nFurthermore, metal fencing is present, encircling the area where the truck is parked on the right side of the road. This fencing indicates a blockade area, which may lead to reduced lane width and require drivers to adjust their driving path accordingly.\n\nLastly, various items and debris are scattered along the right edge of the road, close to where pedestrians are standing. While these objects are not currently on the road, there is a possibility that pedestrians might inadvertently interact with or move them, creating potential distractions or obstacles for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones that need to be considered in this summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a cautious speed and be ready to stop at any time. Pay attention to the braking or lane-changing signals of the vehicle in front. If the lane ahead is obstructed by parked trucks or obstacles, prepare to merge left in advance. Keep a continuous watch for pedestrian activity on the right to prevent them from suddenly stepping onto the road. Lastly, be alert to any objects that might appear on the driving lane at all times. Reduce speed due to wet road conditions. Always be aware of pedestrians who may suddenly cross the road. Keep a safe distance from parked vehicles to avoid sudden door openings or the vehicle starting to move. If it's safe, prepare to navigate around obstacles and traffic cones on the right, which may require moving to the left, ensuring not to hinder pedestrians. Drive cautiously in this mixed-use area where vehicles and pedestrians closely interact.",
