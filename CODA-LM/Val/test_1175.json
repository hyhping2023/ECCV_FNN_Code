Further ahead, a police car is also traveling in the same lane as the ego car, suggesting the need for cautious and lawful driving behavior as the police car might be responding to an incident that could affect future traffic conditions.\n\nTraffic lights ahead are in an indeterminate state due to visibility issues, necessitating preparedness for stopping or continuing based on the light's current color.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are placed in the rightmost lane, starting close to the ego vehicle and continuing ahead, indicating a lane closure. This mandates that the ego vehicle stay in its current lane or safely change lanes if needed.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on the rightmost side of the highway, separating the traffic lanes from the emergency lane or a construction site. These barriers define the drivable area and limit the ego car's ability to maneuver to the right, requiring caution when passing near them.\n\nDust on the windshield may reduce visibility and slightly impair the ability to detect and respond to traffic elements, advising extra caution. Additionally, a white car is parked on the side of the road, on the right, partially obstructing the closed rightmost lane but not affecting the flowing traffic lanes.

Always be on the lookout for any additional signs, signals, or road users that may come into view. Proceed with caution respecting the green light, but be prepared to stop if the lights change due to the distance from the intersection. Stay clear of the traffic cones and barriers; do not attempt to merge right due to the cones in your lane. Consider using windshield wipers to clear the dust for better visibility."
