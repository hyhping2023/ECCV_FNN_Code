Among the road users, there is a notable presence of a person standing on the right side of the road behind a barrier. This situation could potentially pose a hazard, as there is a chance the individual might attempt to enter the road unexpectedly, necessitating a cautious approach by the ego car.\n\nIn terms of road infrastructure, there is a green fence located on the right side of the road, signaling a construction or restricted area. This fence serves as a warning of possible road conditions changes or the presence of workers, requiring increased vigilance and a readiness to adapt.\n\nThe scene also features traffic cones, specifically orange and white ones, arranged to block off the right-hand lane, effectively reducing the road from three lanes to two. These cones signify ongoing roadwork or a lane closure ahead, warning the ego car not to enter this lane and to prepare for a merge if it's currently in the affected lane.\n\nAdditionally, a temporary green construction barrier is placed along the right side of the road. It delineates the active lanes from a designated construction or restricted area. The presence of this barrier underlines the need for the ego car to proceed with care due to potential road work and the proximity of workers or machinery to the roadway.\n\nLastly, regarding other objects, the scene is free of any debris, dustbins, or other hazards within the drivable area of the road. This absence indicates that there are no immediate physical obstructions that the ego car needs to navigate around, contributing to a smoother transit through the area."

Reduce speed appropriately as you approach the area with the construction barrier to anticipate any sudden changes or movements from the roadwork area. Stay alert for any workers or machinery that might impact road safety. Maintain the current lane, observe the speed limit, and remain alert for any movements by the person near the roadside or any unexpected changes in the road conditions due to the cones and barrier. Reduce speed if necessary while passing the marked off area. The ego car should remain in the left lane, maintain a safe speed that allows for reactive measures, and monitor the figure by the traffic cones closely for any indications of movement towards the driving lanes. Caution should be exercised due to potential construction activity indicated by the green fence and traffic cones."
