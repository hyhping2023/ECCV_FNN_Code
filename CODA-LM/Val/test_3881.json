These barriers have yellow and black warning patterns and are obstructing the path of the ego vehicle as well as any other traffic. The presence of these barriers suggests that there is a closed road or a construction zone ahead. Consequently, this requires the ego vehicle to alter its driving path to navigate around the obstruction. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

It is placed across the street, indicating that the road ahead is closed or that there's ongoing construction or an event that requires traffic rerouting. The presence of this barrier requires the ego car to stop and either turn around or find an alternate route, as proceeding forward is not possible due to the obstruction.",

The vehicle should not attempt to drive around or through the barriers, as they indicate a closed road ahead. Navigation should be updated to find an alternative route. If the vehicle is equipped with a navigation system, it should recalculate the route to the desired destination. If manual intervention is required, the driver should safely reverse and follow detour signs if available or turn around where it's safe to do so."
