These temporary traffic signs inform drivers of the restriction and require the ego car to be ready to adjust its route accordingly.\n\nThe traffic light in the upper right-hand side of the image shows a red signal to the right and a green light on the left. The red light instructs vehicles to stop, while the green light on the left suggests there might be an alternative path available for the ego car if it can change lanes.\n\nReflective traffic cones are placed in front of the truck, creating a visual barrier to cordon off the construction or no-entry zone. They guide traffic to avoid the blocked area, indicating the need for caution and providing a navigational path around the truck.\n\nLastly, the area is poorly lit, with some lights reflecting off surfaces, which could potentially affect visual sensors or a driver's ability to see clearly.
