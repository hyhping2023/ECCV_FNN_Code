Although the parked car is not blocking the lane, caution is advised as the person may unexpectedly open the door or step onto the road.

Additionally, a white van and several motorcycles are observed on the left side of the road, moving away from the ego vehicle.

These vehicles require attention for any changes in speed, lane changes, or unexpected maneuvers. Vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians moving along the side of the road and crossing the street, along with a cyclist riding on the right side, are also present. These individuals may change directions or enter the driving path of the ego car, which calls for vigilant observation and readiness to react accordingly.\n\nRegarding traffic signs and traffic lights, there are none visible in the image, which means standard road rules and right-of-way conventions should be followed, and the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, respectively. There are no traffic cones or barriers in the image, indicating that there are no roadworks, lane closures, or barriers affecting the driving paths available to the ego vehicle. No other objects are mentioned in the data provided."
