The presence of the parked car should be kept in mind by the autonomous vehicle, ensuring it maintains a safe distance. This precaution is essential to mitigate potential hazards such as car doors opening suddenly or pedestrians that may emerge from around the car, although it is not currently obstructing the driving lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there are large cable reels resting against a wall on the roadside, well away from the vehicle's driving lane. There are also smaller reels and a black trash can in proximity to these cable reels. While these items do not present any immediate threat to the vehicle since they are outside of the road boundaries, it will be essential for the vehicleâ€™s sensors to remain vigilant and monitor for any unforeseen shifts in the position of these objects that could influence driving conditions. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not contain any items in this particular image and therefore are not relevant in this context."

While it might not directly influence the driving behavior of a vehicle on the road if it stays in its current position, it's important to remain cautious. If such an object were to roll onto the road, it could pose a significant hazard to vehicles. The ego car should therefore maintain awareness of potential obstacles that could enter the roadway unexpectedly, especially when driving in areas with nearby construction or industrial equipment.",

This object does not have a direct influence on the ego car's driving behavior, as it is stationary and placed well off the roadway.
