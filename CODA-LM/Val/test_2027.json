    "driving_suggestion": "Please drive cautiously and maintain a safe distance from trucks to avoid blocked vision or potential debris splattering. Be aware of road construction signs and cones, steer clear of marked areas, and be prepared to navigate through possibly narrow spaces near construction obstacles. Slow down to accommodate road conditions and be vigilant for any unexpected maneuvers from trucks ahead. Self-driving vehicles should anticipate the possibility of slow-moving or stopped utility vehicles ahead, and thus should reduce speed. They should closely monitor the actions of utility vehicles and be ready to change lanes safely and when necessary. Drivers should also watch for directional signs to gather possible navigation information and comply with any indicated changes. Due to the presence of traffic cones, which may indicate road construction or lane narrowing, self-driving vehicles should maintain a safe distance from them and be mindful of any indicated changes in speed limits or nearby workers. Road conditions suggest that caution is necessary to avoid any damage to the vehicle. Maintain a safe following distance behind tanker trucks and be ready to slow down if the truck slows. Stay alert for any merging traffic from the right and do not attempt to overtake the truck unless you have a clear view of the merge point and ensure the adjacent lane is free of obstacles and safe for merging. Because the area indicated by cones for road work may be active, appropriate speed reduction should be applied.",
