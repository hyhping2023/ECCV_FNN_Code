Although it's moving away, monitoring such heavy equipment is crucial because of potential unexpected movements or debris. Furthermore, overhead gantry signs visible in the scene provide important informational texts. These signs don't directly influence the immediate behavior of autonomous vehicles but are vital for guidance and positioning. All other categories, including vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, are not present in this particular traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "While remaining in the current lane, pay attention to observe whether construction vehicles deviate unexpectedly. Take note of any possible road changes or directions on the overhead signs, but there is no need for immediate action at this time. Continue to follow standard driving rules, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, and travel at an appropriate speed based on road conditions and traffic laws. Due to the presence of construction trucks and signs indicating road curves, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed and be ready to change lanes when necessary. Additionally, the driver should be vigilant for any temporary traffic lights or construction workers directing traffic, as these situations can alter the normal traffic pattern and require special attention. The vehicle should keep a safe following distance from construction vehicles, be prepared to respond to potential stops or turns of large vehicles, and drive at a speed suitable for wet and slippery road conditions. Furthermore, keep an eye on the overhead directional signs to ensure the vehicle stays in the correct lane of the intended route.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, which appears to be a heavy equipment piece such as an excavator or backhoe, typically used for digging, lifting, and moving materials at construction sites. Its presence on or near the roadway suggests ongoing construction work or the transport of construction machinery. The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for potential stops or detours as the construction vehicle may indicate the presence of a construction zone ahead. Depending on local laws, there could be reduced speed limits and increased fines for traffic violations in such areas. The driver should be vigilant for construction workers, additional construction machinery crossing the road, or instructions from traffic control personnel.",
