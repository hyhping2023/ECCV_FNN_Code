The van is stationary and does not directly affect the immediate path of the main vehicle, but it may obstruct the view of oncoming traffic on the left or changes in road conditions. Additionally, on the right side, there are large cable spools, some stacked and others standing upright, occupying part of the anticipated vehicle traffic area. These objects may obstruct the road, and this should be taken into account when planning routes to ensure the safety of one's own vehicle and the protection of road infrastructure. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

The vehicle should slow down and check for any oncoming traffic that may be obscured by parked vans or spools, and maintain a safe distance from the vans and spools parked on the left. If necessary, the vehicle should stop to reassess the situation and look for a safe route forward, which may involve waiting for any obstructed vehicles to pass or waiting until the road ahead is clearer in view.",

In terms of influence on driving, if this object were to be found in or near a roadway, it could pose a significant hazard due to its size and potential to obstruct the path of the ego car. Special care must be taken to avoid such obstacles, which may involve slowing down and navigating carefully around them if safe to do so. If the reels are securely stored and not on the road, they pose no direct threat to the ego car's immediate driving path.",

Its presence suggests the need for caution, as objects of this size could pose a hazard if they were to roll or shift into the path of the vehicle. The driver of the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to adjust their trajectory if necessary to avoid any potential obstacles emanating from the object's position.",
