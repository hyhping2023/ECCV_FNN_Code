        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large vehicle, possibly a truck, ahead in the right lane. Its rear red lights are on, which may indicate that it is slowing down or preparing to move. Due to its size and the space it occupies, it's important for the driving behavior to maintain a safe distance and be ready for any potential deceleration or stop.\n\nAdditionally, traffic signs are visible on the right side of the road, adjacent to the traffic light. These signs likely provide lane usage instructions, critical for understanding the flow of traffic and ensuring the vehicle is in the correct lane for the intended route.\n\nA critical observation is the red traffic light ahead, which is in effect for all lanes. This red light means that the vehicle must come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for a green signal before continuing on safely.\n\nAlso present are traffic cones positioned on the right side of the road, suggesting that part of the road or a lane may be closed off due to construction or roadwork. These cones serve to direct traffic away from hazards or areas under maintenance, and a lane change might be necessary if they are blocking a closed lane.\n\nThere is a physical barrier or curb on the right side of the road as well. It serves to separate different lanes of traffic and implies that lane changes to the right may be prohibited. The vehicle should not try to cross these barriers.\n\nLastly, on the far right, there are additional barriers and traffic cones that may indicate ongoing road construction or lane closures. While these are not in the direct path of the vehicle, they should be noted since they could affect traffic patterns or require an earlier lane change.\n\nNo vulnerable road users are present in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain an appropriate speed while closely monitoring any changes in speed or direction of the truck ahead. Follow directional signs, stay in the correct lane, and be prepared for possible road works or lane changes indicated by cone markers and barriers. Continuously monitor the traffic lights to respond to any changes. Maintain a safe distance from the truck in front, be ready to come to a complete stop at intersections due to red light signals, and stay in the current lane as directed by signs and physical obstacles. Self-driving vehicles should approach intersections cautiously, preparing to stop for visible red lights, and remain alert for any changes in the signal. Considering that there are traffic cones and obstacles on the roadside, self-driving vehicles should also be ready to change lanes when necessary while ensuring safety. At present, there is no need to take immediate action for road conditions or other objects.",

            "description and explanation": "A series of cone-shaped traffic barriers has been placed alongside the roadway, creating a physical demarcation between the active lanes of traffic and an area that is potentially under construction or out of service. These barriers are typically used to guide drivers safely through or around traffic disruptions, work zones, or to redirect traffic patterns. The presence of these objects suggests that the driver of the ego car should remain alert and possibly prepare to merge or change lanes if the adjacent lane is blocked ahead.",
