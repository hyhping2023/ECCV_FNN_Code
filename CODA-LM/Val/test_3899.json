The potential for sudden stops or reduced visibility requires cautious driving as the truck's size and proximity could obstruct the view ahead, making it difficult to anticipate traffic conditions and potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there are no clear traffic signs visible in the image, which means the ego car should adhere to standard road rules and pay close attention to other road users. A traffic light is seen in the distance, currently showing green. While the green light suggests that the ego car can proceed, there needs to be readiness to stop or slow down in case it changes to yellow or red by the time the car approaches. The image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects."

Proceed with caution towards the intersection while monitoring the green traffic light for any changes. Speed should be adjusted according to the traffic flow and any potential risks that could arise from the truck's movements or from other unseen road users that might intersect the ego car's path at the upcoming intersection. Continue to observe the environment for any new developments such as pedestrians or other road users entering the scene. Additionally, keep an eye on the rear-view and side mirrors for other vehicles that may be approaching quickly, that might want to overtake or change lanes."
