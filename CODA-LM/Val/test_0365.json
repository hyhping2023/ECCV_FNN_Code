        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a large white truck parked obstructively at an angle on the bicycle lane extending partially into the main traffic lane. The truck has its front facing towards the camera and poses a potential hazard by blocking part of the road. This unusual parking of the truck indicates that there may be unexpected road conditions ahead, such as a malfunction or an accident. Consequently, approaching vehicles, including our autonomous vehicle, must proceed with caution, possibly slowing down and preparing to change lanes in order to navigate past the truck safely.\n\nAdditionally, there are blue circular mandatory traffic signs positioned on a pole on the traffic island to the right. One sign commands drivers to turn right while the other permits the continuation of travel to the left. These signs are essential in guiding the drivers, as they stipulate the compulsory directions that must be followed, thereby ensuring safe and orderly flow of traffic.\n\nOn the same traffic island, yellow and black barriers are installed which serve as a median strip. The function of these is to separate different streams of traffic moving in opposite directions and prevent any vehicle from crossing the central divider. This measure aims to minimize the risk of head-on collisions and maintain the smooth transition of vehicles in their respective lanes.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or additional objects are reported in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should immediately slow down, turn on the hazard warning lights to alert the vehicles behind, and be prepared to change lanes to the left if necessary, while also being mindful of cyclists who may bypass the blocked bike lane. Exercise caution when passing trucks and debris. Given the parked truck on the left, the vehicle should carefully switch to the left lane to pass the truck while complying with the blue traffic sign instructions, ensuring that any maneuvers are well-indicated and take into account the wet and slippery road conditions. Since the road may be slippery, it is important to maintain a reduced speed and be aware of any further obstacles or debris in the vehicle's path.",

The ego car will need to take note of this barrier and maintain a safe distance, ensuring it navigates away from the obstructed lane and continues driving in an open lane.",
