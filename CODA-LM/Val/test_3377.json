The proximity to the truck and its size are both factors that could significantly impact the decision-making of the ego car; close following requires caution and readiness to respond to the truck's actions."

The truck's brake lights are illuminated, indicating that it might be slowing down or has come to a stop. The clear visibility of the truck's plate and rear lights suggests that the ego vehicle is in close proximity to the truck. As a result, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop, taking into account the truck's size and the need for caution due to the close following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible ahead, which is currently red and located above the truck in the field of view. The ego car is required to come to a complete stop at the traffic signal in compliance with traffic laws and to ensure safety. The vehicle must remain stationary until the traffic light turns green before it can proceed."

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial vehicle commonly known as a truck is visible. The back of the truck shows a closed cargo area with reflective safety markings, designed to be easily visible to other road users in low-light conditions. These reflective markings are typically found on commercial vehicles to enhance safety by increasing visibility. The lights on the truck are illuminated, suggesting that the truck's engine is on or that it is in active use. In driving scenarios, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance from the truck to ensure sufficient reaction time in case the truck slows or stops suddenly. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for limited visibility ahead due to the size of the truck, which can obstruct the view of the road conditions further ahead.",

Maintaining a safe following distance is crucial, especially since large vehicles like the truck may obscure traffic lights or other road users ahead. The ego car should also monitor any potential movement from the sides of the truck in case other vehicles or road users attempt to merge or cross at the intersection. The driver should be attentive for when the traffic light turns green and also watch for the truck's movements, as it will lead the way when the light changes."
