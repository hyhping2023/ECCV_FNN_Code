Additionally, there are several cars in the adjacent lanes to the left of the ego car. These vehicles may change lanes or adjust speed, therefore requiring monitoring for potential evasive maneuvers. There is also a white sedan in the leftmost lane parallel to the ego car. This vehicle is in close proximity and within the same direction of travel, potentially impacting lane change decisions by the ego car.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a temporarily mounted yellow sign with a rightward arrow, indicating a lane shift or detour ahead. The ego car should prepare to adjust its position in response to the altered lane conditions up ahead.\n\nFurthermore, orange and white barriers are present on the right side, separating the construction zone from the road. They indicate that a part of the road or sidewalk is unavailable for use and could narrow the available driving space for the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."
