This situation necessitates a change in the ego vehicle's path to avoid a collision and to comply with traffic rules.\n\nA black SUV is partially visible to the far left of the frame. Although the SUV doesn't seem to be directly influencing the behavior of the ego car at the moment, it must be monitored for any potential changes.\n\nA person is also spotted to the right of the stopped van, partially obscured from view, and appears to be involved in the unloading process. The presence of this person near the ego vehicle's trajectory presents a safety hazard and will require careful maneuvering to ensure their safety.\n\nOn the right side of the road, blue traffic cones are aligned, indicating a no-entry zone or directing traffic to take a different path. This likely signifies a temporary alteration in traffic patterns, which could be due to ongoing road work or an event, and means that vehicles will need to maintain a certain distance or choose an alternate lane.\n\nAdditional blue traffic cones are positioned alongside the parked van, marking a boundary for a work zone or area that vehicles are not supposed to enter, consequently narrowing the drivable path available for the ego car.\n\nFinally, there is a cart with items next to the open rear hatch of the white van that extends into the traffic lane, adding to the lane obstruction and posing a potential hazard that must be navigated around with caution.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to the complexity of the driving scene and require attentive and adaptive responses from the autonomous driving system to ensure a safe and rule-compliant navigation through the area."
