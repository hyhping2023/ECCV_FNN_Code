An orange excavator is positioned partially on the road and the adjacent dirt area to the left, with its digging arm extended towards the ground. The presence of the excavator on the road requires vigilance from drivers as it occupies space and may move unpredictably.\n2. A yellow wheel loader is stationary on the right side of the road, slightly angled towards it. Drivers should be cautious as the wheel loader could potentially move into the road, obstructing traffic and posing a danger. It is important to watch for any signs of movement.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There is a folded portable traffic sign on the ground to the right, which could indicate construction or a road closure. This sign suggests that there may be changing road conditions ahead or a potential detour that drivers need to be aware of.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Several red and white traffic cones are lined up on the right, marking the boundary of a construction area. These cones serve to indicate a temporary alteration in traffic patterns, directing vehicles away from areas that are off-limits, possibly due to road work or a hazard.\n\nBarriers:\n- A metal barrier with red and white stripes is located on the far right, behind the wheel loader. This barrier signifies the demarcation of a construction zone, signaling a no-access area that could significantly affect how vehicles navigate through the area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."
