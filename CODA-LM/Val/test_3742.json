It should not attempt a left turn where prohibited by the traffic sign and should stay within the lane demarcated by the traffic cones. It is important to continuously monitor the white car to the right for any potential lane changes or other unexpected behaviors. Additionally, the pedestrian observed on the sidewalk should be continually monitored; even though they are not on the road, unexpected pedestrian movements must be considered. Lastly, the ego car should stay within its lane markers while avoiding close proximity to the right-side delineators. Maintaining situational awareness and readiness to react to the changes in the environment is crucial."
