        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, a large yellow construction loader is observed partially obstructing the right side of the road, oriented perpendicular to the flow of traffic and extending from the curb into the lane. The visibility of the loader's rear is not clear, nor are the operator's intentions. This construction vehicle represents a potential hazard as it may be either in motion or in the process of operating, which necessitates the ego car to adjust its trajectory or speed accordingly to safely navigate past the obstruction. \n\nTo complement this, orange traffic cones are positioned on the ground beside the construction vehicle, setting a boundary to demarcate the construction area. These cones are in place to inform drivers, including the ego vehicle, of the need to not cross into the defined construction zone as it navigates the area.\n\nA long, continuous blue barrier runs alongside the road on the right, serving as an indication of a construction zone, which concurrently limits the width of the road available for driving. This barrier suggests the presence of construction activity near the driving lane, implicating the existence of workers, machinery, or changes in the road surface. Therefore, the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and exercise caution upon approach.\n\nIn addition to the larger obstacles, some debris is spotted on the right side of the road in close proximity to the construction zone, likely resulting from the construction activities. This debris could pose a risk to the vehicle's tires and undercarriage; hence, it is advisable for the ego car to steer clear of these hazards while passing the area. \n\nIn summary, the traffic image contains important indications of construction activity including a construction loader, traffic cones, a barrier, and debris which collectively influence the driving behavior and necessary precautions the ego vehicle must take when moving through this shared space. No traffic lights, traffic signs, or vulnerable road users are present in this particular scene."

The presence of this vehicle on or near the roadway could indicate active construction work. For the ego vehicle, the construction vehicle may necessitate cautious driving, reduced speed, and an increased awareness of potential obstacles or workers on or near the roadway.

Also, adjustments to driving style should be made to account for the wet road conditions, such as allowing more distance for braking."
