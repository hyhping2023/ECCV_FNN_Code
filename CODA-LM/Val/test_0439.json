        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several vehicles that need to be considered:\n\n1. A red truck is traveling in the left lane in the same direction as the self-driving vehicle. Its large size and lane occupancy require maintaining a safe lateral distance, closely monitoring its movements, and adjusting speed or changing lanes as necessary.\n\n2. A large construction vehicle is in the middle lane ahead, surrounded by noticeable dust. Due to potential debris and reduced visibility, a safe following distance must be maintained. This vehicle is slow-moving, so speed adjustments or lane changes may be necessary.\n\n3. A small white car is in the right lane ahead, traveling in the same direction. The vehicle should monitor its speed and trajectory to ensure safe lane changes, avoiding sudden acceleration and safely overtaking.\n\n4. In the rightmost lane, a green tarp-covered truck is parallel to the self-driving vehicle. Ongoing monitoring of the truck's position is essential to prepare for possible lane changes. A safe distance must be kept, and lane position should be adjusted to ensure visibility and safety during overtaking.\n\n5. Several vehicles are on the far right lane, traveling in the same direction as the self-driving car. While they currently do not affect immediate driving decisions, their speed and trajectory changes should be monitored.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects impacting the current situation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the possibility of flying debris, please maintain a safe following distance from construction vehicles ahead and be aware of potential visibility reduction. Monitor the vehicles on both sides in case they suddenly change lanes, and adjust your speed accordingly to maintain a safe gap. Keep a lateral distance from the red truck on your left and watch for the white vehicle overtaking on your right to ensure it passes safely. Continuously monitor road conditions to detect any new road users or changes in road situations. Be prepared to change lanes at any time if construction vehicles or trucks affect your travel time or safety.",

            "description and explanation": "A sizable yellow construction vehicle is seen with an elevated dump bed, which could be an indication that it is actively depositing materials or is in an operational state. This type of vehicle is often associated with roadwork or construction and may imply the presence of a construction zone ahead. The future driving behavior of the ego car will need to be adjusted for possible reduced speed limits, changes in traffic patterns, or even detours due to the construction work. It is crucial to remain vigilant, keep a safe distance, and be prepared for unexpected stops or slowed traffic around this vehicle.",

Visibility indicators, like reflective checkered patterns, enhance its visibility for safety reasons. The future driving behavior for the ego car must include maintaining a safe following distance, being prepared for potential slow-downs or stops, and being cautious of any sudden maneuvers that the construction vehicle might make, especially during active work zones.",
