On the right side of the road, a car is parked perpendicular to our vehicle's direction, featuring a white rear and a blue base. This parked car is close to the driving lane, which could affect the flow of traffic and may require other road users to navigate around it. Further ahead, there are multiple cars with their taillights on, which could be moving away or stationary in the same direction of travel as our vehicle. The behavior of these vehicles will influence our speed and lane positioning, particularly if they slow down, stop, or change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist ahead on the right, moving in the same direction as our vehicle under the streetlight. The presence of the cyclist necessitates maintaining a safe distance and being ready for any sudden movements or stops. Near a construction site on the right, a person is standing with their back to the vehicle. Although they are not on the road, there is a possibility they might enter it, so they should be monitored closely.\n\nIn the distance, a traffic light is visible, displaying a red signal. This indicates that vehicles at the intersection must stop, and those approaching should prepare to stop as well.\n\nOn the right side, there is a yellow construction fence, signaling that there is a work zone ahead. This suggests that there may be road construction, which could alter traffic patterns and require the vehicle to slow down, stop, or follow detour signs.\n\nLastly, there is a construction site on the right, illuminated by bright lights, which seems to be set up for building materials or machinery. The construction site could lead to narrower lanes or unexpected obstacles, necessitating caution and potentially a lane change from our vehicle.\n\nThe traffic signs and traffic cones categories are empty, indicating that there are no such objects in the image that need to be considered."
