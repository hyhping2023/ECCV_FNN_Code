Furthermore, the vehicle should be prepared for the eventuality of a silver SUV re-entering the flow of traffic, maintain a safe following distance, and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if the SUV suddenly shifts lanes. The vehicle should also remain vigilant, paying attention to the dynamics of the vehicles ahead and to the left, in order to anticipate any abrupt turns or braking that may occur due to road conditions.",

In this scenario, it indicates that drivers should be aware of potential hazards ahead, such as road construction, maintenance, or unexpected road blockages. The presence of the traffic cone suggests that the ego car should proceed with caution, possibly reducing speed and being prepared to adjust its course to avoid the cone while staying within the limits of the traffic lane.",

Traffic cones are typically used to mark areas where driving is prohibited, to channel traffic, or to provide warning for hazards or road works ahead. In the context of this scene, the presence of the cone suggests there may be an obstruction or a designated no-drive area ahead on the road. The ego car will need to ensure it does not cross into this area, thereby maintaining a safe lane discipline and being aware of any potential redirection of traffic flow due to the cone's placement.",
