A sedan is visible in the center-right of the image, ahead of the ego car, with its rear lights illuminated, indicating it is either moving or braking. This vehicle’s actions will directly influence the driving decisions of the ego car as it is in its path. Another vehicle, a large white truck, is partially visible in the right lane, beside the ego car, with bright headlights on. The truck’s presence limits the ego car’s ability to change lanes to the right, and the glare from its headlights necessitates adjustments for potential decreased visibility.\n\nAdditionally, several orange traffic cones are lined up on the right-hand side of the road, between the ego car's lane and the truck's lane, indicating lane demarcation or road work. These cones suggest a reduction in lane width or a diversion, prompting the ego car to maintain its current lane and be cautious of the reduced space.\n\nLastly, temporary red and yellow road barriers are positioned to the left of the ego car, separating ongoing traffic from a closed lane or construction zone. These barriers indicate closed or restricted areas, requiring the ego car to remain in its lane and not attempt to cross them."

Drivers should notice the cone and prepare to slow down, move over to another lane if safe and possible, or follow other signs or signals that might accompany the cone.

Avoid lane changes to the right given the truck's presence and road narrowing due to traffic cones. The glare from the truck's headlights should be mitigated by the ego car's sensor adjustments. Continue to monitor the environment for any changes such as vehicles braking suddenly or further lane restrictions. Additionally, the ego car should not attempt to change lanes due to the barriers and should continue at a speed that allows for safe reaction to any sudden changes in the road conditions ahead. Adjust speed to account for the reflective road surface, indicating wet conditions, to avoid potential hydroplaning and to maintain control of the vehicle. Stay vigilant for construction signs or workers that could affect the driving path."
