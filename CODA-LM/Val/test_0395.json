This truck obstructs the clear route and poses a risk due to potential debris falling.\n   - A vehicle ahead in the same lane appears to be stopped with brake lights activated, suggesting possible traffic congestion that requires caution and readiness to stop.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - To the right, a cyclist is biking next to a parked car. The cyclist may need to avoid obstacles or parked vehicles, potentially entering the path of our vehicle.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Above the road on the right, a sign indicates the direction of lanes and points of interest, aiding in navigation without immediate impact on driving behavior.\n   - Additionally, an orange rectangular sign with Chinese characters is present on the right side of the road. While its content is incomprehensible due to language barriers, it seems informational and does not immediately affect driving behavior, though it should be noted for possible local regulations.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - Barriers on the right side delineate the pedestrian area and the road boundary. These guide traffic flow and limit the drivable road width.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n   - Roadside shops and buildings are recognized as potential areas where pedestrians might appear, though they do not directly affect driving behavior.\n\nThis summary provides a detailed understanding of the road environment and potential hazards that the autonomous vehicle needs to be aware of for safe navigation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a low speed and keep a safe distance from all trucks and stationary vehicles ahead. Watch out for motorcyclists on the right and give them ample space when overtaking. Be prepared to slow down or stop if trucks drop debris or brake due to vehicles ahead (including construction trucks that may be unloading). Follow the lane markings and be careful not to get too close to the barriers. In the absence of traffic lights, adhere to standard road rules and stay alert to any signals given by construction workers or pedestrians who may enter the road from storefront areas.",
