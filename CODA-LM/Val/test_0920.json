        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, we observe an array of road users and objects. Starting with vehicles, there's a silver sedan parked on the side of the road and behind it, the rear end of another vehicle is visible. Further down the road, a green bus is in motion, accompanied by other vehicles driving along. The parked vehicles may present challenges if they unexpectedly leave their parking spots, while the moving vehicles, notably the bus, could disrupt traffic flow by stopping to pick up passengers.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, we notice a cat crossing the road from right to left in front of a parked white vehicle on the side of the image. This situation requires vigilance, as the cat could wander into the ego vehicle's path, mandating caution to prevent a collision.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there are no signs in the image that directly influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior, so standard traffic rules are to be followed. Similarly, no traffic lights are visible, indicating the need to adhere to right-of-way rules and other traffic signs that might be present outside the image's field of view.\n\nRegarding traffic cones, they are distinctly arrayed on the road, marking off an area of the right lane near a parked white SUV. The visible red and white cones suggest a part of the lane is obstructed or reserved, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust its position slightly to the left, taking care to stay clear of any oncoming traffic.\n\nNo barriers that could impact the normal flow of traffic are present in the view, thereby ensuring the road structure remains unaltered and navigation is straightforward.\n\nLastly, concerning the category of other objects, there is a white vehicle parked on the side of the road, partially encroaching onto the footpath. This vehicle could potentially block the view of any pedestrians or road users attempting to cross, meaning extra attention should be paid to that area to preemptively identify any hazards."

Overtaking or passing should be done with caution, particularly because of the pedestrians that may emerge from behind the bus or other large vehicles."
