There is a car with its taillights illuminated on the right side of the ego car, appearing to be in motion, which may indicate it is either being overtaken or moving slower than the ego car. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance carefully. Additionally, there is a small, blurry figure on a bicycle nearby on the right side of the road. Due to low visibility and motion blur, this cyclist is difficult to see, meaning the ego car must drive cautiously and remain aware to prevent any potential collision. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."
