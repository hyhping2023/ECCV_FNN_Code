However, attention must be given to the presence of multiple birds, likely roosters, on the ground to the left of the driving path. These birds are unpredictable and may enter the roadway, which would affect the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle. Additionally, there are animals, presumably chickens, located near the entrance gate of a property adjacent to the road.
