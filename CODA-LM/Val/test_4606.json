The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this large vehicle due to its size and the potential for unpredictable movements, especially if it's associated with a construction site.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is visible in the distance, slightly to the left, which seems to apply to an adjacent lane rather than the one the ego car and cement mixer are in. This light must be monitored in case the ego vehicle needs to change lanes or if the mixer truck moves into that lane. Furthermore, there is another green traffic light ahead that indicates the traffic in the ego car's lane or the adjacent lane has the right of way to proceed. Despite the green light, the ego car should continue with caution because of the cement mixer truck's immediate presence.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, there are metal barriers dividing the road from the sidewalk and an adjacent construction or restricted area. These barriers suggest the presence of construction or road work that could affect traffic patterns and road availability. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

Be vigilant of any potential cues indicating the mixer may be trying to merge into the lane with the green light or if any construction signs are present. If the lane to the left is clear and it's legal to change lanes, the ego car may consider doing so to pass the truck if it is moving slowly or is stationary. Additionally, observe for any other road signs or signals that may become visible as the vehicle moves forward, which could affect driving decisions. The ego car should also watch for any construction signage or changes in traffic patterns due to the metal barriers on the side of the road."
