        "description and explanation": "The scene depicted in the traffic image includes several road users and items of interest that inform driving behavior. There are multiple construction vehicles parked on the side of the road, such as an excavator and a wheel loader. These vehicles are stationary and occupy part of the right side of the road, likely reducing the number of available lanes for traffic flow. In addition, a black sedan is parked on the left side of the road, facing the direction of the ego car. While it is not moving at the moment, it could become an obstacle if it decides to enter traffic. Ahead of the ego vehicle, a white sedan is traveling in the same direction; it is important for the ego car to keep a safe distance and be ready for any abrupt changes from this sedan, like sudden stops or changes in speed.\n\nConstruction workers are present near the construction vehicles. Their proximity to the roadway introduces a safety concern, as they might unexpectedly step onto the road, which requires the ego car to proceed with caution and potentially at a reduced speed.\n\nAlong the right side of the road leading to the construction zone, orange traffic cones are placed, indicating roadwork and possibly signaling that a lane is closed or that traffic should be rerouted.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, white and red temporary barriers run parallel to them on the right side of the road. These barriers define the construction area's limits and likely serve to channel vehicles away from the construction site, suggesting that cars may need to merge left to avoid the zone.\n\nThe dataset does not include any information about traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects, implying there are none in the traffic image that impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

The ego car should remain vigilant for any signs of movement from the construction workers or machinery that could affect the path of travel. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, and be prepared to navigate a narrowed driving lane. If possible, the ego car should move slightly to the left within its lane to maximize the distance from the construction zone on the right while still maintaining safe distance from oncoming traffic."
