        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are multiple objects and road users of interest. The scene includes two vehicles: an orange car that is oddly parked diagonally on the left side of the road facing oncoming traffic, which hints at a possible traffic incident or improper parking causing an obstruction. Alongside it, there is a white car parked close to the orange one, facing in the same direction, suggesting that it might also be part of the obstruction encountered on the road.\n\nThere are various vulnerable road users as well. Pedestrians are present on both sides of the road, requiring the autonomous vehicle to yield to them due to the potential safety hazards they pose. A motorcyclist is also observed traveling along the left edge of the road in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle; extra space and caution are required when navigating around the motorcyclist to ensure their safety. Adding to the complexity, an individual in a green high-visibility jacket is walking on the road towards the autonomous vehicle, which might indicate they are a traffic worker and could be providing directions that need to be followed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a temporary brick wall on the right side of the road, reducing its width and demanding careful navigation. This is accompanied by bricks piled up on the roadside, suggesting possible road construction activities. These materials are not blocking the autonomous vehicle's path but are potential distractions that require vigilant driving.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones detected in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the position of the orange vehicle and pedestrians crossing the road, self-driving vehicles should slow down and be prepared for possible evasive actions. Considering the potential for traffic accidents and increased pedestrian activity, it's advisable to remain vigilant and ready to stop at any time. When overtaking motorcyclists, self-driving vehicles should also proceed with caution, leaving them enough space. Overall, self-driving vehicles must drive carefully, observing any changes in the situation that may require an immediate response. Be ready to stop or yield to any road users who are crossing or entering the roadway. Since this seems to be a construction area or a place where there has recently been work, there may be temporary traffic directions or workers guiding vehicles; stay alert to these signs. Maintain a safe distance from open taxi doors and leave space for any passengers alighting.",
