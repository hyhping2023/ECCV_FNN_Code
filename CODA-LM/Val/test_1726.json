There is a white van parked on the right side of the road, partially occupying the lane. This van potentially narrows the usable space of the ego car's lane and requires careful maneuvering to avoid. While the van is stationary and not an immediate dynamic threat, its presence serves as an obstacle.\n\nAdditionally, to the left of the ego car, there are large cable spools bordered by a low wall or barrier. These static objects do not directly influence driving behavior since they are not on the roadway, but their proximity means the ego car should be aware in case any spools were to unexpectedly roll into the road.\n\nSmall amounts of debris are visible on the road surface near the spools of cable. This debris presents potential hazards that the ego car should be ready to avoid to prevent damage or loss of traction."

            "description and explanation": "This is an image showing large industrial cable spools stored on the side of the road. These sizable cylindrical items are typically used to store and transport various types of cable or wire. In a driving scenario, the presence of such objects close to the roadside may signal a temporary storage area or ongoing construction work nearby. The positioning of the spools suggests that they are not an immediate hazard to the vehicle; however, the driver should be cautious of potential obstacles or construction-related activity ahead that might affect the flow of traffic or necessitate a change in driving behavior, such as reduced speed or heightened awareness.",

Operate within the road's speed limits, and be ready to make evasive maneuvers if required. There are no traffic signs or signals to observe, so normal road rules apply."
