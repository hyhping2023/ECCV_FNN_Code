A white sedan is positioned on the right-hand side with its brake lights illuminated, which may indicate a potential stop or slow movement. This situation requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for a possible stop. Additionally, a large orange construction sign is visible ahead, indicating a construction zone on the left and suggesting a detour to the right, thereby necessitating a change in the ego car's path. The traffic light in the image is green, allowing traffic to proceed but requiring the ego car to adhere to the conditions indicated by the construction sign. Furthermore, blue and yellow striped barriers are present in the middle of the road, signaling that a section is blocked off for construction, which directs the ego car to navigate away from the construction area and adjust its driving path accordingly."

Observe the green traffic light but proceed with caution, particularly due to the construction signage and barriers which suggest upcoming road work. Reduce speed appropriately to handle potential hazards from the construction zone ahead. Proceed with caution, obeying the green light while preparing to merge or change lanes safely in response to the indicated construction ahead. Stay alert for any additional signage or signals related to the construction zone, and adjust speed as necessary. Maintain distance from the vehicle on the right to prevent any unsafe lateral maneuvers."
