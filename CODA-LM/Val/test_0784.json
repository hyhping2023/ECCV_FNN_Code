The presence of the parked car is not an immediate threat to the ego vehicle; however, it needs to be watched carefully in case someone opens the doors suddenly or if the vehicle starts to move unexpectedly. Additionally, a cat is spotted crossing the road from left to right, situated in the opposite lane but close to the center dividing line. Animals, such as this cat, are often unpredictable and capable of swift direction changes, which can create potential hazards on the road. Therefore, the ego vehicle must remain alert and prepared to either slow down or come to a stop to ensure the cat's safety and prevent a collision. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that need to be considered."
