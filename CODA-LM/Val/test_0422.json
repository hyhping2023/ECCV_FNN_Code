The sedan's position and movement are important as they may indicate the flow of traffic or upcoming maneuvers that our vehicle should be aware of.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a person wearing reflective yellow clothing standing near a set of blue barriers. This individual appears to be monitoring traffic or performing road work, suggesting that there may be construction ahead and signaling the need for our vehicle to slow down and exercise caution.\n\nAlong the right side of the road, multiple blue and white traffic cones are arranged, marking the boundaries of construction areas or closed parts of the road. These cones guide the traffic and could reduce the drivable space, affecting the path our vehicle can take.\n\nThere are blue barriers extending onto the sidewalk from a building structure on the right side of the road, indicating potential construction or obstructions that may require vehicles to merge left or reduce speed. Additionally, blue barriers on the central reservation serve to separate the opposing lanes of traffic, ensuring vehicles stay on the correct side and do not cross into oncoming traffic.\n\nLastly, the road surface is littered with various small fragments that appear as dark spots, posing a risk to the vehicle's traction and safety. The vehicle should maintain a safe speed and be ready to alter its driving path to avoid larger debris."

    "driving_suggestion": "Based on observations, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, preparing to decelerate or even stop. Pay attention to any movements of a stationary bus, such as re-entering the lane. The presence of roadworks and obstacles means the vehicle should reduce speed and prepare for course adjustments due to lane closures or construction. Remain vigilant and ready to adapt to changing road conditions, such as potential lane mergers or changes. Be mindful of pedestrians at the gas station, and prepare to stop or slow down if they move into the driving lane. Keep the vehicle within its lane, following the barriers on the right side. Considering the road is dry, maintain normal vigilance. Decelerate as needed to safely navigate around possible debris on the road. Continue to follow standard road safety measures, respecting obstacles and lane divisions.",
