On the right side of the road, a large white concrete mixer truck with its extended mixing drum part is partially blocking the lane ahead, posing a potential hazard by potentially restricting the mobility of both our vehicle and other traffic. Additionally, several cars are parked on the left side of the road, which narrows the road and necessitates that vehicles adjust their position or speed accordingly.\n\nVulnerable road users are represented by construction workers located near the construction railing on the left side of the road, who might be a potential hazard if they step into the traffic lanes, thus requiring drivers to exercise increased caution and possibly adhere to lower speed limits. There is also a group of construction workers in yellow safety helmets gathered on the right side, behind the traffic cones at a construction site; their proximity to the road requires autonomous vehicles to slow down and be alert, ready to respond to any unforeseen movements into the road.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there is a \"No Parking\" sign visible on the left side of the road, warning drivers of the parking restrictions and the need to keep traffic lanes clear to avoid violations.\n\nYellow and black traffic cones on the left side indicate ongoing construction work, serving as markers that may suggest lane alterations or closures, thus necessitating careful navigation by drivers around the affected zone.\n\nLastly, red plastic barriers are erected around the construction area on the right, causing lane narrowing and possibly indicating lane closures or detours. These barriers signal that the normal flow of traffic has been altered, requiring drivers to reduce speed, drive with caution, and be ready to stop or follow detour signs as needed.\n\nThe traffic lights and other objects categories contain no items, suggesting that there are no traffic lights or other notable objects affecting the traffic in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to construction personnel and narrowed lanes, our vehicle should reduce speed and maintain a safe distance from the concrete mixer truck obstructing the right lane, always ready to make an emergency stop or yield due to the black car pulling out from the parking spot. Follow the guidance of traffic cones and obstacles to safely pass through the construction area. Moreover, our vehicle should stay alert to the potential actions of the yellow vehicle ahead. The identified traffic cones and obstacles indicate that due to obstruction, vehicles should not attempt to move to the right lane. Therefore, maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to react to the concrete mixer truck's movements is crucial. Our vehicle should also not consider parking near the \"No Parking\" sign area to comply with traffic regulations and reduce speed due to wet road conditions.",
