        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles to be aware of:\n\nFirstly, there is a concrete mixer truck ahead in the left lane, which is identifiable by its rotating drum and is moving in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle (ego car). Due to its size and the potential for construction vehicles to make unexpected maneuvers or drop debris, it is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck.\n\nSecondly, a blue SUV is noticed in the right lane ahead of the ego car. Its brake lights are off, suggesting it is moving steadily. The ego car needs to monitor the blue SUV in case it decides to change lanes or adjust its speed suddenly, ensuring safe driving conditions.\n\nLastly, there is a stationary dark-colored SUV parked on the side of the road on the right, close to the curb, and it is facing the same direction as the ego car. Since the vehicle is stationary and parked, it must be considered in the event the vehicle begins to move or if its doors open unexpectedly, which could pose risks to the ego car's path.\n\nThere are no other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this image. Therefore, the ego car's driving behavior should be influenced exclusively by the noted vehicles."

            "description and explanation": "A large vehicle typically used in construction is present. This vehicle may be transporting materials such as cement, often used for mixing concrete on construction sites. In terms of driving behavior, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for the longer stopping distance of heavy vehicles, and be prepared for potential debris or material falling from the vehicle. Additionally, the ego car driver should be cautious of the vehicle's wide turns and be ready to adjust speed or lane position accordingly.",

Monitor the SUV's behavior for any sudden changes in speed or lane changes, and prepare to adjust speed accordingly. Remain alert as the visibility ahead might be compromised by the size of the truck in the left lane. Be prepared for potential changes in the vehicle's movement or behavior. Additionally, keep an eye on the parked SUV as you pass by, ensuring it remains stationary and that no passengers exit the vehicle unexpectedly into the roadway. Continue monitoring the road conditions and other road users for changes that could affect driving behavior. Stay in the lane with the most visibility and space unless overtaking is necessary and safe to do."
