This caravan is an immediate obstacle for the ego vehicle, suggesting that it is either moving slowly or is stationary, and therefore requires careful navigation by the autonomous system to avoid a collision or to safely pass.\n\nAdditionally, there is a partial view of a car on the left side, which may suggest that the road has multiple lanes and that there is other traffic present. The existence of this vehicle in an adjacent lane is an important factor for the autonomous driving system to consider, as it can affect decisions related to lane changes and necessitates heightened awareness of the surrounding traffic conditions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
