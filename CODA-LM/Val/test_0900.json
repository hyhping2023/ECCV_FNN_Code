These cars indicate traffic that the ego car must navigate while maintaining a safe distance and monitoring for any lateral movements that might affect lane changes.\n\nIn the top right corner, a traffic light is visible, displaying a red light with a countdown timer indicating '1' second remaining before changing. This signals that all vehicles, including the ego car, must stop. The countdown suggests preparing for a green light, but the ego car must remain stationary until it is legal and safe to proceed.\n\nA raised curb or island is present to the right of the ego car, separating the roadway from the pedestrian zone and adjacent lanes.

The driver should prepare to proceed with caution once the light turns green, paying close attention to the cement mixer truck in front which might move unpredictably or obstruct the view. Maintaining a safe following distance from the truck and being vigilant for pedestrians due to the nearby crossing would be advisable as the vehicle begins to move forward. Additionally, be aware of the traffic in the adjacent lanes for any unexpected lane changes. Prepare to proceed when the traffic light turns green, but only after ensuring that the way is clear and it is safe to do so. Proceed with caution towards the intersection while preparing to come to a complete stop as indicated by the traffic signal. Maintain a safe distance from the concrete mixer truck and monitor the surrounding vehicles for any sudden lane changes or stopping behaviors, especially as the signal is about to change. Do not proceed until the traffic light turns green. Be vigilant for pedestrians who may be entering or exiting the crosswalk as the signal changes."
