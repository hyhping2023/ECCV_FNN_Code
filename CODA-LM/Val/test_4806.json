Firstly, there is a large orange construction vehicle parked on the left side of the road, which is partially obstructing the lane. This vehicle has reduced the available road width, potentially affecting the passage of self-driving cars and other large vehicles. Additionally, a dark-colored sedan is also parked on the left side of the road. While it is stationary and does not immediately affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, it does reduce the available road width and requires attention.\n\nFurthermore, there is a person on a bicycle up ahead on the left, heading in the opposite direction of the autonomous vehicle. It is important when driving to give cyclists adequate space because they are considered vulnerable road users.\n\nLastly, there are several blue trash bins located on the right side of the road. These bins are off the road and do not obstruct the current driving route. However, it is important to remain vigilant and pay attention to them in case they move or spill onto the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Slow down to ensure a safe distance when bypassing parked construction vehicles and cyclists. Be prepared to respond to sudden movements from motorcyclists and other road users who may not be visible in the scene. Continue to monitor the road ahead for any traffic signs or changes in road conditions, and adjust your driving behavior accordingly. Drive carefully, maintaining a safe distance from parked construction vehicles and cars, ensuring to slow down to have enough reaction time in case construction vehicles start moving or any unexpected objects suddenly appear on the road. Pay attention to any changes in speed or direction of motorcyclists, and be ready to give way when necessary. The vehicle should also be vigilant for any activity around parked vehicles and garbage containers to avoid any accidental obstacles or pedestrians.",
