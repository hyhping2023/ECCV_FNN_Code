        "description and explanation": "The traffic image shows a large commercial vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, directly in front of the ego car. This truck is occupying the same lane and traveling in the same direction. Due to its substantial size, it obstructs the ego car's view of road conditions and traffic ahead. Consequently, maintaining a safe following distance and being ready to respond to the truck's sudden stops or turns is essential. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects visible in this image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle typically used for heavy-duty tasks such as excavation, transportation of construction materials, or other construction-related activities. Its size and function often cause it to move more slowly compared to typical passenger cars. Given its slower speed and potential to make sudden stops or perform unexpected maneuvers, it is crucial for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for changes in the construction vehicle's movements. It's also important to be vigilant for potential roadwork or construction zones ahead, which may require reduced speed or changes in traffic patterns.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck to ensure adequate time for reaction to any unforeseen maneuvers it may make, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to keep a clear line of sight ahead. Since the visibility of the road ahead is compromised by the truck's size, the ego car should also be attentive to any brake lights or indicators from the truck which may signal an upcoming turn or stop. Overtaking should only be considered if the opposite lane is clearly visible and free of oncoming traffic, and it is legal and safe to do so. If visibility or road conditions change, adjust speed and following distance accordingly."
