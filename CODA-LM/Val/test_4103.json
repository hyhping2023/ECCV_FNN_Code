However, there is a traffic light visible in the top-center portion of the image, which is showing a green light. This indicates that vehicles, including the ego car, can proceed through the intersection or area, as they have the right of way.\n\nAdditionally, there are yellow and black striped traffic cones arranged in a line extending from the right side to the center of the road, signaling a merge to the left. These cones suggest that there is lane closure or roadwork ahead, and as a result, the ego car must merge left and proceed with caution.\n\nA yellow and black striped barrier is also present on the right side of the road, funneling traffic to the left. This barrier indicates that there is a road obstruction or detour, and vehicles are required to follow the guided path.\n\nOther objects in the scene include sandbags piled against the barrier on the right side of the road. These sandbags are likely part of the traffic control measures to reinforce the barrier and should not directly impact the ego car's path. There is also an illuminated advertisement board on the right side of the road. While it does not affect the driving path, its brightness could potentially be distracting to drivers under certain conditions."

Sandbags are commonly used for flood control or as temporary ballasts, but in this context, they could also signify ongoing construction work or the need to prevent vehicles from getting too close to the edge of the road. The presence of sandbags could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by indicating that caution should be exercised, potentially leading to reduced speed and increased alertness while passing the area.",

This barrier will influence the driver of the ego car to stay in the open lane and be aware that there may be a change in road conditions ahead, such as a lane reduction or detour. As a result, the driver should prepare to slow down, merge left if necessary, and follow any additional signage related to the barrier.",

The ego car should follow the direction indicated by the traffic cones by merging to the left to avoid the section of the road that is closed or undergoing maintenance."
