        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a black vehicle ahead on the same road. Its taillights are on, suggesting the car might be in motion or stationary. This necessitates that the autonomous vehicle adjusts its driving style, specifically its speed and following distance, to ensure a safe buffer distance is maintained behind the black vehicle. Additionally, on the right side of the road, a pedestrian with a dog is observed walking close to the driving lane. This situation requires careful monitoring by the self-driving car as there is a potential safety risk if the pedestrian or the animal suddenly enters the driving path of the vehicle. For traffic regulations, a No Parking sign is posted on the right side of the road, clearly informing that no stopping or parking is allowed on that stretch, which assists the autonomous vehicle to comply with local traffic rules and helps maintain the flow of traffic. No traffic lights, cones, barriers, or other objects are noted in this scene."

Pay close attention to the movements of pedestrians and dogs, as they may enter the driving lane, especially when they intend to cross the road, be prepared to stop. Observe the wet and slippery road conditions, and reduce speed when approaching speed bumps to prevent losing control and comfortably pass the speed bumps. Continue driving as instructed by the No Parking signs, and do not stop at the side of the road. Stay alert and be prepared to take evasive action if necessary. Do not stop or park your vehicle at the No Parking signs. Continue to drive according to the lane markings, staying in the correct lane.",
