These parked vehicles present a potential hazard for the autonomous vehicle as they may unexpectedly enter the flow of traffic. This situation requires the oncoming vehicles, including the autonomous vehicle in question, to exercise increased caution and maintain heightened vigilance to avoid potential obstacles and ensure safe driving. The scene does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that merit attention."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the yellow crane truck on the left, as it may limit the maneuverability of this vehicle. Due to the possibility of reduced lane width caused by vehicles parked on the right and potentially wet road surfaces, driving should be slowed down. Keep a close watch on these parked vehicles in case they suddenly move, such as doors opening or pedestrians appearing. In the absence of traffic signals or signs, this vehicle should continue to follow the flow of traffic, while remaining alert to the surrounding dynamic environment and always ready to respond to unforeseen obstacles or changes in driving behaviors.",

Due to the size and nature of the bus, it may make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers. The ego car driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to slow down or stop if the bus indicates an intention to halt at a bus stop. Additionally, the bus might obscure the ego car driver's view of pedestrians and other vehicles merging from the right, so extra caution is warranted.",

It is a specialized vehicle equipped with a crane designed for lifting heavy materials and is often seen at construction sites or during roadworks. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road means that the ego car may need to exercise caution and possibly reduce speed to maintain safety. Construction activity could also result in temporary traffic flow changes or lane closures, requiring the ego car to pay attention to road signs and signals indicating detours or merging traffic.",
