This sedan could change lanes or accelerate, necessitating our vehicle to maintain a safe distance and readiness for possible evasive actions. Additionally, several vehicles are parked alongside the road next to a green barrier opposite the intersection. While these parked vehicles are not currently a direct concern, they indicate a potential activity area where other vehicles might emerge or passengers may get out.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: Two cyclists are on the right side of the vehicle, near the white sedan. These cyclists pose a potential risk as they may suddenly enter the driving lane, requiring the autonomous vehicle to keep a safe passing distance.\n\n- **Barriers**: A green barrier is present on the left side of the road next to the sidewalk, separating an area from the street. Such obstacles can narrow the drivable road, indicate ongoing construction or nearby closed areas. This necessitates the vehicle to stay in its lane and be alert to potential changes in traffic patterns."

    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should maintain its lane and keep a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, being mindful of any lane changes or speed adjustments. As it approaches the intersection, if the silver SUV begins to move, the lead vehicle should be prepared to stop or yield. Additionally, take extra care when overtaking cyclists, slowing down if necessary and maintaining a safe distance to ensure the safety of vulnerable road users. The lead vehicle should also pay attention to the overall traffic flow and any traffic signals that may be present at the intersection. Exercise caution when nearing the intersection, yielding to oncoming traffic, and be ready for pedestrians who may cross the road. Stay alert for the possibility of vehicle doors opening suddenly or people emerging from behind parked cars at the roadside.",
