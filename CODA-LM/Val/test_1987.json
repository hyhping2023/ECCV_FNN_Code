This construction vehicle may not match the normal traffic pace and could make unpredictable moves, requiring our car to keep a safe distance to adjust accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, temporary construction barriers are installed on the left side of the road. It's likely that these barriers signify there is ongoing roadwork, which could mean either potential hazards are present or there might be a narrower path to navigate through. The autonomous vehicle should stay alert for any sudden changes in road conditions and be prepared to obey possible directions from road workers."

Additionally, always be alert for construction workers or equipment that may appear due to roadblocks on the left side. Maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicles ahead, be ready to respond to potential lane narrowing or merging caused by construction roadblocks, and continue through the intersection when the traffic light is green. Drive cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the construction vehicles on the right, and be prepared to stop or detour when the vehicles move. Furthermore, slow down when approaching the intersection and be ready to stop or proceed depending on the traffic light status.",

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle is a type of heavy machinery typically used for construction tasks, such as earthmoving, lifting, and material handling. It appears to be stationary or moving slowly, likely carrying out construction-related activities. Its presence on or near the road could mean that there may be construction work underway, which can affect the driving behavior of the ego car. The ego car may need to reduce speed, watch for construction signs, workers, and additional equipment in the vicinity, and be prepared for possible lane closures or detours associated with the ongoing construction work.",
