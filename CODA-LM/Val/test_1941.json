        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are two notable categories of road users which include a vehicle and traffic lights, with no presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects.\n\nThe vehicle in the image is a white SUV positioned directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights illuminated. This suggests that the SUV is either slowing down or coming to a complete stop. This behavior of the SUV directly impacts the driving behavior of the ego car, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance and the need to be prepared to stop, should the SUV remain stationary or if the traffic conditions ahead require a stop.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light that would provide further guidance on how to proceed is not visible in the image. This lack of visibility means the state of the traffic light cannot be assessed from this perspective, posing a situation where the ego car must proceed with caution. The ego car's behavior, therefore, should be based on other visible cues, such as the illuminated brake lights of the vehicle ahead, until the state of the traffic light can be determined."
