The first truck is directly in front of the ego vehicle, which partially obscures the view of the second truck further ahead. The presence of these heavy and slower-moving vehicles is significant as it could influence the driving behavior of the ego car. This influence is due to several factors associated with such vehicles: their large size, the potential for debris fall-off from the trucks, and the possibility of sudden stops or a reduction in speed, which necessitates increased caution and attention from the ego car's driver."

It is characterized by a rotating drum used to mix cement and is typically larger and heavier than regular vehicles. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, it is pertinent to maintain a safe following distance due to the construction vehicle's size and potential for dropping debris. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops associated with construction activities.",

The rotating drum indicates it is transporting wet cement to prevent it from solidifying. Due to its size and the nature of its cargo, the vehicle may move slower than others and may take wider turns, especially at intersections. Drivers behind this type of vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow-downs as the truck maneuvers through the traffic or towards a construction site.",

Consider the size and cargo of these trucks, which could potentially drop debris on the road, requiring the ego car to maneuver safely. Continuous monitoring of the vehicles' indicators or brake lights is advised, in case the trucks signal to make a turn or change in driving pattern."
