        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image analyzed, there are multiple road users and signals which the self-driving vehicle must take into account. There are three vehicles present:\n\n1. A blue sedan is traveling in the left lane, parallel to the autonomous vehicle. The presence of this sedan impacts the ability to change lanes or adjust speed for maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle.\n\n2. A large red truck is positioned on the right side, moving perpendicularly on a further right lane relative to the main vehicle. The truck's size and position might obstruct the driver's view when attempting to navigate traffic or planning a lane change.\n\n3. There is a white box truck facing perpendicular to the self-driving vehicle, slightly to the right of the centerline. It may be parked or stopped. This truck could block the view of the autonomous car and, should it start moving unexpectedly, it might become a sudden obstacle.\n\nIn addition to these vehicles, the image includes a traffic light:\n\n- The traffic light ahead displays a red signal. For autonomous cars, this means that they must come to a complete stop at the intersection, obey traffic laws, and ensure safety for all road users.\n\nThe data provided does not mention any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, which implies that these elements are either not present or not relevant to the driving scenario captured in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, be prepared to stop at the red light, and avoid any sudden lane changes that might bring it too close to the blue sedan on the left or the red truck and white utility vehicle on the right. Additionally, the driver should pay attention to the traffic cones in the center of the intersection and follow them to stay on the correct driving path. The vehicle should also monitor any movements of the white van and the cargo truck, as they could obstruct the road when traffic starts moving again. There is no immediate need to change lanes unless the planned route or road conditions ahead require it. It is advisable to drive cautiously when approaching traffic cones to ensure safe navigation around potential obstacles or construction areas.",
