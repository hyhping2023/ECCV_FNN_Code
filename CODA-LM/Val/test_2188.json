This parked van may restrict the available road space for the ego vehicle, potentially requiring a lane change to pass safely. On the right side, several pedestrians are visible on the pedestrian walkway, either standing or sitting near outdoor stalls or bus stop shelters. While they are not currently on the road, it is crucial for the autonomous vehicle to monitor them closely due to their proximity, as they might accidentally enter the road. Additionally, roadside market stalls are located near the driving lane on the right side. These stalls are likely to attract pedestrian traffic, necessitating extra vigilance from the ego vehicle to anticipate increased pedestrian activity near the road."

If the lane is too narrow to safely pass a parked van, drivers should signal and merge into an adjacent lane when it is safe to do so. Drivers should always be prepared to respond to pedestrians who may suddenly enter the street; therefore, in this mixed activity area, maintaining a lower speed and a higher level of alertness is advisable. Be prepared to deal with potential pedestrian crossings and vehicles entering the road from the right. Given that market stalls are nearby and may block the view, it is necessary to slow down to ensure safety when required.",
