The truck fully occupies its lane and appears to be traveling at a consistent speed with the flow of traffic. Due to its presence, our vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for any sudden movements or changes in the truck's speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of high-visibility traffic cones placed on the right side of the road. These cones signal a work zone or a lane closure, and as a consequence, vehicles in the right lane are required to merge to the left.\n\nFurthermore, along with the traffic cones, there are yellow and red striped barriers positioned in a line. These barriers are placed to provide a sturdy blockade to ensure that vehicles do not enter the closed-off area which could contain road workers or other hazards hidden from the driver's view. Their presence reinforces the instruction for our vehicle to continue traveling in the left lane to avoid the work zone.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or objects are mentioned in the data for this image."

It is usually brightly colored for high visibility and is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily guide traffic in a safe manner. The presence of a traffic cone can indicate construction work, an accident ahead, or other temporary road condition changes that require the driver's attention.

Barriers are often installed as a measure to prevent vehicles from entering dangerous or restricted areas, or to channel traffic in a particular direction, especially around construction sites or when lanes are closed for maintenance. In this scenario, the barrier indicates that the ego car should stay in the open lane and be aware that there might be changes to normal traffic flow or workers and machinery nearby, thus requiring the driver to maintain a vigilant watch and adjust speed accordingly.",
