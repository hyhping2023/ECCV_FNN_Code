This suggests that traffic is not currently moving forward, directly influencing the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and prepare to stop if it hasn't already. Additionally, an orange excavator is positioned to the right of the white van, partly on the road and partly off-road, indicative of potential road work or an obstacle. This means possible traffic delays and requires the ego vehicle to be cautious and ready to follow any directions or signs related to construction or road work.\n\nThe red triangular lights atop the white van are lit, implying the vehicle may be stopped due to a hazard or that it is part of a construction or utility fleet. These illuminated lights signal the need for attention and caution, prompting the ego vehicle to prepare for stops or slow traffic.\n\nOn the left side, red and white barriers indicate a closed or restricted lane, alongside a covered object resembling a heap next to the barriers. This lane closure or restriction suggests reduced road capacity, necessitating that the ego vehicle stays in the open lane while being attentive to any required rerouting."

It should also be ready to stop or reduce speed due to the red lights on the van and remain within the open lane, avoiding any closed lanes indicated by the barriers. Due to potential reduced traction on the disturbed road surface, the ego car should reduce speed accordingly to maintain safe handling of the vehicle. Prepare to slow down or stop if the traffic situation requires it; if safe and legal to do so, consider changing lanes to the left to avoid the stopped van and the construction area indicated by the excavator's presence. Maintain increased following distance due to wet road conditions."
