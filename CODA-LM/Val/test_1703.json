This impacts the maneuverability of our vehicle and suggests nearby construction activities that might affect traffic flow.\n   - A sedan is stopped ahead of our car, preparing to pass through the toll station. Its position in the toll lane indicates it is either moving slowly or is stationary, necessitating that our vehicle maintains a safe distance and be ready to stop or proceed at a low speed.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - The electronic toll collection (ETC) sign above the road reads \"ETC Lane,\" indicating a lane designated specifically for vehicles equipped with an electronic toll system. This sign helps drivers identify the correct toll lane for ETC-equipped vehicles.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - A concrete barrier on the right side of the construction vehicle is partially visible, suggesting lane restriction or ongoing road construction. These obstacles reduce the navigable road space and indicate a construction zone, requiring reduced speed and increased caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or additional other objects present in the image."

Adjust speed according to construction signs and current road conditions. Additionally, our vehicle should remain vigilant for potential sudden stops or merging from vehicles entering the toll system.",

The presence of this ETC gantry implies that the ego car is approaching a toll-collection point and must ensure that it has the appropriate ETC system enabled for automatic toll payment, or it should prepare to stop for manual toll payment if an ETC is not in use.",
