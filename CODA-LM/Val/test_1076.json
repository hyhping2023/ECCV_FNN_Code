Its brake lights are on, suggesting that the truck is slowing down or stopped. This requires the autonomous car to be ready to decelerate or come to a halt. On the left, there's a white bus, partially in view, which could be in a different lane or at a bus stop. The bus might affect the traffic if it merges into the lane or if passengers are getting on and off.\n\nA pedestrian is observed on the right side of the road, close to guardrails, and this could pose a risk if the pedestrian decides to enter the road, necessitating the car to possibly stop or slow down.\n\nFurthermore, there's a red traffic light displayed above the road on the right, signaling that the vehicle should stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, metal guardrails are present along the right-hand side of the road. They outline the edge of the drivable lane and restrict the car's ability to move off the road, ensuring the vehicle stays on the road."

Be prepared to stop or yield to the pedestrian on the right if they show any signs of crossing the road. Since there is a red light, the ego car should come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding."
