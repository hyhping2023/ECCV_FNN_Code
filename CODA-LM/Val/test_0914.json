This parked vehicle suggests a temporary obstruction on the road's side and potential workers nearby, necessitating caution from the ego car and possibly a lane change to maintain a safe distance.\n\nOrange traffic cones are arranged diagonally across the lane, signaling a lane closure ahead. These cones direct the ego vehicle to change lanes due to an obstruction or road work operation in progress.\n\nAn elevated platform, likely part of the cherry picker setup, is positioned over a section of the road for road work activities. This cherry picker represents a temporary obstruction, indicating ongoing maintenance or construction work.\n\nA cherry picker with its boom extended under an overpass, equipped with lights, is placed behind the traffic cones, showing active work being performed. This equipment's presence further suggests the potential for temporary obstructions and workers on the road."
