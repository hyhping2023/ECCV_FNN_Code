Also, due to potential debris falling from the mixer, maintaining a safe distance is advised."

        "description and explanation": "In the visual scene presented, the ego vehicle is situated behind a large construction vehicle identified as a cement mixer, which is occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The cement mixer's prominent cylindrical mixing drum suggests its identity, and its operational rear lights indicate that it is active. Due to the bulky nature and operational status of the mixer, it is likely traveling slower than smaller vehicles, limiting maneuvering options such as overtaking for the ego vehicle. Keeping a sufficient distance is also recommended to avoid any potential debris fall-off from the mixer.\n\nAdditionally, to the right side of the ego vehicle, a line of vehicles is either stationary or advancing slowly, which could be indicative of a traffic jam or a stoppage due to a traffic signal ahead. This stationary traffic on the right restricts the ego vehicle from changing lanes to that side.\n\nAbove the traffic, an electronic sign board visible yet not clearly legible could be carrying crucial information about upcoming road conditions or directives, which may need attentiveness from the ego vehicle for compliance and safety.\n\nMarked by bright orange, traffic cones are placed by the left barrier suggesting a no-cross zone and serve as a guide for the vehicles, directing the traffic and restricting the ego vehicleâ€™s lane-changing actions towards the left.\n\nFurthermore, red and white temporary barriers have been installed on the left side of the lane where the ego vehicle and the cement mixer are present. These barriers signify potential traffic obstructions, such as a construction site or lane merges, cueing the ego vehicle to remain vigilant and possibly prepare for narrowed lanes or obstacles ahead.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects are reported in the image under consideration."

Due to the presence of barriers and traffic cones, lane changes to the left should be avoided unless directed by road signs. The ego vehicle should stay alert for any road work notifications or change in traffic patterns. Given the presence of the concrete mixer truck directly ahead and the traffic cones indicating lane restrictions to the right side, prepare to adjust speed accordingly, and not attempt to overtake at this time. It is also advisable to continuously monitor the traffic situation for changes that might allow for a safe lane change or overtaking maneuver when the traffic cones end and it's safe to do so. Stay alert for any traffic signs or signals that may come into view and adjust driving behavior accordingly."
