        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a dark sedan on the far right lane just ahead of our car, which requires maintaining a safe following distance. Additionally, a light green car is observed on the left side, driving through an intersection, suggesting that the traffic light might be green and indicating the flow of traffic. This car's movement also informs us about the potential turning maneuvers. On the opposite side, a white car in the left lane is approaching an intersection and appears to be slowing down or preparing to stop, which could signal changes in traffic signals or the presence of road obstacles.\n\nThe traffic infrastructure includes a sign on the ceiling that provides lane direction and possible turns, essential for making correct lane choices. There is also a traffic light above the intersection that is currently green, indicating that if it remains so and conditions are safe, the autonomous vehicle should proceed.\n\nOn the right side of the pedestrian crossing, orange traffic cones are placed, signaling potential road construction or hazards, even though they are not directly in the vehicle's path. They serve as a reminder to stay vigilant and may suggest a lane closure or obstacle ahead.\n\nLastly, in the background, there is equipment on the right side of the road, indicating ongoing construction or maintenance activities. While not directly on the road, this situation necessitates caution regarding potential obstacles that may arise."

    "driving_suggestion": "Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front, carefully prepare to pass through the intersection, and observe the movements of surrounding vehicles. Stay alert, pay attention to the changes in traffic lights, and be ready for any adjustments indicated by traffic cones or road workers. Monitor the traffic lights to decide the appropriate action (proceed, slow down, or stop). Maintain a safe distance from the car ahead, be ready to stop if the car in front halts, and observe the intentions of the white vehicle and the turning green vehicle. Be cautious of workers on the right and traffic cones indicating potential lane closures. If the traffic light is green and the intersection is clear, consider the lane direction, proceed carefully, and be prepared to change lanes in advance, continuing to your destination.",
