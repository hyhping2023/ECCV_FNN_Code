This truck could obstruct the driving path and reduce the available lane width for the ego car, potentially obscuring the view of traffic and other hazards on the left side. Ahead of the ego car, in the same lane, there are several vehicles all moving in the same direction with their tail lights on, indicating slow-moving or stopped traffic ahead. This situation will influence the ego car's speed and stopping distance, necessitating a potential reduction in speed or a complete stop.\n\nThere are no visible vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the scene, so no immediate action is required in this regard, although vigilance is always necessary. Similarly, no traffic signs are clearly identifiable from the current angle and lighting conditions, so no specific actions are needed, but the ego car should stay alert for any upcoming signs.\n\nTraffic lights are visible in the distance, showing green over the lane the ego vehicle is in, indicating that vehicles in this lane have the right of way to proceed if road conditions allow. However, since the traffic light state for the ego vehicle's direction is not visible, the ego car should be prepared to react to potential changes in the light and observe traffic behavior for indications of such changes.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right side, creating a barrier between the driving lane and a construction or off-road area, indicating that part of the road or shoulder is likely under construction. This requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the cones to prevent collision and to be ready to merge left if the lane narrows further ahead. Additionally, there is a barrier visible on the right side of the road, alongside the traffic cones, which indicates a demarcation for a construction or work area, reinforcing the need for the ego car to stay in its current lane.\n\nNo other objects are reported in the scene."

Additionally, caution should be used to avoid the truck's protrusion into the ego car's lane. With the green traffic light in the distance, the ego car may proceed, but with heightened vigilance and readiness to react to changes. The ego car's best course of action is to maintain a safe following distance behind the traffic ahead, prepare to stop if necessary, and stay alert for any changes in the traffic flow or road conditions. The ego car should not attempt to change lanes due to the truck's presence and the traffic cones and barrier on the right that indicate a work area and reduced lane width. The driver should also keep an eye out for any traffic signs and signals that may come into view and dictate a change in driving behavior."
