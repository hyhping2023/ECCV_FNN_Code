                "explanation": "The volume of concrete mixers may obstruct visibility, and their width could limit the space in the lane of the vehicle itself. Since there might be debris falling off the mixer or the mixer might suddenly stop, maintaining a safe distance is important."

                "explanation": "This vehicle currently does not directly affect our driving route, but it might have an impact if lanes merge or if we need to change lanes. This vehicle determines the driving speed of our lane, so it's necessary to pay attention and observe whether it will suddenly brake or turn."

Stationary buses can lead to pedestrians suddenly stepping out or other vehicles detouring, necessitating cautious driving by self-driving cars."

        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, multiple vehicles are present, each affecting driving behavior in different ways. An orange concrete mixer truck occupies the lane ahead, traveling in the same direction as our car. The truck's size could obscure the view ahead, and debris could fall off. Caution is advised as the truck may stop unexpectedly, necessitating maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nTo the left, there's a white sedan at a standstill in the left-turn lane, waiting for the green signal. While not directly in our path, it influences the traffic flow and could impact driving if the lanes converge or require a lane change. Monitoring this vehicle is critical as it may brake or initiate a turn unexpectedly.\n\nIn the right lane adjacent to ours, a bus is moving away from our position. Since buses are prone to stop often, this could disrupt traffic and force self-driving vehicles to adapt by decelerating or changing lanes. Also, stationary buses increase the risk of pedestrians crossing unexpectedly and can cause other vehicles to navigate around them, requiring vigilance.\n\nA gray sedan is placed to our right in the neighboring lane, slightly ahead of our position. Keeping an eye on this vehicle is paramount due to the potential of it merging into our lane or in case our car needs to merge into theirs.\n\nAlthough not an immediate concern, there's a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction, far left in its lane. Observing oncoming traffic remains an important aspect of overall situational awareness.\n\nRegarding traffic control devices, the traffic light visible in this scene displays a green light for this lane, indicating that our vehicle can proceed. Nevertheless, readiness to respond to signal changes or unexpected vehicular movements is always required.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concrete barrier situated between the lanes of opposing traffic. The purpose of this barrier is to enhance vehicle safety by segregating traffic flows in different directions, thereby helping to avert potential side-on collisions.\n\nThe image does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects that would require attention or alter the driving pattern of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the bus ahead on the right, and be aware that the bus may stop. Watch out for the concrete mixer truck ahead, as its large size may obstruct your view, and it might occupy more lanes. If you need to change lanes, make sure you have enough space. Keep a close eye on traffic light changes, and be vigilant for vehicles in the adjacent lane that might merge into your lane. Continue to drive cautiously at the current speed, observing traffic rules and signals. Keep a safe distance from the concrete mixer truck in front of you, carefully observing its position, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Be alert to sudden movements from the bus and SUVs, and be prepared for the possibility of pedestrians around the bus. Maintain a safe following distance behind the white sedan, and be ready to respond to potential stops or slowdowns due to the large cement mixer ahead. Monitor the bus ahead for possible stops, and pay attention to any changes in the green traffic light. Additionally, keep an eye on oncoming traffic to stay fully alert. Unless traffic dynamics change significantly (such as the traffic light turning yellow or the bus stopping suddenly), there's no need to change lanes or adjust speed immediately. Continue to adhere to standard road safety precautions and anticipate the actions of nearby large vehicles.",
