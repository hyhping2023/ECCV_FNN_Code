        "description and explanation": "In the given traffic image, there is notable activity among several categories of road users. \n\nFirstly, two vehicles are observed: \n1. A yellow vehicle, likely a taxi, located on the right side of the image and moving perpendicular to our car. This vehicle's trajectory may affect our vehicle's lane-changing or acceleration decisions.\n2. Several vehicles are seen behind a checkpoint, not directly in our vehicle's path but still pertinent to monitor in case of changes in traffic flow.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a group of pedestrians is gathered in a sheltered area on the left sidewalk. They are currently stationary and away from the roadway, but our vehicle should keep an eye on them in case they abruptly decide to cross the road.\n\nMultiple traffic cones are present in the foreground, marking the boundaries of the lanes. These cones define the drivable area and suggest a construction zone or detour, prompting our vehicle to stay within the designated lanes.\n\nOn the left side of the roadway, metal railings delineate construction or restricted areas, limiting driving space and necessitating a safe distance to prevent collisions.\n\nLastly, a bright light source, possibly a streetlight, appears at the top of the picture. This light causes glare on the camera sensor, underscoring the need to depend on other sensors for reliable environmental perception."

    "driving_suggestion": "Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe distance from the yellow vehicle ahead and prepare to comply with the instructions of the overhead signs. As traffic cones and obstacles limit the use of lanes, they should not attempt to change lanes. Due to wet road conditions, it is advisable to reduce speed and heighten vigilance to deal with potential losses of traction. Autonomous vehicles should also keep a safe distance from the traffic cones ahead and adjust their position accordingly to stay within the designated lane. Continually observing vulnerable road users on the sidewalks is crucial in order to anticipate any potential crossing behaviors and respond in a timely manner. Overall, it is recommended to maintain a high level of situational awareness in such changing environments.",

It is often used to signal to drivers that they must move away from a certain area due to road work, an obstacle, or to guide traffic through a detour. In this scenario, the ego car should steer clear of the traffic cone, ensuring it stays within the navigable driving path and obeys any temporary lane changes or directions indicated by the arrangement of cones.",
