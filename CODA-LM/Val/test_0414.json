        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, a truck is observed directly in front of the ego car, within the same lane. The truck is notably transporting two orange-colored construction vehicles, which leads to partial obstruction of the view further down the roadway. Given the heavy load, it is likely that this truck is moving at a slower pace than the usual traffic flow, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe following distance. Additionally, the height of the load due to the transported vehicles suggests potential stability issues with the truck's cargo; hence, caution is advised, and the ego car may need to consider a lane change for safe travel.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones set up on the road. These cones are narrowing the drivable lane, signifying either an ongoing road hazard or construction work in the vicinity. In response to this setup, the ego car is required to keep within the constraints of the remaining open lane and modulate speed accordingly. The traffic cones are an indication that there might be an obstruction ahead, which would imply that changing lanes is essential for continued safe driving."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is often used to guide traffic or to indicate areas that are closed to vehicles and pedestrians. Traffic cones are generally orange and white in color and made of a lightweight plastic or rubber material that makes them highly visible and easy to move. In the context of driving behavior, the presence of a traffic cone on the road typically signals the driver to either slow down, merge into an adjacent lane, or be aware of potential hazards such as construction work or an accident ahead. Consequently, the driver of the ego car should exercise caution and be prepared to adjust their driving accordingly.",

Reduce speed in response to the traffic cones and watch for any signs or signals indicating roadwork or detours. Stay alert for any instructions from road workers and keep within the lane boundaries. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead. Monitor the surrounding environment for any indications of roadworks or other reasons for the traffic cones and be prepared to merge to the adjacent lane if necessary. Adjust speed to ensure safety when considering the load of the truck and any potential instability or stops it may cause."
