The proximity of the truck indicates that it is either moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle or that it is stationary. The ego vehicle's driver should maintain a safe distance from the truck due to its large size and the potential for sudden stops or movements that could result in debris falling from the mixer.",

The ego vehicle should monitor the truck's indicators and wheels for signs of intention to merge. Also, remain vigilant for any pedestrians near the crossing, despite there being none visible at the moment. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the concrete mixer truck, being aware of potential blind spots created by the truck. Proceed with caution at the pedestrian crossing, watching for any pedestrians that may enter the crosswalk. If visibility is restricted due to the truck, be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary. The ego vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop or yield due to the presence of the zebra crossing. Additionally, the vehicle should not attempt to pass the concrete mixer truck without ensuring there is enough space in the adjacent lane to do so safely. The driver should be vigilant for any pedestrians around the crossing and other vehicles that might be navigating around the truck."
