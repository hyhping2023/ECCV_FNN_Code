A pedestrian crossing sign on the left indicates a crosswalk where pedestrians have the right of way, reinforcing the need for the ego car to yield to pedestrians.\n\nThe status of the traffic lights in the image is not clear, leading to the recommendation that the ego car should approach the intersection ready to safely stop if the lights turn red. There are no traffic cones mentioned.\n\nA small white barrier is in front of the bus on the right, possibly indicating a closed lane or obstruction that needs to be navigated around. Additionally, there is a dustbin on the far right sidewalk in front of the bus, which doesn't pose an immediate risk for the driving behavior unless someone steps onto the road from that area."
