The vehicle should use its headlights if not already on, reduce speed significantly to allow for a safe stopping distance, and be attentive to any sudden appearances of road users or obstacles within the range of the vehicle's headlights. If necessary, the ego car should come to a complete stop until visibility improves or until it has accurately determined that the path ahead is safe and clear of obstacles and road users. Additionally, if equipped, engage any night vision or enhanced visibility systems and consider pulling over safely and waiting for conditions to improve if the vehicle's sensors or cameras are unable to provide reliable data."
