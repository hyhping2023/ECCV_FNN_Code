        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles present. \n\nOn the left side of the picture, a silver SUV is seen maintaining a moderate distance from the main vehicle and moving in the opposite direction. The proximity and relative speed of this SUV to our car are factors considered in maintaining a safe distance and anticipating the SUV's potential lane changes.\n\nRight in front of our car, a silver sedan is occupying the center of the lane. Since the sedan closely follows the direct path of the self-driving car, it will determine the following distance and speed of the self-driving car to ensure safe driving.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow construction vehicle is parked on the left lane under the bridge, with conspicuous warning stripes at the rear, indicating it is likely undergoing maintenance or related work. The presence of this construction vehicle in the left lane requires the main vehicle to change lanes or reduce speed to ensure safety and comply with any potential work zone traffic regulations.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting driving behavior in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a steady speed while monitoring the SUV on the left in case it suddenly changes lanes. Continue to watch for any additional traffic signs or changes in road conditions when passing through construction areas. Keep a safe following distance behind the sedan and check mirrors and blind spots for opportunities to safely change lanes and overtake the crane, then return to the original lane when necessary. Note that since this is a work area under an overpass, drive cautiously and adjust your speed according to potential reduced speed limits to ensure safe operation.",

This vehicle might influence the driving behavior by necessitating a reduction in speed and increased caution.
