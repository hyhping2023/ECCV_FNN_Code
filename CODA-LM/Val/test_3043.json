Its rear end is close to the ego car's lane, which may necessitate a slight steering adjustment by the ego car to ensure safe passage, as the parked vehicle reduces the available driving space.\n\nThe traffic lights are visible ahead, but due to sun glare, it is challenging to determine their current state. This uncertainty could prevent the ego car from making timely decisions about speed adjustments, and therefore, it should approach the intersection with caution.\n\nNo traffic cones are present in the image, indicating that there are no road works or lane closures that might influence the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there is a significant glare from the sun directly ahead, which could severely affect visibility. This glare has the potential to obscure traffic signals, signs, and other road users, necessitating increased caution from the ego car."
