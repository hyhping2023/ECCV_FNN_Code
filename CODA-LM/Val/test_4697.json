        "description and explanation": "In this traffic image, three vehicles are noted. The first vehicle is a car with its brake lights on, positioned on the right side of the ego car's lane and facing the same direction. This suggests the car is either slowing down or preparing to stop, potentially requiring the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes. The second vehicle is a sedan directly ahead, partly in the ego lane and partly in the left lane, with brake lights illuminated. This undecided lane positioning coupled with the brake lights indicates a potential stop or slowdown, necessitating the ego car to be prepared to slow down or stop to avoid a collision. The third vehicle is in the opposite lane heading towards the ego car, identifiable by its headlights. The visibility of these headlights helps define the boundaries of the opposite lane, aiding the ego car's lane-keeping decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights are undiscernible due to the image quality and distance, meaning the ego car should proceed with caution, particularly when approaching intersections or signals.\n\nAdditionally, there are some 'other objects' detected: illuminated street lights provide visibility in the dark, though they can also cause glare, which the vehicle's systems need to manage to maintain clear visibility. Reflective road markers are visible on the road surface, likely defining lanes, which aid in lane keeping and navigation, especially under low light conditions."

Additionally, due to the low visibility conditions at night, the ego vehicle should use its lights appropriately and pay extra attention to potential hazards that might not be clearly visible. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle directly ahead. Be prepared to adjust speed if the car on the right begins to enter the lane or come to a complete stop. Use the reflective road markers as guidance to stay within the lane, especially in areas with limited visibility, and ensure headlights and taillights are active for visibility."
