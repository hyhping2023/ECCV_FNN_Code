It is positioned facing away from our car, and its presence is significant for understanding traffic flow and right-of-way at the intersection. It is essential to monitor whether this vehicle is stationary or moving to make informed decisions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue rectangular traffic sign with a white arrow pointing left, indicating the presence of a pedestrian overpass in that direction. This sign is helpful for drivers to anticipate potential pedestrian movements and adjust their driving if needed.\n\nLastly, there are red and white striped construction barriers on the left side of the road. These barriers imply that there might be a lane closure or road construction ahead. As a result, drivers will need to be cautious, potentially slowing down or changing lanes to navigate the area safely."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of a construction zone, the vehicle should slow down when approaching the area, follow the detour signs, and prepare to turn left according to traffic sign instructions. Drivers should stay alert for any construction personnel or unexpected obstacles. Always follow any temporary road signs that may exist but are not visible in the current line of sight. The vehicle should proceed cautiously at a reduced speed, be prepared to yield to oncoming vehicles if necessary, and follow the detour route indicated by traffic signs. In light of the construction zone, if the right side of the road is blocked or closed due to construction, the vehicle should be prepared to change lanes to the left. Since there are no visible traffic lights or clear signs indicating the right of way, the vehicle should be prepared to navigate intersections according to any temporary instructions given by road rules and signs in the construction zone. Approach intersections carefully and be prepared to slow down or stop if a van enters the intersection. Be mindful of changes in lane availability caused by construction obstacles and be prepared to yield to pedestrians at crosswalks. If planning to turn left, signal in advance and cautiously execute the turn considering possible obstructions caused by the ongoing roadwork.",
