        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario includes several road users impacting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there is a large truck to the left, featuring reflective stripes and protruding equipment, partially occupying the ego vehicle's lane. The truckâ€™s position and size potentially obstruct the path and limit visibility, presenting a risk due to its cargo possibly shifting or extending further into the ego car's lane. Additionally, a bus is located on the right side, adorned with characters and progressing in the same direction within an adjacent lane. Occasional stops by the bus might cause it to decelerate or halt abruptly, necessitating vigilance as it could affect the surrounding traffic flow when ferrying passengers. Directly ahead in the same lane, a sedan is present, discernible by its activated brake lights indicating that it is either slowing down or has ceased movement. This requires the ego vehicle to maintain a sufficient following distance and readiness to halt.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic light observed is green but is partially obscured by the large vehicle to the left. This necessitates cautious monitoring of the traffic light and readiness for any changes, underlining the importance of considering other visible signals and preparedness to stop at the approaching intersection."

Given its size and the nature of its operation, it generally has a dedicated lane or may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers. In a traffic scene, this vehicle's presence suggests that the ego car should maintain a safe distance to allow for potential stops and anticipate the bus merging back into traffic after stopping.",

It may be carrying heavy equipment or materials and could have reduced maneuverability.

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego vehicle should slow down and maintain a safe following distance from the sedan directly ahead, be cautious of the large truck's movements since it's intruding into the ego vehicle's lane, and prepare for possible stops due to the moving bus. Additionally, the ego vehicle should monitor the traffic light and prepare for a potential yellow or red light, as it is currently green but may change soon. Due to the large truck's overhanging cargo, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from it and be prepared to reduce speed or change lanes if necessary for safety. Since the vehicle ahead is showing brake lights, the ego car should also prepare to stop or slow down, adhering to safe following distances. Caution is advised due to the size of the bus on the right, which may limit the ego car's maneuverability. Finally, the ego car should observe the red light ahead and come to a complete stop at the intersection, following traffic laws and ensuring safety. Given the visible road users and conditions, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead, be alert for any potential sudden stops, especially from the bus to the right, and adjust its speed for the wet road conditions to mitigate the risk of hydroplaning. The ego car should also stay aware of the large military vehicle to the left, as it could obscure hazards or road signs. Lastly, the ego car should monitor the traffic lights for changes that could affect the flow of traffic."
