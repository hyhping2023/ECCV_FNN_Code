The presence of this sign alerts drivers that the road ahead will change direction, necessitating preparation to safely navigate the forthcoming turn.\n\nAdditionally, several reflective orange and yellow traffic cones are arranged in a conical formation beginning from the left side and extending forward. They reflect the direction our vehicle is traveling in. These cones serve as markers to indicate that the lanes ahead are closed, possibly due to road construction, and thus, it is imperative for the vehicle to merge left and maneuver around the zone that the cones demarcate.\n\nThere are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the JSON data for the current traffic image."

It is typically used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, though it may also be used to mark off areas. Given its placement, the ego car must maneuver around the traffic cone, ensuring not to hit it, which may require changing lanes or adjusting the car's position on the road.",
