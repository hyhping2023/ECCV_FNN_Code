This vehicle may affect driving behavior as it could be actively participating in traffic by slowing down, stopping, or preparing to maneuver. Additionally, the image shows glare caused by dim lighting and damp surfaces. This poor lighting condition can reduce visibility for both the vehicle's sensors and the driver, making it more challenging to detect obstacles and road users. Therefore, the autonomous vehicle should drive more cautiously."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the red car and be prepared to stop or slow down at any time in case the car makes any movements. Due to poor lighting conditions and potential road unevenness, the vehicle should reduce speed to enhance reaction time to any unexpected events. Drive carefully, maintain a low speed, and ensure there is enough reaction time to respond to sudden movements of the red vehicle. Monitor the red vehicle's lights and any movement cues to anticipate its intentions. To address possible slippery road conditions, avoid sharp turns and sudden braking.",
