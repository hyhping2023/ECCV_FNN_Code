There are two vehicles identified in the scene. The first is a blue bus situated directly in front of the ego car within the same lane. Currently, the bus appears to be stationary or moving at a low speed, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintain an adequate distance for safety reasons and be ready to halt or decelerate as needed. The second vehicle is a greenish car located to the left of the ego car, occupying an adjacent lane and positioned slightly ahead. The presence of the greenish car means the ego car must be cautious if considering a lane change to the left.\n\nAdditionally, there's a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the right side of the picture, who is not obstructing the path of the ego car. Although the pedestrian poses no immediate threat to the vehicle's progression, they should be continuously observed in case there's a decision to step onto the street.\n\nAs for the traffic infrastructure, there are traffic lights visible over the intersection ahead. The lights' colors are not currently observable. Still, they are crucial for the ego vehicle, as the driver must be ready to adjust the car's movements in accordance with the imminent signal.\n\nLastly, a metal barrier separates the sidewalk from the roadway on the right. This barrier is not an obstruction for the ego vehicle's path but serves as a clear demarcation between the driving lane and the sidewalk, reminding the ego car to keep within the marked lane boundaries.\n\nThere are no reports of traffic signs, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects affecting the driving conditions in the provided data."
