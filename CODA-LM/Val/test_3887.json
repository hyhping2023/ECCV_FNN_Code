        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a couple of vehicles and various other objects to take note of. First, there's a blue truck parked on the left side of the road, facing the opposite direction of my vehicle. We need to be mindful that the truck may either start moving or there may be activity around it, such as the driver opening the door or stepping onto the street, which could potentially pose a danger to oncoming vehicles like the self-driving car.\n\nOn the right side of the road, ahead next to a blue building, another truck is parked. Since the truck seems to be in a position that could indicate loading or unloading activities, or it might be parked temporarily, self-driving vehicles should remain cautious while approaching this area.\n\nFurthermore, there are a few objects present that could affect driving conditions. On both sides of the road, there appear to be piles of debris, such as sand or broken stones, with a more significant accumulation on the left side. This kind of debris has the potential to damage tires or become a hazard if scattered onto the driving path.\n\nAdditionally, due to dense trees on both sides of the road and prevailing foggy conditions, visibility is less clear. The risks presented by trees include possible falling branches, particularly in adverse weather, requiring reduced speed and heightened alertness while driving through the area.\n\nLastly, there is a small pile of broken stones or materials on the left side of the road, an obstacle that may force the autonomous vehicle to adjust its path slightly to the right to avoid the debris. \n\nThe summarized situation indicates that vehicles and other objects in the scene warrant careful navigation, with a requirement to possibly alter the standard driving path and adjustments to speed and vigilance to ensure safe passage."

    "driving_suggestion": "Vehicles should maintain a safe speed and distance, stay away from parked trucks, and be alert to any unpredictable movements. Approach other parked vehicles with caution, be aware of road surface changes, and avoid any debris. Continuously monitor changes in road conditions, such as the appearance of vulnerable road users or new obstacles. Due to the visibility limitations caused by haze and the potential dangers from roadside debris, it is recommended to increase following distance and maintain a high level of vigilance.",

In this scenario, the ego car should remain within the boundaries defined by the yellow line to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations. Driving behavior should be adjusted to maintain a steady course within the designated driving lane, observing the yellow line as a guide.",
