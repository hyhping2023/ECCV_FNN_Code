            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, recognizable by its large rotating drum used for mixing concrete components. With its bulky structure and operational equipment, it might move slower than regular traffic and could make sudden stops or maneuvers that are related to construction work. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential changes in the construction vehicle's speed or direction, especially if the vehicle is actively engaged in construction activities. Caution and attentiveness are required when driving near such vehicles due to the possibility of construction-related debris on the road or the vehicle taking up more space than a typical vehicle.",

Be prepared to adjust speed accordingly and consider overtaking if the truck moves significantly slower than the speed limit and road conditions allow for a safe overtaking maneuver. Continuously scan the road ahead for any unexpected hazards, particularly around areas with higher concentrations of side objects where visibility may be compromised. Watch for any signals from the truck indicating it may be turning or stopping. If the mixer truck shows signs of slowing down or turning, be prepared to reduce speed and change lanes if necessary to maintain a smooth flow of traffic. Keep an eye out for any road users who might emerge from side streets or parking areas."
