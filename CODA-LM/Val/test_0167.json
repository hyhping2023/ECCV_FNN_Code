They come in white and various other colors, with those on the right side diagonal to the curb and those on the left parallel to it. These stationary vehicles reduce the usable width of the road and may obscure pedestrians or other obstacles from view. They also pose potential hazards if any doors open suddenly or if a vehicle starts moving unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there is an approaching vehicle in the opposite lane with its headlights on, moving towards the ego car. This oncoming vehicle necessitates cautious observation to ensure staying within the correct lane. The ego car needs to monitor this vehicle for its speed and potential lane deviations.\n\nMoreover, distant traffic lights are visible ahead. Although the exact color of the lights cannot be identified from the image, it is likely green as vehicles are observed moving. These traffic lights control the flow of traffic, and the ego car must be prepared to respond to any changes, including potentially stopping if the light turns red."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a motorized two-wheeled vehicle, commonly referred to as a moped. Mopeds typically have a small engine and are designed for economical and relatively slower travel compared to motorcycles. In a driving scenario, the presence of a moped indicates that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or turns by the moped. Additionally, the ego car should be cautious when passing or overtaking the moped, ensuring there is ample space to do so safely, as mopeds can be less stable than cars at higher speeds or in windy conditions.",

Be prepared to adjust speed or stop according to the traffic light that can change. Watch for potential hazards such as pedestrians emerging from between the parked vehicles and oncoming traffic from the opposite lane. Use the headlights effectively to increase visibility and signal intentions to other road users. Maintain a moderate speed, be prepared to stop for the traffic light ahead, and be cautious of the narrow space due to parked vehicles. The vehicle should also monitor the oncoming traffic and be prepared for reduced traction if the road is indeed wet."
