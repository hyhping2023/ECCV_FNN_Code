The presence of this vehicle is crucial as any of its movements such as stopping, slowing down, or making a turn will influence the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nNo vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present in the scene.\n\nA notable traffic sign is an overhead directional sign that provides lane direction information, indicating lanes for going straight or turning left. This sign is essential for the ego car to determine the correct lane to continue along its intended route.\n\nThe traffic light situated on the far side of the intersection displays red for lanes proceeding straight and a red arrow for the left turn lane, signifying that vehicles, including the ego car, are required to halt.\n\nTraffic cones have been placed on the left side of the intersection, suggestive of a cautionary area or a construction site. This set-up mandates that the ego car be ready to decelerate or steer clear of possible hindrances within the marked zone.\n\nYellow pedestrian barriers are installed on the left, delineating the pedestrian path from the roadway. These barriers serve as an indication that pedestrian crossing is not permitted at this location, thereby minimizing the risk of pedestrian-related incidents for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, portable delineators and a small traffic sign decorated with red and white striping are situated on the left, signaling an area that is off-limits. These items denote temporary alterations to traffic flow or restricted areas, necessitating the ego car to remain vigilant in order to navigate the surroundings securely."
