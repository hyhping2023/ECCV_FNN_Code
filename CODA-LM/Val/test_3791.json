The container has 'FC6120' visible on the back, and a vehicle's headlights visible underneath, indicating its tall clearance. It has red and white reflective markings on the rear for visibility.",

Given the size of the truck, the ego car has reduced visibility ahead which necessitates increased following distance to accommodate for the truck's potential sudden stops or turns."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large, brown cargo truck directly ahead of the ego car in the same lane. The truck's rear safety markings are partially visible and reflective, with the container displaying 'FC6120' on the back. Notably, a vehicle's headlights can be seen underneath the truck, indicating it has a high clearance. The truck is equipped with red and white reflective markings on the rear to enhance visibility. The presence of this truck necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and remains alert to adjust its speed or change lanes if the truck slows down or stops. Due to the truck's size, the ego car's visibility of the road ahead is significantly reduced, which requires an increased following distance to account for any sudden stops or turns the truck may make. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

When driving behind such a vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to ensure there is adequate time to react in case the truck slows down or stops suddenly.

Use headlights and possibly high beams if there are no oncoming vehicles to improve visibility. Ensure headlights are appropriately adjusted for nighttime driving, and continue monitoring the truck's brake lights and indicators for any sudden changes in speed or direction. If the truck slows down or signals for a turn, the ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down accordingly or, if safe and legal, consider a lane change to pass the truck."
