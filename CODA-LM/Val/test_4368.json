        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large red truck on the right side of the frame, moving to the left in a different lane, causing some obstruction of the view ahead. The truck's size and position mean that visibility is reduced, and it's crucial to maintain a safe following distance, also considering the possibility of changing lanes or merging to avoid potential hazards.\n\nFurther away, various cars are observed spread out over several lanes. These cars necessitate attentiveness on behalf of the autonomous vehicle, which needs to track their speeds and trajectories to anticipate the flow of traffic, ensure a secure following distance, and find possible openings for lane changes.\n\nOn the side of the road opposite the central divider, there are white cars moving in the opposite direction to the autonomous vehicle. While these cars do not directly influence the immediate decisions of the vehicle, it is essential to keep track of oncoming traffic for comprehensive situational awareness.\n\nAdditionally, the image contains a traffic light, viewable on an overhead structure, which seems to be red or its state is indiscernible. The autonomous vehicle must prepare for appropriate actions as it nears the intersection, which include stopping if the light remains red or if there is a chance that the light may soon change.\n\nLastly, yellow barriers are erected in the middle of the road to demarcate the separate traffic directions. These barriers signal that crossing or making turns through the central divider is prohibited, and therefore, the vehicle must continue in its current lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this image."

Be ready to react to traffic lights at any time, while obeying lane markings when navigating around obstacles, maintain a moderate speed, and stay vigilant as the exact status of the traffic lights is unclear. Do not cross lanes or the central divider to turn. Adjust your speed timely if road conditions or traffic density change.",
