The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this vehicle to allow for adequate reaction time in case the vehicle suddenly stops or turns.\n   - A large truck is visible further ahead in the same lane as the ego car and appears to be stopped or moving slowly. The ego car should be aware of the truck's movements, as its larger size may obstruct vision and its actions could affect traffic flow.\n   - Multiple cars are positioned in adjacent lanes to the left, some of which are showing brake lights, suggesting slow traffic or potential lane-changing activity. The ego car must monitor these vehicles closely for unexpected lane changes or stops that may impact its path.\n   - A white car is on the right side of the ego car, moving at a similar speed. This car's position affects the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right and it should be monitored in case it decides to merge or change lanes unexpectedly.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs:**\n   - An illuminated blue traffic sign with a white arrow and characters indicates a detour or a turn-off ahead on the right. The ego car should be prepared for the possibility of vehicles ahead slowing down or changing lanes to follow the detour.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones:**\n   - Traffic cones are arranged on the right side of the ego car's lane, funneling traffic into specific lanes and away from a section of the roadway. The ego car should remain in its current lane and follow the guided path marked by the cones, ensuring it does not cross into the restricted area.\n   - Multiple traffic cones are aligned on the left side of the red car, indicating that the left lane is closed or there is roadwork. These cones necessitate the ego car and other vehicles to merge right if in the left lane and to proceed with caution due to possible workers or equipment in or near the driving lane.\n\n4. **Barriers:**\n   - Temporary barriers are positioned on the right side of the road parallel to the traffic cones, reinforcing the lane restrictions. The ego car must not cross these barriers and should maintain a safe distance to avoid collision.\n   - Additional temporary barriers on the right indicate a partition between lanes or direct traffic flow due to construction or lane closure. These barriers could narrow the drivable area or signal upcoming traffic pattern changes, requiring the ego vehicle to adapt its lane position.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects are not present in this traffic image."

Traffic cones are used to mark areas where traffic may need to merge or change lanes due to road work or obstacles. In this scenario, the cone indicates that part of the road is obstructed and vehicles should navigate away from the coned-off area, leading to a potential narrowing of drivable lanes and the need for the ego car to adjust its lane position accordingly.",

Additionally, due to the detour indicated by the traffic sign, the driver should be vigilant for vehicles that may slow down to take the turn-off. Following the path set by the traffic cones and barriers is essential for safety and compliance with traffic directions."
