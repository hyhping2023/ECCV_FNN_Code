These oncoming vehicles indicate that the vehicle should maintain its current lane and be cautious of potential turns or unexpected movements.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - On the left side of the road's centerline, yellow traffic cones are placed between the parking area and the driving lane. These cones indicate the separation of lanes and guide the flow of traffic, suggesting that the vehicle will travel a narrower path.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - Large blue barriers are lined up on the right side of the road, marking an ongoing construction area. These barriers indicate a closed lane or a safety zone for workers, requiring the vehicle to stay in the open lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects noted in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from vehicles on the left, preparing to deal with potential obstacles or workers brought about by barricades and construction signs indicating ongoing construction. This may necessitate the anticipation of lane merging or shifting. As there are no visible traffic lights, it implies that driving should proceed under the assumption that the light ahead is green, unless otherwise directed, following general traffic rules. Driving speed should be adjusted appropriately to cope with the construction area. Keep a safe following distance from the truck ahead, stay in the current lane, and monitor for any indications or changes that may arise due to oncoming traffic and construction. Given the absence of visible traffic lights and potentially unseen road conditions beyond this image, cautious driving is advised. Maintain a safe distance from the SUV on the left, watch for any changes from the truck in front, stay alert to possible directions from traffic signs on barricades, and by staying in the left lane, avoid areas next to conical signs. If entering a construction zone, slow down as appropriate, and follow any temporary traffic lights or signs that may be present out of view.",
