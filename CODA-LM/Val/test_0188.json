This vehicle's speed and behavioral patterns are critical as they will have a direct impact on the driving decisions of the ego vehicle. Although there are no vulnerable road users like pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists present in this scene, there are other notable elements to consider.\n\nVisible above the road on the right-hand side are directional signs, providing crucial information about lane designations and directions for travel. These signs are essential as they inform the ego vehicle of the upcoming road layout and any potential lane changes that may be required to continue on the desired route.\n\nThe right lane features orange traffic cones, which serve as a barrier between the vehicle lane and a construction site, indicating that the right lane is likely closed ahead. Vehicles in the right lane are advised to merge left to avoid the obstruction. There are also temporary barriers placed around the construction site area on the right side, further emphasizing the work zone and enforcing the closure of the right lane. These barriers are set up to ensure the safety of road workers and the integrity of the construction area.\n\nAmong other objects in the scene, road workers are notable. They are present on the right side of the road, engaged in construction activities that require the use of large machinery and materials such as asphalt. Their proximity to the driving lanes and the potential for unexpected movements necessitate caution and a reduced speed from vehicles passing by the construction site."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker used on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is usually orange and white or red and white in color to ensure high visibility. Traffic cones are often used to mark out areas where road work is taking place or where accidents have occurred. The cone signals to the ego car that it should stay clear of a particular area and may need to adjust its lane position for safety reasons.",
