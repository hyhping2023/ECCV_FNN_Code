Additionally, a white car is visible in the background on the opposite side of the road, facing the opposite direction, and is not immediately relevant to the ego car's driving decisions, as it does not have a direct impact on the ego car's immediate driving behavior.\n\nThere is also a red stop sign on the right side of the road, indicating an upcoming intersection where vehicles must come to a complete stop before proceeding. This demands that the ego vehicle must prepare to stop regardless of other road users' actions.\n\nTemporary traffic barriers, yellow and black in color, are present on the right-hand side of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating roadwork or lane closure ahead. These barriers suggest that the ego vehicle may need to adjust its lane position or reduce speed to navigate through the modified traffic path. Furthermore, grey concrete barriers are seen to the right of the road, potentially indicating ongoing construction or permanent fixtures defining road boundaries. The ego car must remain clear of these barriers to avoid a collision and may need to adapt lane positioning accordingly."
