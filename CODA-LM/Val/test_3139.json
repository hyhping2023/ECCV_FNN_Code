It is stationary, so the ego car needs to remain vigilant for any sudden movements or door openings while navigating around it.\n   - An orange excavator is situated on the left side of the ego car, engaged in construction work. Its boom is positioned away from the road, indicating potential road work or obstacles. The ego car should exercise caution when passing by.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A worker wearing a blue uniform and a red helmet is present near the excavator, monitoring the construction work. Their proximity to the road and potential for unexpected movement necessitate the ego car to slow down and pass cautiously.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A yellow sign with black text is mounted on a pole above the construction area on the left side. It likely indicates construction warnings or instructions for passing vehicles. The ego car should adhere to any indicated restrictions or hazards.\n\nThe absence of traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects in the scene suggests that these elements do not currently impact driving behavior."

Its design includes a significant arm mechanism with a digging bucket, which is used for digging and moving large amounts of soil or other materials. In this scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle by the roadside suggests potential road work or construction activity nearby.
