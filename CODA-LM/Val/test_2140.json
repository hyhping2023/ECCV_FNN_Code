Additionally, there are several vehicles ahead in both lanes, including a yellow truck on the left and cars in the right lane traveling in the same direction. These vehicles control the flow of traffic and may necessitate speed adjustment or lane changes by the ego car. Finally, a car on the lateral right side is possibly merging or maintaining its lane, requiring monitoring to anticipate any potential actions that could affect the ego car's trajectory.\n\nFor \"vulnerable_road_users,\" a worker is visible on the right side of the road near the construction zone. The proximity of the worker to the roadway necessitates reducing speed and exercising caution to ensure their safety. There are also workers on the left roadside next to blue fencing, partially in the road, creating a potential hazard that requires the ego car to proceed with caution and potentially move slightly right in the lane if space allows.\n\nIn the \"traffic signs\" category, there are no parking and maximum vehicle height limit signs on the right side of the road. The no parking sign indicates that stopping in this zone is prohibited, while the height limit is relevant for any tall vehicle considerations.\n\nFor \"traffic cones,\" traffic cones are set up around a construction area on the right side of the road. These delineate a work zone and require the ego car to be attentive to possible changes in traffic patterns and the presence of workers.\n\nIn the \"barriers\" category, blue temporary construction barriers are present on the right, indicating a sectioned-off work area. These barriers signify construction activities that may affect road conditions and traffic flow, necessitating heightened awareness.\n\nLastly, in the \"other objects\" category, there is debris on the road in the left lane near the construction workers, which heightens the potential for tire damage or loss of traction, necessitating extra caution. Additionally, there is construction machinery and equipment on the right side within the construction zone. The presence of machinery could lead to unexpected movements, debris, and workers, which commands a lower speed and readiness to stop."

Abide by the speed limit of 80 km/h, but adjust speed according to the wet road conditions to avoid skidding. Stay observant for any construction-related changes in traffic patterns or unexpected entries into the road from the construction area. Keep to the lanes as dictated by the barriers and road signs, avoiding the no-entry zone. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the cement truck and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes due to the stopped vehicles ahead. Caution should be exercised due to construction work on the right side, with specific attention to the workers, traffic cones, and construction barriers. The wet road conditions require the ego car to reduce speed and drive with heightened caution to account for increased stopping distances and potential slippery surfaces. Adherence to posted traffic signs including the height limitation should be observed."
