        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two significant road users categorized under vehicles, impacting the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle:\n\n1. The first road user is a large truck directly in front of our vehicle within the same lane. The truck's notable features include its visible license plate and cargo, which is partially covered. It is moving forward, indicating it is actively participating in the traffic flow. The proximity and movement of this truck dictate the following distance and speed that our autonomous vehicle should maintain to ensure safety. Additionally, the truck's presence limits the visibility of the road ahead for our vehicle, necessitating a cautious approach to any potential road changes or hazards that may lie beyond the truck.\n\n2. The second road user is another large truck, situated in the left lane adjacent to our own. This truck bears a resemblance to the first, with its cargo also covered by a tarp and moving forward, positioning slightly ahead of our vehicle. The strategic placement and motion of this truck suggest it could potentially influence our vehicle's ability to change lanes safely. Due to the truckâ€™s size and location, visibility ahead could be compromised, requiring vigilant observation of the surrounding traffic and careful consideration before attempting any lane changes.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects were noted in the image, indicating their absence or lack of impact on the driving conditions for our autonomous vehicle in this specific scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance to ensure ample reaction time in case the truck ahead suddenly stops or turns. Adjust your speed and be ready to respond to changes in traffic flow or road sign instructions. Before attempting to change lanes, monitor the trucks in the left lane to avoid blind spots and ensure safe maneuvering. Continuously watch for any additional signs, traffic lights, or changes in road conditions. Since large trucks may partially occupy neighboring lanes, be prepared to adjust your lane position to avoid them at all times. It is equally important to observe the truck's signal lights in case their lane changes or stops affect your driving route.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy vehicle commonly referred to as a truck. It is a large motor vehicle designed to transport cargo. In this scenario, the truck appears to be a tractor with a flatbed trailer covered with a tarp; such vehicles are often used to carry goods that require protection from weather conditions but do not need to be fully enclosed. For the ego car, the presence of this truck influences driving behavior by requiring the driver to maintain a safe following distance due to the truck's larger blind spots and longer stopping distances. The ego car's driver should also be aware that trucks have wider turn radii and may make wider turns.",
