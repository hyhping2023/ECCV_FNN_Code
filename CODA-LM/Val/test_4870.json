        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present; however, there are several other objects of interest. The first object is a cluster of bicycles parked on the sidewalk. While these bicycles are not directly in the path of the vehicle, their presence indicates a potentially high pedestrian area, which adds complexity to the driving environment and may require increased vigilance for pedestrian activity.\n\nAdditionally, there's a presence of blurred lights and possibly reflective surfaces on the right side of the image. These high-luminosity indications suggest there might be other vehicles or reflective objects nearby that can be relevant for navigation and require attention for full situational awareness.\n\nFinally, there seems to be debris or objects on the right side of the road, identifiable by irregular shapes and shadows. Autonomous vehicles should note these hazards and ensure they maintain their lane position while keeping a safe distance from such obstacles to avoid potential damage or accidents."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the unclear imagery and the possibility that stationary bicycles may become mobile, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed and keep a safe distance from areas where bicycles are parked along the road. Additionally, items resembling tires appearing on the road suggest that there may be a need to alter the driving path to avoid these obstacles. Continue to monitor any potentially vulnerable road users who may enter the road space, and be prepared to stop or yield if necessary. Due to poor visibility and potential wet and slippery road conditions, a lower than usual speed should be maintained to increase reaction time for unexpected hazards. Be ready to respond to potentially vulnerable road users that may suddenly appear, and keep a safe distance from parked trucks. Keep an eye out for traffic signs and signals that may become visible during the journey.",
