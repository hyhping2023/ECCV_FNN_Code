On the right side of the road, there is a white crane truck positioned diagonally, partially occupying the lane. This truck may obstruct part of the road and reduce the usable lane width, which will require drivers to maneuver carefully. On the left side, there are several parked vehicles, including green trucks and a white van, which are parallel to the kerb. These vehicles narrow the road from the left, and there is a need for drivers to be vigilant in case any of these vehicles start moving.\n\nAdditionally, there is a person wearing high visibility clothing on the raised dirt area to the right. Although they are not on the road, their proximity to the work site indicates that there might be potential movement or other unexpected actions that could affect road safety.\n\nAlong the same raised dirt area to the right, there is green fencing indicating construction or a restricted area. This barrier suggests that there may be roadwork or changes to the normal traffic pattern, and as a result, the ego car should slow down and proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, there are debris and tarps scattered on the raised dirt area to the right behind the fencing. These objects could potentially be blown onto the road, so it is important for drivers to remain alert to such hazards.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

Be aware of the potential for movement from the parked vehicles on the left, and monitor any activity within the construction site to the right for unexpected incursions into the roadway. Maintain a lower speed to ensure there is adequate time to react to any unforeseen hazards. Keep a safe distance from the parked trucks on the left side in case of unexpected movement. Continuously monitor the area for any signs of activity from the workers or the presence of new obstacles that may not be visible yet. Proceed with heightened caution due to the possible presence of construction or work zones."
