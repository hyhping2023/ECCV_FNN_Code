Without a clear view of the traffic lights, the ego car must rely on the behavior of the vehicle in front and exercise caution to ensure it responds appropriately to the traffic signals."

        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene presents a large cement mixer truck directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The truck occupies the entire drivable lane space, with its rear lights on, indicating it is either at a stop or moving slowly. Due to the truck's considerable size and position, the ego vehicle is unable to maneuver or overtake easily. The presence of the truck can cause visibility issues, hiding potential road hazards or signs that may affect driving decisions and reactions.\n\nAdditionally, traffic signs in the image are hard to discern because of reflections and the low quality of the image, which may be exacerbated by weather conditions. This can result in a lack of critical information that could affect driving behaviors such as missing speed limits, warnings, or necessary directional guidance.\n\nLastly, there is a traffic light situated above the truck showing a red signal. This light dictates that all traffic, including the ego car, must come to a halt until a green signal is displayed. Visibility of the traffic light may be compromised due to the truck's position, thus the ego vehicle must monitor the lead truck's actions carefully to comply with the traffic lights without a direct line of sight."

Be cautious and prepare to stop, as the truck's brake lights indicate it may be responding to a traffic light or an obstacle ahead. Drive at reduced speeds to ensure safety on the wet surface. The ego vehicle should also prepare to stop or be at a stop, obeying the red traffic light. Until the light turns green and the truck proceeds, the ego vehicle should not attempt to overtake or maneuver around the truck due to the lack of visible clearance and the need to adhere to traffic signals."
