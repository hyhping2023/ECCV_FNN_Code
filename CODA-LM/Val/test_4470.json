Specifically, a large truck is observed parked on the left side ahead on the road, situated in a rest area or checkpoint adjacent to the main thoroughfare. Although the truck is not directly on the main road, caution is advised as its movement towards the road should be monitored. Additionally, multiple traffic cones are visible, arranged in alternating red/white and yellow/black patterns in the center of two lanes. They guide the traffic to merge into a single lane ahead. This setup usually indicates road construction or lane closures, necessitating a reduction in speed and an increase in driving caution to safely navigate the area."

If your vehicle needs to exit, be prepared to signal and change lanes safely before reaching the split point. Pay attention to the signs and choose the correct lane in advance. As traffic lights are not visible, continue to drive cautiously and adhere to the standard road rules that may apply at intersections or junctions ahead. Your vehicle should slow down and be ready to merge into the single open lane as directed by the traffic cones. It is recommended to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front to prevent sudden stops or changes in traffic flow.",

It is typically placed to control or limit access to certain areas, direct traffic flow, or mark construction zones. Its presence suggests that there may be a temporary change in normal traffic patterns or that a certain part of the road is off-limits. Drivers should slow down and prepare to possibly change lanes or navigate around this obstacle.",
