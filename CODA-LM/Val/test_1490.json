        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, various road users and elements are described.\n\nVehicles: There is a white compact car immediately in front of the self-driving vehicle with its brake lights engaged, which is critical for judging appropriate following distance and readiness to stop or decelerate. Additionally, a silver sedan is noted on the right, slightly ahead, which could suggest a possible lane merging situation or a traffic flow change, mandating vigilance and preparedness for altered driving conditions.\n\nVulnerable Road Users: A cyclist is observed crossing the road ahead, on the left, and their presence dictates the necessity for maintaining safe distancing and adhering to right-of-way rules. This impacts the decision-making of the autonomous vehicle in navigating the traffic environment securely.\n\nTraffic Signs: A sign prohibiting left turns is located on the right, informing drivers, including the autonomous vehicle, that no left-hand turns should be attempted at the upcoming intersection. This restriction is factored into the vehicle's navigation strategy.\n\nTraffic Cones: On the left side of the intersection, traffic cones and construction barriers denote ongoing construction work or possible lane closures, which may compel the vehicle to adjust its trajectory to bypass the construction zone safely and remain on an appropriate driving path.\n\nOther Objects: Near the construction zone on the left, there are a pile of dirt and a wheelbarrow, suggesting the presence of a construction site and the potential for objects to encroach on the road, necessitating cautious monitoring by the vehicle. A pile of materials is also covered by a green tarp on the right side of the road, indicative of construction activities. While not directly impacting driving, it calls for increased alertness in this area due to possible unexpected activities.\n\nThe traffic lights and barriers categories display no items, indicating their absence in this specific snapshot of the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive cautiously and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Be prepared to stop or adjust your speed at any time depending on the traffic lights and vehicular movement. Due to roadside construction, lane blockages or other unexpected situations could occur; extra caution is required. Pay close attention to cyclists, ensuring a safe distance when changing lanes or giving way when necessary. Abide by traffic signs, and do not make U-turns or left turns at intersections. As the road may be slippery, exercise particular caution while driving.",
