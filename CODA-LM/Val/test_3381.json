This truck, although not moving, indicates potential sudden movement or the presence of construction workers that could affect the ego car's path.\n2. A yellow excavator is positioned perpendicular to the ego vehicle's lane, occupying part of the roadway and actively engaged in construction work. This excavator presents a physical obstruction and its operation could cause temporary or unpredictable changes in the state of the road, necessitating cautious driving or changes in the ego vehicle's trajectory.\n\nFor traffic signs, there are no visible traffic signs in the image. Therefore, the ego car must rely on situational awareness and typical road rules.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the image.\n\nRegarding traffic cones, no traffic cones are clearly visible in the image. Without cones marking construction zones, extra caution should be exercised.\n\nThere are makeshift barriers made up of construction materials scattered across the road, and a partially disassembled structure on the right side which narrows the drivable path.
