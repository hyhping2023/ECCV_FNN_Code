A small dog is visible in the pedestrian crossing on the left, which requires caution to avoid harming the animal. Additionally, an adult with another dog appears to be ready to step off the curb on the right, posing a potential hazard if they enter the road.\n\nDirectional arrows are painted on the road surface to guide lane directions for going straight and turning right, aiding in lane selection for the ego car's intended movement. \n\nA single orange traffic cone is visible beyond the crosswalk on the left, indicating a potential hazard or construction area, requiring the ego car to be prepared for changes in traffic patterns.\n\nTwo barriers are present: one separates the sidewalk from the road on the left, delineating the pedestrian area and preventing the ego car from veering off the road, and another raised median or island where pedestrians are standing, directing traffic flow and illustrating safe crossing points for pedestrians.\n\nThere are no other significant objects impacting the driving environment in this image."
