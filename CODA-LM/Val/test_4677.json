The parked vehicle serves as an indication that there might be pedestrians nearby or pose a risk of the vehicle unexpectedly pulling out into the traffic. \n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the image."

Extra caution should be exercised due to the presence of construction vehicles, which may involve shifting lanes away from the construction side if safe and legal. The ego car should also be prepared to stop or yield to construction workers or unexpected obstacles. The parked sedan should be monitored for any signs of movement that would indicate it is pulling into traffic, adjusting speed and position accordingly. Overall, defensive driving tactics should be adopted, giving the ego car enough time to respond to any unexpected events."
