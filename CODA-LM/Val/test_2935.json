These cones indicate that a section of the road or an entrance/exit has been closed to traffic, requiring drivers to avoid this area while driving.\n\nA yellow metal fence partially obstructs the right lane ahead, possibly indicating area closure, restriction, or ongoing construction. This suggests that workers or equipment might be near the driving path, so the vehicle should slow down and drive carefully.\n\nAdditionally, bright light emanating from a location on the right may cause glare or temporary visual impairment for drivers.

The navigation should be adjusted to avoid a series of traffic cones on the left and to drive carefully when approaching yellow obstacles to prevent nearby road workers or equipment. Moreover, strong lights on the right should be noted to avoid vision impairment on the reflective wet surface. In summary, it is recommended to stay highly alert and cautious.",

It is often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, though it can also be used to mark areas that are off-limits or to denote hazards. The presence of a traffic cone in the driving scenario suggests that the driver of the ego car should proceed with caution, watch for potential hazards or obstructions, and obey any other signs or directions that may be present around the work zone.",
