        "description and explanation": "In this traffic image, two categories of road users are observed: barriers and other objects. The barriers observed are extending along the left side of the road, delineating construction zones or restricted areas from the lanes of traffic. This setup indicates that the passage on the left side is restricted, advising autonomous vehicles to maintain their current lane and stay away from the obstacle to ensure safe navigation through the area.\n\nAdditionally, there are streetlights illuminating the road, which greatly enhance the visibility for nighttime driving. However, it is noted that the lighting, while beneficial for visibility, may introduce challenges such as glare which can affect the sensors of self-driving cars. This condition necessitates adjustments in the autonomous vehicles' sensing capabilities or speed to accommodate for the effect of glare and maintain safe driving conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive at a safe speed suitable for current conditions and stay within your lane. Remain alert and watch for potential hazards, such as vehicles entering from side roads or road users who may be hard to see. With obstacles present on the left, be prepared for possible lane narrowing or the presence of nearby workers, and adjust speed and lateral position accordingly when encountering new road conditions or obstacles. Maintain a safe speed to accommodate possible movements by pedestrians and cyclists, while closely monitoring left-side obstacles to avoid unexpected threats or changes in traffic patterns. Given that the road conditions are good, the vehicle can proceed normally but still needs to be vigilant for other potential road users or objects, such as road signs or vehicles ahead.",

Its highly visible color and reflective striping make it noticeable at night or in poor light conditions. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone indicates that there may be road work ahead, a hazard on the road, or a change in the normal traffic pattern. This should alert the ego car driver to reduce speed and proceed with caution, potentially preparing to stop or navigate around the obstruction.",
