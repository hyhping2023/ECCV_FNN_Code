The presence of this truck on the road would require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, as the mixer's size could obscure road hazards ahead.

Additionally, the ego car should be ready to change lanes if the cement truck continues to block the lane or if there are signs of it performing a maneuver that could impede traffic flow, ensuring to check blind spots and signal all lane changes well in advance. Prepare for possible evasive maneuvers if vehicles from adjacent lanes enter the ego car's lane. Continue to observe the traffic light while remaining vigilant for any changes in its state or unexpected occurrences at the intersection ahead. Monitor the construction vehicle closely for any sudden stops or changes in direction, and observe the pedestrians to ensure they do not enter the roadway."
