A yellow truck equipped with a crane arm is stationed on the right side of the road, engaged in some operations. This truck presents a temporary obstacle to the ego car because it potentially restricts the drivable path due to the ongoing work.\n\nAdditionally, the scene contains traffic control signs, specifically yellow circular signs with black arrows pointing right. These are situated on both sides of the road and indicate that drivers should deviate to the right due to possible lane obstructions ahead that are associated with the work area.\n\nFurthermore, the middle lane, as well as part of the left lane, are marked with red and white traffic cones arranged in a line. These cones serve to direct vehicular flow away from the middle of the road, essentially guiding drivers around the work zone and ensuring a safe distance from the operations taking place.\n\nLastly, there are green fences installed along the sidewalk on the right side. These fences define the perimeter of the work zone and alert pedestrians and drivers alike to maintain a safe distance from the construction activities."
