The visible brake lights indicate that the ego car should also prepare to slow down or stop due to potential traffic conditions ahead. Further down the road, there are several vehicles with their taillights on, pointing to a possible traffic congestion or reduced traffic flow, thus the ego car must ensure a safe following distance is maintained.\n\nAdditionally, there is a line of traffic cones on the right side of the driving lane, suggesting a construction zone or a lane closure and directing the ego vehicle to stay within the designated driving lane. Alongside the cones, there are metal barriers reinforcing the boundary and preventing the ego car from entering the closed-off area. Hence, these prompt the ego vehicle to adhere to lane restrictions and proceed with caution."

In the driving scenario, the traffic cone may indicate that the adjacent lane is closed for construction or there is a hazard ahead on the road.
