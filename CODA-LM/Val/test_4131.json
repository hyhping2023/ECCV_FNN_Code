This suggests it might be prepared to unload material or has not been properly secured. The size and position of the truck directly impact the ego car's visibility and following distance. Its raised bed suggests the potential for debris to fall onto the road if it is not properly secured, and proximity to the truck reduces the ego car's maneuverability and reaction time if the truck stops suddenly. Additionally, there is a traffic light showing red in front of the ego vehicle, indicating that the ego car must stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle is a heavy-duty transportation vehicle designed to carry construction materials. It has an open top, a robust structure, and usually has mechanisms for unloading materials such as gravel, sand, or demolition waste. The presence of this vehicle indicates nearby construction, which may result in limitations such as reduced lanes, debris on the road, or heavy traffic due to slower-moving vehicles. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or reduced speed. Drivers should also be cautious of debris that might fall from the vehicle and adjust their driving accordingly to avoid any road hazards.",

Furthermore, since the traffic light is red, the ego car must prepare to come to a complete stop at the intersection. Monitor the truck's brake lights for any indication of it slowing down or stopping. The ego car should remain alert for any potential changes in the truck's behavior and be ready to respond accordingly."
