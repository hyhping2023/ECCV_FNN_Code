The ego car should also remain vigilant for the motorcyclists weaving through traffic, ensuring to give them enough space and be ready to adjust speed or position if they make sudden movements. Monitor the left lane for a safe opportunity to merge if necessary. Stay alert for any road signs or changes in traffic signal ahead that may not be visible in the current frame."
