        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects that influence driving behavior, divided into various categories.\n\nThe vehicles category includes a brown SUV and a dark-colored vehicle. The brown SUV is partially parked on the sidewalk to the right of our vehicle, indicating a potential disregard for traffic rules and suggesting unpredictable behavior. Meanwhile, the dark-colored vehicle is parked on the left side, posing no active threat but warranting vigilance for any sudden door openings or movements into traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the scene.\n\nA traffic sign is observed on the right side of the road, which is a blue circular sign with a red border and a red cross in the center. This sign prohibits all vehicles from parking on this stretch of the road, which could influence driving decisions and behavior around parking.\n\nA barrier in the form of a portable metal railing is situated on the right side of the road behind the brown SUV. This railing marks a restricted area, potentially due to road construction or other limitations, indicating that vehicles are prohibited from crossing this boundary.\n\nOther objects identified include debris and white bags on the curb to the right of the autonomous vehicle. While these do not currently pose a direct threat to the driving route, they could potentially obscure smaller hazards or become hazards themselves if displaced by wind onto the roadway.\n\nThese findings from the traffic image are crucial for understanding the various factors that may affect autonomous driving behavior, including the need to monitor parked vehicles, adherence to traffic signs, awareness of potential barriers, and vigilance for unexpected obstacles or hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles, especially improperly parked SUVs, as their drivers might return and unpredictably move their vehicles. Always be alert to potential hazards on the right side of the road or pedestrians who may step onto the street from behind parked SUVs or obstacles. No action is currently needed for vehicles on the left unless there are signs of movement. Continue to be aware of debris on the road, but no need to adjust driving at this moment. Due to reduced road space and potential hidden dangers such as pedestrians emerging from behind parked vehicles, your vehicle should primarily slow down and proceed with caution. Furthermore, the \"No Parking\" sign indicates that your vehicle needs to look for an alternative parking spot. Due to the absence of movement from other vehicles or vulnerable road users, this situation affords your vehicle some time to plan the next move. It's important to consider making a turn safely without violating traffic laws or disrupting the flow of traffic, using rearview mirrors and indicators is essential. Your vehicle should maintain lane discipline while being prepared to gently steer clear of the parked SUV on the right. The driver should be aware of no entry or no parking signs and avoid parking or stopping on the left. There's no need for an immediate detour, but the presence of obstacles suggests that drivers should remain vigilant and aware of any signs of roadwork or upcoming changes in road conditions.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a portable barrier, typically used to temporarily block off an area or redirect traffic. It consists of multiple vertical posts connected by horizontal bars, and it may be used to cordon off a construction zone or an area of potential hazard. In this driving scenario, the presence of this barrier influences the future driving behavior by indicating that the ego car must not proceed through the area that the barrier is blocking, suggesting that an alternative route must be taken or caution should be used if it's an indication of a nearby hazard.",
