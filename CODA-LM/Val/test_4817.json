        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, a couple of vehicles and various other objects are present. There is a white SUV parked on the right side of the road, its orientation perpendicular to the traffic direction. This stationary SUV necessitates vigilance as its position close to the driving lane raises concerns about possible pedestrians appearing suddenly from behind it or a car door being opened into traffic.\n\nAnother vehicle, a white SUV, is coming from the opposite direction, positioned in the center of the road. This approaching SUV will require any oncoming traffic to decelerate and shift right to allow safe passage.\n\nWhile no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are observed in the image, there are additional objects of note. Black tires are scattered on the right side of the road, calling for drivers to keep a safe distance from the roadside and stay alert for any unexpected obstacles that may come into their path.\n\nMoreover, behind the scattered tires, there are varying materials such as yellow boards, resembling construction materials, which suggest there might be an ongoing construction project. Due to this, any autonomous driving systems should exercise increased caution, preparing for potential alterations to traffic patterns or the presence of construction workers and equipment on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, maintain a moderate speed, and keep a safe distance from the SUV ahead. Be prepared to adjust your driving trajectory in case the SUV stops suddenly or an obstacle appears from the right side due to a parked SUV. Pay attention to the road conditions for any changes due to debris, and stay alert for other road users who may not yet be in your line of sight. Due to the parked vehicles and the oncoming white SUV causing narrow road space, reduce speed and be ready to appropriately adjust your position to the right of the lane to ensure safe passage by the oncoming SUV. The presence of debris requires cautious driving and may require slight steering adjustments to avoid construction waste. In view of potential construction activities, be vigilant for sudden changes in road conditions, nearby workers who may emerge, or possible sudden signage. Stay alert for any sudden movements of parked vehicles or doors opening towards your driving path. In the absence of other road users or immediate road signs, continue to comply with general traffic rules and regulations applicable in residential areas.",
