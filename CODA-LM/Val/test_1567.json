Directly in front of our vehicle, there is a large orange truck with a crane-like machinery at the rear and a clearly visible license plate. This truck impacts our vehicle's ability to accelerate or change lanes due to its immediate presence.\n  2. In the neighboring left lane, slightly ahead, there is a black SUV with brake lights on. This suggests the SUV may be slowing down, which could influence our vehicle's decisions to change lanes or adjust its speed.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  A motorcyclist is located on the left side of our vehicle within the intersection area. Attention is required for potential lane changes or merging by the motorcyclist, affecting turning maneuvers.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  A sign indicating to keep right is installed on the traffic light pole across the intersection. This sign provides guidance on the permitted driving directions and affects the expected driving route.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  The green traffic light above the intersection signals that vehicles may proceed, indicating our vehicle has the right of way to pass through the intersection if the road is clear."

Since the light is green, proceed through the intersection when it is safe to do so, obey the mandatory right turn sign, and be aware that the left lane has been closed by traffic barriers. Continue driving carefully and be alert to any changes in the traffic ahead. Additionally, pay attention to pedestrian crosswalks in case pedestrians appear. This vehicle should also remain vigilant for potential actions of motorcyclists and monitor oncoming traffic to ensure safe passage through the intersection.",
