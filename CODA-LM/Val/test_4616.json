This truck's position and movement may impact the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes to the left and pose a potential blind spot issue or sudden lane change risk.\n   - A flatbed truck ahead, carrying two orange road rollers and occupying the center and right lanes of the highway. The size of this truck and its load could reduce visibility ahead for the ego car and require an increased following distance.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones:**\n   - Traffic cones are placed in the rightmost lane, creating a taper to guide traffic away from that lane. These cones indicate a lane closure or a potential hazard in the right lane, necessitating the ego car to avoid the right lane and be prepared for other vehicles merging.\n\n3. **Barriers:**\n   - Guardrails are running along both sides of the highway, with a solid metal barrier on the median strip. These barriers suggest the highway has limited access for entry and exit, directing traffic flow and enhancing safety by preventing vehicles from crossing into oncoming lanes."

It is usually used to create separation during road construction projects or automobile accidents, though it can also be utilized to mark out spaces during events. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that the ego car should remain alert and proceed with caution, possibly indicating that there is road work ahead, a lane closure, or an obstruction in the roadway. The driver of the ego car should prepare to slow down and adhere to any additional signage or signals that may accompany the cones for further instruction.",

Prepare for traffic that may be merging from the right lane due to the closure indicated by the traffic cones, and remain in the current lane or consider a lane change to the left if it's safe and necessary to avoid the coned-off area. Do not attempt to merge into the left lane immediately due to the presence of the blue truck and barriers, and avoid the right lane as it is closed off by traffic cones. Continue to monitor the road for any signs about potential road works ahead, keep an eye on the road ahead for any changes in traffic patterns or additional instructions, and stay alert for any changes in traffic patterns."
