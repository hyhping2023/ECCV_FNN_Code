Its size and slow speed could reduce visibility ahead and necessitate an increased following distance due to potential unpredictable maneuvers.\n2. **Black Sedan:** Located on the left side of the ego car in the adjacent lane, slightly ahead. Its proximity suggests it may merge into the ego car's lane or otherwise interact with the traffic around the ego car.\n3. **Green Sedan:** Positioned on the right side of the ego car in the adjacent lane, slightly behind. Being in a blind spot area, it might attempt to overtake or merge closer, necessitating caution and awareness.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. **Pedestrians:** Crossing the street ahead, to the right of the construction vehicle. Their presence requires the ego car to be ready to stop or slow down to ensure their safety.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. **Speed Limit Sign:** Located on the right-hand side indicating a limit of 70 km/h. The ego car should adhere to this speed limit when traffic conditions allow.\n2. **Directional Signs:** Positioned above the roadway, indicating route options and directions. These signs can inform the ego car's navigation system about upcoming route choices.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n1. **Green Traffic Lights:** Directly overhead across the intersection.

Caution should be exercised when considering any lane changes due to the proximity of the black sedan and the pedestrian activity near the green sedan. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car can proceed through the intersection but should do so at a speed that is safe and legal, staying alert for the potential actions of other road users. Additionally, be prepared to yield to pedestrians at the crosswalk and adhere to the speed limit while monitoring the green traffic light for any changes, especially considering the wet road conditions."
