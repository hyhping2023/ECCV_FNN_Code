These cars reduce the drivable width of the roadway and may obscure potential hazards such as pedestrians. An additional challenge is a small animal, possibly a dog, situated in the middle of the road ahead of the ego vehicle, which requires constant monitoring due to the potential for unpredictable movement and the jeopardy it could pose. This necessitates a readiness to stop if the need arises.\n\nFurthermore, there is some scattered debris or small objects on the road's surface. Combined with the poor lighting conditions, this increases the risk of tire damage or loss of vehicle control. As a result, it is advisable to proceed at a lower speed and maintain a heightened sense of awareness. The presence of shops and stalls on the right side of the road contributes to a higher likelihood of pedestrian activity near the curb, which could result in pedestrians unexpectedly entering the road, becoming a hazard for the moving traffic. \n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."
