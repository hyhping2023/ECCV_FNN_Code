This requires vigilance and potential deceleration due to possible passenger activity.\n   - Construction equipment is visible on the roadside to the left, indicating nearby construction activity, necessitating alertness for potential unexpected movements.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A cyclist is riding along the edge of the bus lane on the right. This requires increased caution due to the unpredictability of cyclists.\n   - Pedestrians are located next to the bus, indicating potential pedestrian activity around the bus area, requiring careful monitoring as they may enter the road unexpectedly.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Traffic cones are placed by the roadside ahead, indicating a hazardous area or road work. The ego car should proceed with caution and possibly reduce speed.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - A temporary barrier is on the left side, separating a construction area from the road. This suggests potential alterations in traffic flow and the presence of construction workers, requiring reduced speed and heightened alertness.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n   - Dustbins are situated on the right sidewalk, indicating an urban environment where the ego car must be aware of potential pedestrian and parked vehicle encounters, necessitating general urban driving awareness."
