        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene depicted, there are several noteworthy elements affecting the driving environment and behavior of an autonomous vehicle. \n\nFirstly, the vehicle category includes a light gray truck parked horizontally in the left lane, obstructing the path of oncoming vehicles. This position requires any approaching vehicle, including the autonomous one, to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision. Additionally, there's a dark-colored sedan parked on the right side ahead, aligned parallel to the travel direction. Parked vehicles like this sedan reduce the available lane width and pose a risk as they may unexpectedly move, demonstrating the necessity for continuous monitoring by the autonomous vehicle.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, a security guard is observed standing next to a roadside parked sedan, actively gesturing. This individual likely plays a role in directing traffic or could be signaling an impending road closure, thus demanding the autonomous vehicle's attention to possibly adhere to their instructions. Moreover, a motorcyclist is spotted behind a white truck on the opposite road side, who might change lanes or cross the road, potentially influencing the autonomous vehicle's traveling path.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, a green sign is present on the right road side, signifying an exit or a direction. This directional sign aids in guiding the driver but does not have an immediate impact on the autonomous vehicle's present maneuvering decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the scene encounters two yellow and black traffic cones placed on the road's right side, just behind the black sedan, marking a no-entry zone. This indicates that the area is prohibited for passage, directing the autonomous vehicle to seek an alternative route around it.\n\nNo traffic lights or barriers are observed in the depicted traffic scenario, nor are there additional objects of concern. This detailed observation and understanding of the environment are essential for the autonomous vehicle to navigate safely and efficiently through varying traffic conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or change lanes. Pay close attention to any instructions that may be given by security personnel. Your vehicle should also be prepared to yield to motorcyclists and cyclists who may navigate around the truck. If it is safe and the lane is clear, consider changing lanes to bypass the obstacle, following the guidance of traffic cones and the hand signals of security personnel. Drive carefully and be ready to stop or yield at any time according to the instructions of traffic officers. If the situation is clear and safe, your vehicle should change lanes to the left to avoid the area marked by obstructing vehicles and traffic cones. Maintain a low speed to accommodate any sudden changes in traffic conditions. Due to road conditions and delivery trucks parked facing oncoming traffic, your vehicle should reduce speed. If the truck moves, be prepared to stop or carefully navigate around the truck. Constantly observe pedestrians to predict and respond to any unexpected movements. Drive carefully, watching for potential movements of crowds and motorcyclists who may enter your driving path.",

            "description and explanation": "This item is a traffic cone, commonly used as a temporary traffic control device. It has a bright, easily visible color with reflective features to catch the attention of drivers. The cone signals drivers to be cautious and usually denotes an area where traffic may need to slow down, merge, or change direction due to road work, a traffic incident, or other roadway obstruction. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that the ego car should prepare to alter its course as directed by the signage or personnel on the road.",
