The truck has its rear lights illuminated, indicating it is active, and there is visible dirt on its rear. The truck's substantial size and slow speed could affect the ego vehicle's speed and following distance. Its proximity and size limit the ego vehicle's ability to overtake safely, necessitating a safe following distance. The illuminated brake lights suggest the truck is either slowing down or stopped, requiring immediate attention from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible in the distance on the right side of the image, showing green. This green traffic light indicates that the traffic in that direction is flowing normally, but it does not influence the ego car's lane due to its relative position."

It is characterized by its significant size, which may affect the visibility and maneuverability for vehicles traveling behind it. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, maintaining a safe following distance is essential to ensure there is ample time to react to the truck's actions, such as slowing down, stopping, or turning. Additionally, considering the truck's wider turning radius, the ego car should not attempt to overtake unless there is sufficient space and it is safe to do so.",

Due to the green light to the right, be aware of other vehicles that might enter the ego car's lane. Continue monitoring the road conditions and adjust driving behavior to night visibility and road surface. Monitor the truck's brake lights for signs of deceleration, indicating the need for the ego vehicle to also slow down. Do not attempt to overtake until there is a clear and safe opportunity to do so, such as an adjacent lane becoming available and free of traffic. Be ready to perform a safe lane change if an adjacent lane is clear and the maneuver is necessary to maintain traffic flow."
