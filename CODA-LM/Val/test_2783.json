There is an animal, possibly a dog, on the road ahead on the right side, crossing the street. This animal could pose a risk due to its unpredictable movements, such as changing direction or stopping suddenly. Visible in the distance on the right side is a green traffic light, indicating a go signal at an intersection ahead. This means the ego car should be ready to proceed through the intersection if necessary. Additionally, parked vehicles on both sides of the street narrow the effective width of the driving lane. These parked vehicles may impede maneuverability and obscure the view of potential hazards, like other road users or animals emerging from between the cars."

Use headlights if not already on to improve visibility and alert the animal of the car's presence. Stay vigilant for any sudden movements from the animal and be ready to react safely."
