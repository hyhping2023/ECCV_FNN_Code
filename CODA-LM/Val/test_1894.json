        "description and explanation": "The traffic image presents several key elements to be aware of. Firstly, there is a white SUV parked on the right side of the road with its rear towards the ego vehicle, and there's a person standing next to its open trunk. The stationary position of this vehicle, along with the proximity of a person, suggests a potential temporary obstacle or movement into the lane, necessitating caution from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the same individual is specifically noted to be standing near the open trunk of the parked SUV, slightly facing towards the ego vehicle. This positioning implies that the person may inadvertently move closer to the traffic lane or interact with objects that could encroach upon the road, posing potential hazards to passing vehicles.\n\nIn front of the parked SUV, a red traffic cone has been placed on the road. This cone is indicative of potential roadwork or hazards ahead, implying that drivers, including the ego vehicle, might need to change lanes or reduce their speed to safely navigate around the obstacle.\n\nFurthermore, yellow temporary barriers are located on the right side of the road, effectively separating it from a construction site or a landscaped area. These barriers serve as a visual indicator of a boundary or work zone, which could potentially alter driving conditions by influencing the roadway's width or the overall driving environment.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image, indicating a focus on the immediate physical obstructions and the presence of a pedestrian as factors influencing driving behavior in this scenario."
