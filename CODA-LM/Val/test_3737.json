        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, although there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present, there is an object of interest situated on the roadside. On the right side of the road, there appears to be a large reflective object that bears resemblance to a garbage bag. Such a reflective surface or object could create distractions at night, particularly in how it may catch the light. Additionally, this object has the potential to hide other hazards from view, including debris or animals, which could affect the driving behavior as the ego car's system may need to account for unforeseen obstacles."

            "description and explanation": "A plastic bag is a lightweight, flexible container made from plastic film. Depending on the location and context within the driving scene, a plastic bag can represent a minor road hazard. In this scenario, it appears to be on or near the ground, which could potentially be caught by the wind and carried into the path of the vehicle. The driver of the ego vehicle should monitor the bag's movement and be prepared to react if it enters the vehicle's trajectory to maintain safe operation, although it is unlikely to cause significant damage itself.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the poor lighting and visibility, the ego vehicle should reduce speed to allow more time to react to unexpected hazards. The headlights should be fully operational, and high beams can be used if there are no opposing traffic to enhance visibility. Stay vigilant for any signs of movement or reflective surfaces that may indicate the presence of pedestrians, animals, or other vehicles. The garbage bag observed should be cautiously passed, ensuring there is no hidden obstruction or hazard beneath or around it. Continue to monitor the road ahead for any further hazards that may be within the limits of the headlight illumination."
