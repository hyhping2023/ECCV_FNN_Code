        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles of interest. The first is a large construction vehicle positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the entire lane. This construction vehicle's size and location are significant as they may impede the ego vehicle's progress, potentially requiring it to decelerate or come to a complete stop if the construction vehicle is not moving or is moving slowly. Additionally, there is a yellow van to the left of the ego vehicle, situated in an adjacent lane and traveling in the same direction. The proximity and lateral movement of the van are critical factors for the ego vehicle, especially if there is a need to change lanes to the left. The ego vehicle must monitor the van's movements closely to ensure a safe lane change if necessary. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

It is designed for tasks that involve earthmoving, lifting, and hauling materials on construction sites. The presence of such a vehicle on the road typically implies a slower speed due to its size and function. For the ego car's future driving behavior, it is essential to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement associated with the construction vehicle's operation.",
