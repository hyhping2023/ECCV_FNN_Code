Among vehicles, there are several cars parked on the right side of our vehicle. These vehicles vary in color, ranging from light to dark shades, and some of them are partially obscured by shadows. The presence of parked vehicles represents a potential hazard since their doors might suddenly open, or passengers might exit the vehicles unexpectedly. Additionally, these parked vehicles reduce the available road space for moving traffic, potentially impacting the flow of traffic.\n\nFurthermore, on the same side of the road, near the parked cars, there is a visible pile of unidentified materials or debris. This pile of materials or debris, if extending into the road, could pose a risk to the traffic, creating a hazard that may require vehicles to maneuver unexpectedly to avoid it.\n\nIn this specific scene, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers identified. This summary captures all the provided information concerning the road users and objects in the scene, highlighting the situations that could affect driving behavior."
