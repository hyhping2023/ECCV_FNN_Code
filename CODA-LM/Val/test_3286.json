Its presence adds to the complexity of navigating the area and may indicate more activity nearby, such as people getting in and out of the car. Along the right side of the road, there is a line of parked construction vehicles, including a large concrete pump truck with its boom extended over the street. These vehicles signify ongoing construction work, which might obstruct traffic and present a hazard. Additionally, a white crane truck with an extended arm is particularly prominent, partially protruding into the rightmost lane. This crane truck necessitates particular care when being overtaken, as the overhanging parts may limit the usable width of the lane.\n\nThere are multiple orange traffic cones near the parked construction vehicles, indicating a designated work zone. These cones suggest construction activity ahead and could also delineate lane adjustments or closures, requiring cautious driving. \n\nAlongside these cones, makeshift barriers and construction debris, possibly made of concrete or rubble, are scattered on the right side of the road. These barriers and debris can narrow the drivable roadway and require the ego vehicle to maintain its lane and avoid maneuvers that may bring it too close to the right edge.\n\nLastly, there is construction debris or tools on the side close to the parked sedan, barely visible from the image's perspective. These could become obstacles if they are to fall or be moved onto the roadway. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights reported in the image."

Observe any temporary signage that may be present but not visible in the image for further instruction regarding lane changes or speed adjustments. The ego car should also be prepared for unexpected movements related to the construction activity and keep a lookout for any temporary traffic signs or signals that might be deployed further along the road."
