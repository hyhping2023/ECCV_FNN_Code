        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, thereâ€™s a notable presence of a vehicle evidenced by the red tail lights visible on the right side. These tail lights signal that there could be a vehicle positioned ahead, either in motion away from the observer or parked, but facing in the opposite direction of the ego car. This necessitates a cautious approach, with the readiness to adapt speed to accommodate the potential changes in the vehicle's status.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes two traffic lights that are illuminated in blue, which, under standard traffic light configurations, would generally be interpreted as green lights. This suggests that the ego car is granted the right of way, allowing it to continue moving through the intersection or past the traffic control point without hindrance.\n\nNo other road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists), traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects, have been identified in this scene. This information emphasizes the need for focused attention on the vehicle with the red tail lights and adherence to the signals given by the traffic lights for safe navigation through the area."

If the bus is stationary, it may be loading or unloading passengers, and the ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down and yield to pedestrians that may cross the street.",

Assuming the illuminated traffic lights are green, the car should continue through the intersection or control point if it is safe to do so, while monitoring for any unexpected movements from the vehicle indicated by the red tail lights. Additionally, the ego car's lighting system should be fully utilized to improve visibility for the driver and to alert other road users of its presence."
