        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario provided, the ego car is surrounded by several road users and objects:\n\nVehicles:\n- A white van is positioned directly in front of the ego car in the center lane, with both vehicles moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to keep a safe distance as the van might slow down or stop suddenly, or it may change lanes, requiring the ego car to be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes as well.\n- To the right, multiple vehicles are moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles might change lanes, hence the ego car should anticipate such movements for maintaining safety while making lane changes or adjusting speed.\n- In the left lane, a car has passed the ego car and others are following, all moving in the same direction. It's crucial for the ego car to be aware of these vehicles for maintaining lane discipline and to make safe lane changes as needed.\n- A bus is stationary on the adjacent right lane, possibly at a bus stop, indicating that it may be picking up or dropping off passengers. This could lead to pedestrians crossing the street, prompting the ego car to be ready to yield.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- Pedestrians are present on the sidewalk to the right, with one individual in a red top seemingly preparing to cross the street. Given they are near a crossing zone, the ego car should be alert and prepared to stop to give way, ensuring pedestrian safety.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- No traffic signs are mentioned in the given data.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- The traffic light is hidden from this viewpoint, suggesting that the ego car driver will need to discern its status closer to the intersection to make informed driving decisions.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Traffic barriers, characterized by red and white coloring, are placed on the left side of the road, signifying a closed lane or construction area. These barriers oblige the ego car to stay in its current lane, as merging left is not an option.\n\nBarriers:\n- Red barriers are set up along the left side of the road, causing a reduction in available traffic lanes. The barriers indicate potential lane closures or roadwork, requiring the ego car to potentially adjust its lane position and maintain a safe distance from the barriers.\n\nOther Objects:\n- Dustbins and posts are located on the right sidewalk, posing no immediate threat to the ego car if they remain stationary. Nonetheless, these objects should be monitored.\n- Streetlight poles and trees are present along the sidewalk, which do not directly impact the roadway. They form part of the regular road environment and will only influence driving decisions if they were to obstruct the roadway.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the various static and dynamic elements that the ego car should consider when making driving decisions in real-time to ensure safety on the road."

Do not attempt to merge left due to the traffic barriers. Monitor the vehicles in the left lane for possible merges, and be prepared to stop or slow down due to the bus potentially obstructing vision of crossing pedestrians. It should also keep to the lanes not obstructed by barriers and stay alert for any pedestrians that might enter the road. Lastly, regular checks on mirror and side awareness are advised to ensure no vehicles are in the blind spots or are overtaking unsafely."
