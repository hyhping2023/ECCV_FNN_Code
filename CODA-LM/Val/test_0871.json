        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are notable elements worth describing:\n\nVulnerable Road Users: There are people inside a tent-like structure on the right, possibly a checkpoint or a service area. Their proximity to the driving lanes warrants cautious driving, due to the risk of pedestrians potentially entering the lane.\n\nTraffic Signs: Several traffic signs are visible. On the left, there is a sign indicating a nearby parking area coupled with a no left turn sign, and directly ahead, a speed limit sign imposes a limit of 15 kilometers per hour. Additionally, in the center and on the right of the picture, two speed limit signs display a limit of 20 kilometers per hour. These signs require the vehicle to adjust its speed accordingly and prohibit turning left at the intersection.\n\nBarriers: The scene includes temporary, movable barriers on the right side that delineate the checkpoint area, and a fixed railing on the left, separating the road from the sidewalk. These barriers limit the driving space, highlighting the need to remain within the designated lane.\n\nOther Objects: A stationary vehicle is present on the other side of the barrier, potentially affecting road width and traffic flow. It's important for vehicles to be aware of possible movements of this car as it may enter the traffic lane. Additionally, there is a sentry box on the right side, which, while not directly affecting the driving path, necessitates awareness of possible activities around this structure.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or vehicles directly affecting the driving behavior of the ego car were observed in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the uncertainty and potential risks associated with pedestrians near the checkpoint area, self-driving vehicles should reduce their speed to the maximum limit of 15 km/h as indicated by the sign. Avoid making left turns at intersections, maintain lane discipline while passing through the checkpoint, and be prepared for the possibility of people or vehicles entering the driving lane from the checkpoint area. Be ready to maneuver around tents and obstacles, and do not enter restricted parking zones. Exercise heightened caution due to the slippery road surface. While adhering to the newly designated speed limit of 20 km/h, drive carefully. Anticipate the presence of pedestrians around tents and booths. Be prepared to navigate around the red and white barriers and adjust your route according to the road closures or detours they indicate.",
