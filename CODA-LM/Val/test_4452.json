They should maintain a safe distance from electric bicycles and watch for any signs of movement from the red SUV. Self-driving cars should also be ready to respond to road signs' instructions or warnings. Moreover, the driver should be prepared to navigate around any obstacles or follow detour directions as indicated by construction signs. At intersections without signal control, self-driving cars should prepare to yield to users who may not be immediately visible and proceed with caution.",
