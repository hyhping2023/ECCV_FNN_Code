The close proximity and size of this truck may obstruct the view of the road ahead and limit maneuverability for the ego vehicle.\n\nTo the left of the truck, there’s a partially occluded white car with its brake lights on, indicating it may be slowing down or stopped. The presence of this car suggests potential traffic congestion or a traffic signal ahead, prompting vehicles to stop.\n\nOther partially visible vehicles in adjacent lanes appear stationary or moving slowly, consistent with congested traffic conditions. This high-traffic situation requires the ego vehicle to navigate carefully and be prepared for sudden stops.\n\nA small silver car is visible in the left side mirror, positioned in the adjacent lane behind the ego car. This car might attempt to overtake, requiring the ego vehicle’s awareness of its presence.\n\nAhead in the rightmost lane, there is a white car parallel to the truck within the ego vehicle’s field of vision, which may influence lane choice for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light in the distance is displaying a red light on the right side of the picture. The red traffic light indicates that the vehicles in the ego vehicle's lane must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding."

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the vehicles in adjacent lanes for any indications of lane changes or merging that could affect its trajectory. Given the traffic congestion, the ego car should proceed with caution when the light turns green, anticipating potential delays in the traffic flow. Maintain a safe distance from the concrete mixer truck, monitor the traffic light, and prepare to stop if the signal remains red. Keep an eye on the side mirrors for the silver car in the left lane, and be prepared for potential lane-changes from the vehicles around. Resume driving once the traffic light turns green, ensuring that the path ahead is clear and proceeding with caution due to reduced visibility."
