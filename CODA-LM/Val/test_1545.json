Although the pedestrian is not attempting to cross the road, the ego car should monitor their movement for any sudden changes.\n2. A blue circular sign indicating a mandatory direction to the right for a bike lane or path is also present on the right side of the road. This sign suggests an increased likelihood of cyclists' presence, requiring the ego vehicle to be aware of this specific instruction for cyclists.\n3. Orange traffic cones outline a buffer zone around a work area on the right lane. These cones indicate a lane obstruction, necessitating vehicles in the right lane to merge left.\n4. Concrete barriers are positioned on the right, partially blocking the right lane or shoulder. These barriers represent an obstruction and reduce the available lane width, calling for caution and possible merging to the left.\n5. Additionally, there is a temporary roadwork barrier sign on the sidewalk to the right. This sign indicates ongoing roadwork ahead, necessitating reduced speed and increased vigilance.\n6. Lastly, a dustbin is located on the sidewalk on the right. While it is not obstructing the road, it does indicate an urban area that could have unpredictable elements, such as pedestrians or cyclists."
