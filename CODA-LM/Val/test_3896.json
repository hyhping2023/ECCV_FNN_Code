It has a visible load at the back and appears to be stationary or moving at a low speed. Due to the truck's presence, the ego car must adjust its speed or change lanes to keep a safe following distance and be ready for a potential stop.\n\nAdjacent to the road and above the truck, there's a blue rectangular signboard signifying the presence of an upcoming parking or rest area. This indicates that the ego car should be vigilant as vehicles in front might reduce speed to enter the area. Additionally, a yellow and black striped sign is posted to the left of the truck, possibly denoting road work or similar hazards ahead, prompting the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution. There's also a directional sign mounted on a pole above the truck, hinting at a right turn or merge that the ego car should prepare for.\n\nOn the right side of the road, multiple traffic cones form a visual barrier along the driving lane's edge, signifying possible roadwork or hazards nearby. The ego car must navigate this section carefully and be ready to merge left if the lane ahead becomes obstructed.\n\nA makeshift barrier with red and white stripes is observed on the left, signaling a no-entry or restricted area and ensuring the ego car remains in its current lane or consider safely changing lanes to the right if needed.\n\nFurther along, an array of other objects is seen. A foldable stand with a service information board in red, white, and blue is placed on the roadside ahead of the cones, potentially offering additional directions or warnings about the road conditions ahead. Moreover, there is a portable road work sign on a stand to the right of the lane, reinforcing the road work or lane merging conditions ahead, thus advising the ego car to slow down and exercise caution."
