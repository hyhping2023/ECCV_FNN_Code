However, there are bright orange traffic cones with reflective white bands and yellow caution tape lined up along the lane edge. These cones indicate that a section of the road is either closed or undergoing maintenance, and they guide vehicles to stay within the operational lanes and away from potential hazards. Additionally, there are yellow and black striped barriers on the right edge of the road, which likely indicate a closed-off area or ongoing roadwork. These barriers serve to protect road users from entering a hazardous or restricted area, ensuring a safe passage through the designated lanes. There are no other objects reported in the scene."
