        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there are three vehicles of interest. A blue car is parked on the left side of the road, facing our vehicle, which reduces the width of the usable lanes for safe passage. Similarly, a dark-colored vehicle is also parked on the left side ahead, facing the same direction as our vehicle, which presents the same issue of reduced lane width and the potential for the vehicle to move unexpectedly. Additionally, the rear part of the blue sedan reveals another vehicle, which is partially obstructed and cannot be fully described. Caution is advised when overtaking the blue sedan to account for the possibility of the hidden vehicle moving into the road space.\n\nOn the right side of the road, near the parked blue car, there is a small group of dogs. The presence of animals near the roadside is a concern as they may behave unpredictably and could enter the driving lane, posing a risk to traffic. Autonomous vehicles must be ready to stop or slow down to ensure safety.\n\nThere are also other objects present. A utility pole with several wires attached is situated on the right side of the road, near the parked blue car. While it does not directly affect driving behavior, it is important to be aware of any potential debris or obstacles that might be near such structures. Additionally, various debris, including plastic coverings and construction materials, are scattered along the roadside. These materials could potentially enter the roadway, and self-driving vehicles should be vigilant and prepared to respond to any debris that may block the road.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be reported."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the potential hazards posed by animals and parked cars, as well as oncoming traffic from the opposite lane, your vehicle should reduce speed. Remain alert to any movements of dogs or the opening of car doors in the blue vehicle. Furthermore, the lack of road markings and the rural setting suggest that extra caution is necessary in this area. Maintaining a safe distance from parked vehicles and reducing driving speed will provide more reaction time for your vehicle to respond to unforeseen events ahead. Proceed with caution and keep a close watch on vehicles parked on the left side. Slow down appropriately to anticipate potential movements of partially visible vehicles. Maintain a greater lateral distance from parked vehicles to navigate narrowing roads and be prepared to avoid possible obstacles. Since there are no visible traffic signs or lights at the scene, no specific maneuvers are required for this.",
