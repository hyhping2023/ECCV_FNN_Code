        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, there are several elements affecting driving behavior:\n\n1. **Vehicles**: \n   - A white car is traveling in the left lane in the same direction as our vehicle. Although the car is at a certain distance, it might change lanes or slow down, necessitating a reaction from our vehicle.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A blue rectangular sign on the right side of the road indicates the direction and shows that there is an overpass ahead. This suggests an intersection where the vehicle can either go straight or take the overpass, requiring the driver to be clear about the route and prepared for lane changes or navigation decisions.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Traffic cones are placed on the right side of the far-right lane, indicating that the lane ahead is closed. This requires drivers in the right lane to merge left and serves as a warning for safe merging in advance.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - A metal barrier with a diamond pattern extends along the left side of the road, separating the roadway from the pedestrian area and adjacent buildings. This permanent barrier protects pedestrian areas and buildings from vehicular traffic impact.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n   - There is a pole with a device, possibly a traffic surveillance camera, on the right side of the road. This stationary object reminds drivers to maintain correct driving behavior due to surveillance presence.\n   - A small building is located behind the traffic cones on the right side of the road. While it does not directly affect the vehicle's driving path, it is part of the roadside environment and should be recorded by the autonomous driving system for situational awareness."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the white car in the left lane. If you are in the right lane, prepare to merge into the left lane due to the lane closure indicated by the traffic cones ahead. Choose the correct lane in advance to follow the route indicated by the signs, and drive carefully. Stay alert and watch for any signs that the lane patterns may change due to traffic cones and obstacles. If the navigation data suggests taking a flyover, prepare to change lanes in advance, check that the passage is clear and signal to other road users. Maintain a safe driving speed to react to any unexpected situations that may arise due to potential road works.",

It also implies that there may be roadwork, an accident, or some form of obstruction ahead, requiring the ego vehicle to proceed with increased awareness and caution.",
