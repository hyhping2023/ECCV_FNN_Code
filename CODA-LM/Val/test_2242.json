Its tail lights are illuminated, suggesting that the car may either be stationary or preparing to enter the traffic flow. This poses a potential hazard, especially if it decides to move into the lane of the ego car or if there are passengers who might open doors or disembark unexpectedly. Further ahead is a second vehicle, a darker car, also parked on the right side of the road, with its tail lights on. This vehicle reduces the amount of drivable space available to the ego car and may necessitate adjustments in the path planning for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are lighting from buildings and a possible signboard above the parked vehicle on the right side of the image. Although these objects do not have a direct impact on the ego car's driving path, they could potentially cause distractions or create reflections, which should be monitored but are not considered physical impediments in this context.\n\nOther categories like vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not have any items listed in this image, suggesting they are not present or not relevant in this scenario."
