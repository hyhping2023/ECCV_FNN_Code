The truck, recognizable by its rectangular cargo area and taillights, is traveling in the same direction, slightly to the left of our vehicle.

It may be necessary to dim your lights to avoid glare and to reduce the glare for oncoming drivers. High beams should be avoided to prevent dazzling other drivers.",

Due to its size and the nature of construction activities, such a vehicle can affect traffic flow by moving slower than regular traffic, taking up more space on the road, or potentially stopping to perform work-related tasks. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, anticipate potential movements of the construction vehicle, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to safely navigate around it.",
