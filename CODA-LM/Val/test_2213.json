This limits the usable width of the road and indicates curb space that must be navigated carefully.\n  - A white sedan is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane, indicating the lane has or had moving traffic, requiring the ego vehicle to follow at a safe distance and be prepared to adjust speed.\n  - Another white car is further ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction. While it currently does not affect the ego vehicle, its presence indicates traffic ahead.\n  - A white car is diagonally ahead on the right, partially in the driving lane with its brake lights on, suggesting it might be preparing to park or merge into traffic, which could affect the ego vehicle's flow.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - Directional signs on the left side signal a turn or junction ahead, indicating that the ego vehicle should be prepared for potential changes in traffic flow or lane changes.\n  - A blue rectangular sign with a white arrow points to a detour or alternate route on the left, suggesting that the usual route might be unavailable and adjustments to the planned route might be necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - Two sets of traffic lights are visible, with the light for the ego vehicle's lane showing green, allowing vehicles to move forward. However, the ego vehicle should remain cautious, especially because of the white car ahead in the driving lane that may act unpredictably.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Orange traffic cones line the right side up to the construction barriers, defining a path the ego vehicle must follow. These cones indicate areas off-limits for driving and guide traffic flow.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Temporary construction barriers enclose an area on the right side of the road, with a crane visible in the background, indicating ongoing construction work. These barriers represent a physical obstruction, necessitating cautious driving and reduced speed.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - A tree on the right side of the road helps define the edge of the roadway, marking the boundaries of the driving lane, though it does not pose a direct influence on driving behavior."

While approaching the area with the directional signs, the ego car should stay in the appropriate lane to follow the indicated route, and remain vigilant for any unexpected maneuvers by other road users due to the indicated detour. The ego vehicle should be prepared to follow detour signs and navigate through the defined path without crossing into the restricted construction zone. Anticipating potential stops or slow-moving traffic ahead due to the construction area would also be prudent."
