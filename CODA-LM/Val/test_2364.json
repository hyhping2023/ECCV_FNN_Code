The presence of the truck is significant as it is partially blocking the adjacent lane, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a height limit sign on the left side before the checkpoint that indicates a maximum vehicle height of 3 meters. This is an important detail for the ego vehicle to consider if it is taller than the specified limit. Additionally, a gantry over the road displays a green arrow for the lane going straight and a red 'X' over the left lane, indicating that the left lane is closed and directing the ego vehicle to use the open lane.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a green light for going straight and a red light for turning left, which is directly above the lane for the ego car. The ego car is allowed to proceed straight but should remain cautious, especially if other vehicles or road users might ignore the red light for the left turn.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are positioned to the left, guiding traffic away from an area that is either under construction or not accessible. These cones are a clear indication for the ego car to stay to the right and avoid the restricted zone.\n\nYellow and black striped barriers are located on both sides of the toll booth lane, serving to separate the lanes and direct the flow of traffic. The ego car must adhere to these barriers to navigate the toll area correctly.\n\nLastly, there is a yellow flag on the right side of the road, which could be signaling construction or serving as a warning. This flag is a prompt for drivers to exercise caution and be prepared for potential changes in the driving environment or upcoming hazards."
