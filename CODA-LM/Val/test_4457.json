The truck's cab is not visible, suggesting it is moving in the same direction as our car. The size and length of the truck, along with potential blind spots, may impact our vehicle's ability to change lanes or overtake safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional road sign with a blue background on the right side of the image. While this sign provides direction and distance information, it does not necessitate immediate action from the driver.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light is visible in the distance, rising above the truck and displaying an orange (amber) signal. This indicates that the light will soon turn red, and if the vehicle cannot safely clear the intersection before the change, the driver should be ready to stop."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please drive carefully and maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, being mindful of its potential blind spots. As the traffic light is displaying amber, it may soon turn red, so be prepared to stop. Since the actual route signs are unclear, pay attention to roadside signs to change direction or adjust lanes in a timely manner. At the same time, considering the slippery road conditions, adjust your speed appropriately to prevent skidding or hydroplaning. As the truck is occupying part of the lane and the traffic light has turned amber, the driver should slow down and be prepared to stop at the red light. If necessary, the driver should be ready to adjust lane positions to safely overtake the truck or wait for the truck to fully enter its lane.",

Its presence on the road indicates that there may be construction work nearby, or that the vehicle is in transit to or from a construction site. The ego car must maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards, such as the unexpected movement of the construction vehicle or debris falling from it. Due to the large size and heavy load of such vehicles, the ego car should be prepared for the construction vehicle to make wider turns and be extra cautious when overtaking.",
