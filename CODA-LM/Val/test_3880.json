These cones suggest that the vehicle needs to adjust its route to avoid the closed lanes or other obstacles on the road.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier with yellow and red stripes is positioned ahead, right next to a pavilion, likely indicating the entrance or exit of a controlled area such as a parking lot. This barrier controls access to the area, and autonomous vehicles must stop or slow down, as they cannot pass without permission or without making a payment.\n\nMoreover, there is a pavilion located at the center of the picture, illuminated by lights, possibly a security or toll booth of a parking area. The presence of this type of booth usually indicates a transaction point or security checkpoint, thus autonomous vehicles should be prepared to stop when needed and interact with human operators."

Drive on the left to avoid areas marked by traffic cones and pay attention to signs on the right that may indicate directions or route changes. The presence of toll booths suggests that vehicles should be ready to interact with personnel or engage in transactions or security checks at inspection stations. Also, be aware of vehicles parked on the right side to prevent them from entering the flow of traffic.",
