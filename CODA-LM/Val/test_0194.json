On the opposite lane, there are multiple vehicles, some of which are waiting at the intersection while others are in motion. The autonomous vehicle must take these vehicles into account to time turns correctly and adhere to right-of-way rules.\n\nThere are two motorcyclists in the vicinity of the car. One, wearing black and red, is riding perpendicular to the right side of the car, necessitating caution and readiness for any sudden movements due to the motorcyclist's vulnerability and potential for unpredictable actions. The second motorcyclist, dressed in blue, is slightly ahead on the right and traveling in the same direction as the car, also requiring close attention.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a \"No Through Road\" sign ahead, which dictates the maneuvers allowed at the intersection and must be followed. Additionally, a square blue sign with a white upward arrow is positioned above the central traffic light, indicating that vehicles in this lane are required to proceed straight.\n\nThe traffic light at the intersection is red, signaling the vehicle to stop and wait until it turns green to continue.\n\nOn the right side of the road leading to the intersection, traffic cones are set up, causing the lane to narrow. This could indicate a construction zone or other hazards, and the autonomous vehicle should proceed with caution and possibly adjust its lane positioning.\n\nLastly, there is a red digital LED display on the right side, which may show the countdown to the traffic light change. This allows the autonomous vehicle to anticipate the light change and prepare to move when it is safe to do so.\n\nThere are no barriers present in the image, and no other objects are mentioned besides the LED display."

    "driving_suggestion": "When the vehicle is at a red light intersection, it must come to a complete stop at the pedestrian crossing and comply with the traffic light signals. Due to the narrowing of the road caused by traffic cones, the vehicle should remain alert, make appropriate adjustments to any changes in the road layout, and change lanes if necessary. Additionally, the vehicle should monitor the movements of motorcyclists and yield when appropriate to ensure safety. Once the traffic light turns green, the vehicle can proceed through the intersection with caution, following the directions indicated by traffic signs and considering the directions shown by overhead road signs.",
