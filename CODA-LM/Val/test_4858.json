Additionally, there is a motorcycle coming out from a shop on the right, with two riders on board. The motorcycle is in a position where it might enter the main flow of traffic, which could affect the driving path of the ego car.\n\nThere are also two pedestrians in dark clothing crossing the street from the left to the right carrying goods. These individuals are directly in the path of the vehicle, and the ego car must yield to allow them to cross safely.\n\nOn the right side of the street, in front of the parked car and motorcycle, several traffic cones are set up in a line. The cones indicate a separation of the driving lane from a blocked or restricted area, likely for construction or maintenance, requiring the ego car to stay clear from this section of the road.\n\nLastly, there are groups of tires placed on the side of the road along the parked vehicle and in front of some roadside stalls. The tires could represent a temporary road modification or obstacle, and the ego car should be prepared for potential maneuvers around these objects if they encroach upon the driving lane.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image."

Proceed with caution, maintaining a lower speed due to wet road conditions and the presence of pedestrians and a motorcyclist. Be prepared to perform evasive maneuvers should pedestrians step into the road or if obstacles appear in the driving path. Keep a safe distance from the motorcyclist as sudden changes in their trajectory are possible."
