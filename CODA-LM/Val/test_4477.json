The first vehicle is a white car parked on the right side of the road, facing our vehicle. It is stationary and appears to be unmanned. The presence of this vehicle reduces the available road width and may obscure pedestrians or other hazards from view. The second vehicle is a darker-colored car parked on the left side, facing the direction of our car. Its headlights are off, which suggests that the vehicle is parked. This vehicle could obstruct its own line of sight and maneuverability, posing a challenge, especially when there are oncoming vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are various objects and debris scattered around, some of which are on the lane of the self-driving car and others beside it. These obstacles are a hazard that autonomous vehicles must navigate around to avoid damage and ensure safety. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to poor lighting conditions and the presence of motorcycles, our vehicle should slow down. The driver should be prepared to stop or safely overtake the motorcycles, ensuring there is enough clearance. Additionally, the driver should stay alert to the potential movements of parked vehicles and be ready for other road users that might be obscured by them. If a lane change is needed, using headlights or even hazard lights to overtake motorcycles can warn oncoming traffic of our presence in the adjacent lane. Our vehicle should come to a complete stop and wait for pedestrians to clear the road. Once pedestrians and any potential hazards no longer obstruct the path, our vehicle should proceed with caution, considering the darkness and possible limited visibility or further unexpected obstacles. It is also advisable to keep a safe distance from vehicles parked on the right to prevent issues should their doors open or if the vehicle starts moving. Slow down immediately, turn on hazard lights, and prepare to stop or carefully navigate around pedestrians, ensuring not to make any sudden movements that may startle them or cause an accident. Use the vehicle's lights to increase visibility and alertness among other road users. If visibility is too low to safely maneuver around debris, our vehicle should come to a safe stop and only continue driving when the road is clear and passable.",
