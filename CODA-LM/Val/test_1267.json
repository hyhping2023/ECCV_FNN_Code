Firstly, an orange forklift is directly in front of the ego car in the same lane, moving in the same direction with an operator seated inside. This requires the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance and pass safely. Additionally, a black sedan is parked on the left side of the road, partially obstructing the adjacent lane, which could affect the ego car's decision to change lanes if needed.\n\nThere are bicycles parked along the sidewalk on the left. While no cyclists are currently visible, the ego car should be cautious and monitor for any cyclists that may enter the road.\n\nNo traffic signs or traffic lights are visible in the image affecting the immediate decisions of the ego car. This suggests that the ego car should proceed based on standard road rules and real-time traffic conditions.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right of the ego vehicle, a series of spherical bollards ensure the vehicle maintains a safe distance from pedestrian areas. Additionally, there are various bicycles and parked electric scooters adjacent to these bollards, which further reduce the available space for maneuvering but do not pose an immediate dynamic risk."

The presence of this vehicle suggests ongoing construction activity nearby, and its position on the road could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by requiring the driver to reduce speed, maintain a safe distance, or possibly alter the intended route to navigate safely around the construction area while being mindful of workers or unexpected obstacles.",

Monitoring for potential actions by pedestrians around the parked bicycles and being ready to respond to any changes in the traffic light ahead should be a priority. The ego car should signal appropriately and check for other vehicles in the adjacent lane before attempting any maneuver. Caution should be taken to stay within the driving lane and avoid entering the pedestrian area marked by the bollards. If the adjacent lane to the left is clear and it's legal and safe to do so, the ego car may change lanes to pass the forklift. The driver should also monitor for any potential movement from the parked sedan and the bicycles and electric scooters parked on the side to ensure they do not suddenly enter into the path of the vehicle."
