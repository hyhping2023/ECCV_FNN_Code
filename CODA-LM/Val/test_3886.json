It is important to keep an eye on this pedestrian even though they are moving away from the vehicle, as they might decide to cross the road or change their movement unexpectedly. Additionally, there is a traffic sign on a pole to the left side of the vehicle. The details of the sign are not clear from the image, but it is crucial for the driver to stay alert to any potential information it might convey that could influence driving behavior. There are no vehicles, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that need to be considered."
