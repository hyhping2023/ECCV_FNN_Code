This presence is significant as it may impact the traffic flow of the adjacent lanes, leading to the possibility of vehicles changing lanes with little notice. Consequently, there is a need to adjust the driving route to navigate safely around the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users, specifically pedestrians or workers near the construction site on the right sidewalk. These individuals could potentially enter the roadway, which necessitates that the autonomous vehicle should continuously monitor them and be ready to yield if necessary.\n\nSignage related to the construction is in place as well. A construction sign indicates the ongoing roadwork ahead. This serves as a caution to drivers, including the autonomous car, to lower their speeds and remain alert to possible obstacles or alterations in normal traffic patterns as a result of the construction activities.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects indicated in the data that would affect driving behavior for this image."
