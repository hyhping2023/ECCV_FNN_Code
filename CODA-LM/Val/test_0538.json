Two other road workers are on the right side of the road, one close to the travel lane and another further to the side, both focused on their work. Their proximity necessitates that the ego car slows down and passes with caution. Another worker is on the left, sweeping the street close to the curb, and while less likely to step into the travel lane, vigilance is still required due to potential for unexpected movement.\n\nThere are no visible traffic signs in the immediate vicinity that provide instructions or warnings, indicating no immediate actions are required, but caution is still advised due to the presence of road workers.\n\nYellow and black traffic cones are placed intermittently along both sides of the lane dividers, signaling potential hazards or roadwork.

It is important to be observant of any sudden movements from the workers and maintain a lower speed as recommended by roadwork signage, if present, or as per general safe driving practices in areas with pedestrians."
