This suggests that the truck might be undergoing maintenance, which could affect traffic flow by requiring vehicles to slow down or stop.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a metal guardrail extends, separating the lane from the adjacent ground. This guardrail defines the boundaries of the road and restricts the safe driving area for the vehicle. Additionally, a green metal guardrail extends along the left side of the road, serving a similar role by ensuring that vehicles remain in the correct lane.\n\nIn front of the right-side guardrail, there is a red and white striped pillar which serves as a marker or warning sign, possibly indicating a curve or intersection ahead. Along both sides of the road, trees of various sizes and canopy densities are lined up. While these trees do not directly impede traffic, they may pose risks such as falling branches, especially under changing conditions like strong winds."

Stay alert, as green traffic lights and roadside activities indicate that the traffic scene may change rapidly. Observe red conical objects to look for signs of road work that may affect lane discipline or safety. This vehicle should remain vigilant for vehicles that may merge into our lane, adjusting speed according to the potential indications of upcoming traffic signs once they become visible. Moreover, vehicles should stay within their lanes, using markings and guardrails for guidance.",
