These vehicles are primarily white and come in various models and sizes. They present an impact on the driving behavior of the ego car by reducing the usable width of the roadway, which can potentially obstruct the view of both pedestrians and moving vehicles that may be preparing to merge into the traffic. Furthermore, the presence of these parked cars poses an additional risk of doors being opened into the path of the ego car. No other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are observed in the image."

The presence of this car necessitates caution by the driver of the ego car to avoid any collisions or to be aware of potential movement from this car if it is not parked but temporarily stationary.

Be vigilant for any sudden movements from between parked vehicles such as pedestrians or animals that may be hard to see. Additionally, because of the poor lighting and lack of visible lane markings, maintain a safe distance from parked cars to allow for reaction time in case of an unexpected event. Given the lack of visible traffic control devices and road users in the image, the ego vehicle should rely on general traffic rules for navigating the area safely."
