These cones typically signal changes to normal traffic patterns, such as lane closures or shifts, and the ego car must proceed with caution.\n\nMetal barriers are placed beside the traffic cones, further indicating a cordoned-off work area or lane closure. These barriers suggest that the ego car may need to navigate carefully and possibly merge left if the lane is ending.\n\nLastly, there is yellow construction machinery, likely an excavator, beyond the barriers, engaged in construction activity. This machinery could be moving or causing temporary distractions, and heavy machinery near the road can be distracting and may cause unexpected hazards, such as debris or workers close to the travel lane.
