        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, parked cars are visibly positioned on both sides of the narrow street. Notably, the nearest parked car on the right partially obstructs the driving lane. Such positioning is crucial because doors could suddenly open, or the vehicles might unexpectedly depart, presenting risks that demand careful driving from the autonomous vehicle to ensure safety. Additionally, there are small, indistinct objects in the middle of the road, which could be debris or reflections. Consequently, these require the attention of the autonomous vehicle to avoid potential road hazards that might necessitate evasive action or could otherwise damage the vehicle."
