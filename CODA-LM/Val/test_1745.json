The barrier is described as having a red and white color scheme, and it spans across the entire width of the roadway. Key to its design, reflective stripes are integrated to enhance visibility, especially critical under low light conditions or at night. The presence of this barrier serves a critical function, signifying that the road is currently closed to traffic. This situation directly impacts the driving behavior of the ego car, necessitating an alternative route since the vehicle cannot proceed forward on its current path. Other typical road users or elements such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and miscellaneous objects are notably absent in this image, making the barrier the focal point that dictates the immediate required adjustments in driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "A barrier is an obstacle used to block access through a road, path, doorway, or other passage, typically composed of plastic, metal, or wood. Barriers are often used to prevent entry to restricted areas or control traffic flow. In this context, the presence of the barrier indicates that the ego car must come to a stop or find an alternate route since the pathway ahead is not accessible.",

This barrier is intended for traffic control and serves as a physical obstruction to prevent vehicles from proceeding along the path where it has been set up. The presence of the barrier necessitates that the ego car must stop and may require either a change in direction, if possible, or waiting until the barrier is removed or opened to continue driving on that route.",
