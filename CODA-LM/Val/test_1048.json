        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles and a barrier that are noteworthy. On the right side, there is a large orange vehicle that is currently maintaining its lane. There is no immediate danger from this vehicle, but it is important to stay alert in case it decides to change lanes. On the left side, a bus is partially obscured by a frame, suggesting that it is approaching and may execute a lateral movement soon. This could mean the bus is either changing lanes or preparing to stop at a bus station, which would require nearby vehicles to either slow down or change lanes to maintain smooth traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier on the left side of the road, characterized by a yellow guardrail and conical signs, signaling a road construction zone. This situation implies that there could be hazards ahead or possible lane closures. As a result, vehicles should proceed with caution and be prepared to merge to the right if the current lane becomes blocked. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of a stationary large vehicle on the right, our vehicle should prepare to slow down and consider changing lanes when safe, while monitoring the bus for any speed or directional changes. Additionally, our vehicle should remain alert to the construction area indicated by obstacles and cones, ready to respond to potential road condition changes or unexpected obstacles due to road construction. Maintain a safe following distance from the bus on the left, paying attention to any signs of lateral movement, and prepare to slow down when it stops to pick up or drop off passengers. Stay vigilant for possible actions from the orange truck on the right, as this may affect visibility. Additionally, be prepared to merge lanes or adjust lane positioning in response to traffic cones signaling a construction area or lane closure. Drive cautiously and be ready to safely navigate changing traffic conditions.",
