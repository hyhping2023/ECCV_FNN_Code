Firstly, there is a variety of vehicles ahead, including a white van on the left lane and other cars on the road. These vehicles are actively participating in the traffic flow and their actions, such as potential sudden stops or lane changes, are critical for the autonomous vehicle to monitor and respond to accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle. The proximity of the cyclist to the road necessitates that the vehicle maintains a safe passing distance to ensure the cyclist's safety.\n\nAt the intersection, the traffic light for this lane is green, granting the right of way to the autonomous vehicle. Despite this, it is essential for the vehicle to remain vigilant of other road users and any unexpected vehicle movements, proceeding with caution even when the light is green.\n\nLastly, there is a motorcyclist riding in the wrong direction on the left side of the road. However, since they are not in the same lane as the autonomous vehicle, their presence does not impact the driving decisions of the vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance behind the slowly moving overloaded vehicle ahead, in order to respond to any potential obstacles or unstable maneuvers. Also, pay attention to whether there are signs indicating that the white van at the intersection may cross the lanes, and give ample space when overtaking bicycles. At the same time, continue to monitor whether vehicles in the oncoming lane may suddenly turn or stop. Even though the traffic light is green, you should still drive cautiously in a complex driving environment, especially due to the presence of overloaded vehicles ahead which necessitates maintaining a cautious speed. Be prepared to brake at any moment or to avoid debris in case objects fall from the vehicle in front. Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles; since the traffic light is green, carefully proceed while paying attention to the behaviors of other users at the intersection. Be aware of motorcyclists and other potential vehicles that may unexpectedly enter your lane. Watch for signs that the cargo on the truck to your right might shift or fall off, which might require you to slow down and maintain a safe following distance. Continue to observe the movements of the vehicles ahead and be ready to react to their actions at any time. Keep checking for motorcycles to ensure they don't suddenly enter your lane. Although the traffic light is green, your vehicle should still continue to move forward but at a speed that allows you to quickly respond to the sudden actions of other road users ahead.",
