The truck's size and potentially slower movement may influence the ego car's lane choice, following distance, and overtaking behavior.\n2.

This vehicle's size and proximity may affect the ego car's ability to maneuver or change lanes.\n3. Several vehicles ahead in the same lane as the ego car, with red tail lights indicating they are either moving slowly or stopped. These vehicles will dictate the speed and following distance of the ego car.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene are not directly visible or identifiable, meaning they do not provide actionable information for the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\nConcrete barriers line the median of the road to the left of the ego car. These barriers restrict lane changes to the left and require the ego car to maintain its current path or move right, if necessary."

For autonomous driving decisions, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow movement or sudden stops. The size of the construction vehicle also indicates that it may take up more than one lane, or could potentially make wide turns, thus requiring extra caution when the ego car is navigating around it.",

Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed appropriately and be ready to adjust the following distance to ensure safety. Lane changes to the left might be restricted due to the concrete barriers; hence, any necessary lane changes should be planned well in advance and executed with caution. Keep within the lane, considering the nearby concrete barrier, and continue to monitor the surrounding traffic for any changes in behavior or lane positions."
