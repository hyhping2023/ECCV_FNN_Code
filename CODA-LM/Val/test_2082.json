Firstly, there is a large construction vehicle directly in front of the ego car, taking up the entire lane and partially blocking the adjacent lane to the left. This vehicle's size and position, along with the extended arm, indicate that it could move or engage in activity that would affect the driving conditions, necessitating caution from the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dark-colored SUV in the lane to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead and traveling parallel. The ego car needs to monitor this SUV closely, as any maneuvers to bypass the construction vehicle will require awareness of the SUV's movements.\n\nA passenger car is also present in the right lane, stationary, which could be due to traffic. The ego car must be cautious around this vehicle, particularly if considering a lane change to the right.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there is a blue rectangular traffic sign with white pictograms indicating parking areas or zones. This sign is important for drivers looking for parking and could also signal the presence of parked cars that might affect traffic flow.\n\nThe traffic lights ahead are displaying red for all lanes, which means all vehicles, including the ego car, are required to stop and wait for the lights to change before proceeding.\n\nLastly, blue metal barriers are positioned along the median, separating the directions of traffic. These barriers limit the ego car to its own lanes and eliminate the option of crossing to the opposite side of the road."
