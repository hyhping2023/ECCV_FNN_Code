        "description and explanation": "In the scene portrayed by the traffic image, we observe several road elements that influence driving decisions.\n\nA blue taxi is parked on the right side of the image, identified by its stationary position and an open driver's door, suggesting the possibility of the driver entering or exiting the vehicle. This requires our autonomous vehicle to approach the situation with caution, as there is a risk of the taxi unexpectedly merging into the flow of traffic or the driver stepping out onto the road, requiring a readiness to decelerate or come to a halt if necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, also on the right side, a pedestrian is seen walking in proximity to our vehicle, heading towards the background. Considering how unpredictable pedestrian movements can be, it is essential that the autonomous vehicle monitors this individual's activities attentively, preparing to modify its velocity or trajectory as needed to ensure safety.\n\nLastly, on the left side of the image, there is a collection of large cable reels stationed on open ground beyond the roadside limit. While these objects are immobile and are not currently influencing the driving behavior, they represent a potential hazard in the unlikely event that they somehow encroach onto the road. Hence, while not requiring immediate action, they should still remain within the situational awareness of the autonomous driving system.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this image and thus do not factor into this analysis."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a low speed and keep a safe distance from taxis and pedestrians, being prepared to stop at any moment when pedestrians change direction onto the path of the vehicle or when a taxi suddenly starts moving. The opening of a taxi driver's door is a sign that there might be sudden movements, so extra caution is needed when near the vehicle. Continue to be vigilant of any other potential hazards around you and respond accordingly.",
