Additionally, a vehicle is visible on a perpendicular road to the right, stopped due to a red traffic light, which does not immediately affect the ego vehicle's path but is worth monitoring for any movement when the light changes. A third vehicle is also present in the opposite lane, traveling away; while it doesn't directly affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions, it signals normal traffic flow during nighttime.\n\nDirectly ahead, the ego vehicle faces a red traffic light, necessitating a full stop at the intersection until it turns green. Reflective traffic cones are placed along the median strip to the left, indicating that the ego car must stay right, likely due to construction or a road hazard. Barriers are also observed: yellow barriers are on the right, defining the driveable boundary and influencing the lane's available width, and median-strip barriers separate the opposing traffic lanes, enhancing safety. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects are reported in this traffic image."

The placement of the cone in the picture suggests that there may be roadwork ahead, an obstacle on the road, or that a specific lane is closed.

Additionally, maintaining a safe distance from the barriers and staying within the lane markings is advisable. Monitor the perpendicular vehicle in case the lights change and it enters the intersection."
