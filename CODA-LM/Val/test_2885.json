Self-driving vehicles should also stay within the traffic lanes according to road markings. When passing obstacles, use the vehicle's headlights and hazard warning lights if necessary to increase visibility to others. Due to low visibility, slow down to have a safer reaction time for any sudden hazards.",

Depending on its proximity to the driving lane, the ego car may need to adjust its trajectory to maintain a safe distance from the parked car and ensure there is ample room to pass without risking a collision. The ego car's sensors should continue to monitor the stationary car for any signs of movement that might affect its path.",
