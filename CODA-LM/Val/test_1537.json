Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, which is obstructing the parking lane and partly extending onto the driving lane. This vehicle poses a challenge for the ego car, as it restricts the available lane width, necessitating careful maneuvering to avoid a collision.\n\nFurther down the same right lane, another white sedan is positioned parallel to the parked car, which could indicate congested or slow-moving traffic ahead. The ego car should be prepared for potential stop-and-go traffic or consider a lane change due to the presence of multiple vehicles along the right side.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other vehicles visible further down the road, including a silver SUV and a red van. While these vehicles are not directly affecting the immediate path of the ego car, their presence indicates that there may be traffic or parking activity further ahead, which could influence future driving decisions.\n\nA pedestrian is also present in the scene, positioned between the ego car and the white sedan ahead, slightly off to the right. The pedestrian is facing away from the ego car and appears to be interacting with the parked vehicle. Due to the pedestrian's potential for unpredictable movement and the possibility of entering the driving lane, the ego car should maintain slow speeds and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."

The external wing mirrors and possible camera systems should be used to ensure that no other road users are in the blind spot while passing the parked car. The ego car should be prepared to stop if the pedestrian steps into the roadway. After passing the pedestrian and the parked vehicle safely, the ego car can continue at a normal speed if the road ahead remains clear. Additionally, be prepared to shift to the left lane if necessary, to avoid the pedestrian and the parked vehicles. Monitor the behavior of the parked car's occupant for any signs of movement which could impact traffic flow or safety. Passing should be done with caution, ensuring there is no oncoming traffic in the adjacent lane and that there is a safe distance from the pedestrian and other obstacles."
