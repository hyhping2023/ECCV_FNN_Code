The positions and speeds of these vehicles are critical as they will determine the availability of gaps for potential lane changes or if speed adjustments are necessary for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue rectangular direction sign mounted overhead on the far right side of the road. This sign is important as it provides advance information on lane usage, exits, or special conditions ahead, which may influence the ego vehicle's lane choice and trajectory planning.\n\nA sequence of traffic cones is also present, starting from the mid to the distant part of the image on the right side. These cones separate the ego car's lane from the right lane, which is undergoing work or is closed. The presence of these cones means that the ego car must remain in its current lane and may need to adjust its speed to comply with road work safety requirements.\n\nLastly, continuous metal barriers are installed on both sides of the highway. These barriers serve to delineate the road and restrict vehicle movement to the roadway, clearly indicating that no overtaking or turns are allowed, except at designated areas.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
