A small blue car with a distinctive company logo is parked on the side of the road to the left of the ego car. This stationary car likely does not impact the immediate driving path but should be monitored for any unexpected movement. Additionally, a white sedan farther down the street appears to be in motion and is facing towards the ego car; its movements are crucial to watch for potential oncoming traffic interaction.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, several pedestrians are visible. Of note, one person dressed in red is crossing the road, and a security guard is standing on the sidewalk. The pedestrian crossing poses a potential risk as they might enter the driving path of the ego car. Although the security guard is stationary and not an immediate concern, his presence indicates potential pedestrian activity, requiring vigilance.\n\nNo traffic signs are present in the image, and the absence of visible traffic lights necessitates the ego car to follow standard right-of-way rules, particularly given the pedestrian activity.\n\nYellow traffic cones are positioned in the middle of the road, creating a barrier between lanes. These cones indicate lane restrictions and direct traffic flow, which necessitates adherence to lane changes.\n\nRegarding other objects, a market stall with fruits is positioned on the left with parked bicycles next to the blue car. These stationary objects are not directly in the ego car's path but suggest heavy pedestrian activity and potential obstructions as pedestrians may move towards or away from the stall. Additionally, there is a date and time stamp on the image, indicating it was taken on March 13, 2021, at 18:21:01, which provides context for the image but has no direct impact on driving behavior."
