        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a few notable elements affecting the driving behavior of the self-driving vehicle. First, there is a white sedan in front of the car on the left side with its brake lights on, which indicates it is either slowing down or stopping. This has caused the self-driving vehicle to decelerate and maintain a safe distance. Additionally, there is a cement mixer truck ahead, occupying the right side of the lane with its rear lights on. The size and position of this truck reduce visibility and maneuverability, necessitating careful monitoring and readiness to stop or slow down. Moreover, a red traffic light is visible at the intersection ahead, which signals that the vehicle must come to a stop at the intersection."
    },
    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should reduce speed while maintaining a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, and prepare to stop at the red light at the intersection, being cautious of the potential reduction in traction due to the wet road surface. It is crucial to monitor the cement mixer truck, as it may obstruct the view and limit maneuvering space. The truck could impede traffic, so our vehicle should only proceed when it is safe to do so. Overtaking should only be considered when the adjacent lane is clearly free of vehicles and it is safe to change lanes.",

Its size and function indicate that it may make wide turns, move slowly, and require more room to operate than average vehicles. The ego car has to maintain a safe following distance, be cautious, and prepared for potential stops or slow movement from this vehicle.",
