        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects. Firstly, there is a green car directly ahead with its brake lights on, suggesting it is slowing down or has stopped. This vehicle's behavior is critical to monitor as it may come to a sudden stop or prepare to turn, affecting the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle. Additionally, further up the road, there are several cars, some with their brake lights on, indicating possible traffic congestion or a general slowdown in traffic flow. The autonomous vehicle should be ready to adjust its speed in response to the upcoming traffic conditions.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a pedestrian who appears to be leaning slightly forward. This posture could imply that the pedestrian might step onto the road. Due to the unpredictability of pedestrian movements, the self-driving car must stay alert and may need to slow down to prevent any potential conflict with the pedestrian entering the lane.\n\nLastly, the scene is well-lit by streetlights along the road, which improves visibility. However, the autonomous vehicle must be cautious of any glare caused by these lights and adjust its sensors and driving strategy to maintain a clear line of sight.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, and thus they do not impact the driving behavior in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "While monitoring whether the vehicle ahead suddenly stops or turns, maintain a cautious speed. Pay attention to pedestrians, especially the one closest to the curb who may be ready to cross the street. As the traffic light is green, you can continue to carefully pass through the intersection, but be prepared for its potential changes. Keep a safe following distance from other vehicles, anticipating possible stops or a slowdown in traffic flow. Considering that the wet road surface may increase braking distance, maintain a safe distance from the car in front. Observe the flow of traffic and be ready to adjust your speed according to the deceleration or stopping of the vehicles ahead. Continue to monitor the traffic lights, making sure to be prepared to stop when they change, and stay alert to any currently invisible changes in road conditions or road users. Maintain a safe following distance from the car in front so that there is sufficient reaction time in case the vehicle ahead suddenly brakes. Be vigilant for pedestrians on the right who may step onto the road, and be ready to slow down or stop. Continue to observe the movements of other vehicles in the lane ahead and opposite, anticipating their actions. Utilize street lighting to maintain good visibility, but be cautious of potential glare.",
