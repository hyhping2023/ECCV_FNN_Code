The vehicles noted include a white sedan in the left lane ahead of the ego car, a blue hatchback directly ahead in the same lane, a red vehicle to the right in the middle lane, and a truck further ahead in the left lane. These vehicles dictate the need for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for potential lane changes, and exercise caution, especially around the truck known for wider turns and blind spots.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene consist of a cyclist on the right shoulder moving in the same direction as the traffic, and a pedestrian on the sidewalk far to the right. Both require monitoring for any unexpected movements into traffic, emphasizing safety and preparedness.\n\nIn terms of road infrastructure and temporary modifications, a yellow and black striped traffic sign indicates a diversion or merge, signaling a change in traffic patterns which the ego car needs to heed. Yellow traffic cones mark a construction zone on the right side of the road, tapering into the lane and necessitating a reduction in speed and potential lane merge by the ego car. Concrete and plastic barriers delineate this construction area from the active traffic lanes, guiding the ego car through narrower lanes and urging caution and awareness of the modified traffic pattern.\n\nThis arrangement of vehicles, road users, and temporary changes collectively influences the ego car's navigation and driving strategy in ensuring safety and compliance with road conditions."
