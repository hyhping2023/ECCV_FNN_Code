It has a reflective orange strip on the rear for visibility and is white in color with red and white reflective stripes.",
                "explanation": "This vehicle significantly influences the decisions of the ego car due to its size and the space it occupies, potentially reducing visibility ahead and requiring a safe following distance. Its size and position directly influence the ego car's ability to move forward or change lanes. It is essential to keep a safe distance due to the heavy-duty nature and potential stopping or turning behaviors of this large vehicle. The presence of the ladder on the back may indicate additional height clearance concerns."

However, the state of the traffic light cannot be determined; thus, it is critical for the ego vehicle to remain alert and proceed according to the visible traffic light state once it becomes clear."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large commercial cement mixer truck directly ahead of the ego vehicle, occupying the full lane. This truck is white in color and features a ladder, mixing drum, and distinct hazard markings, as well as an orange reflective strip for higher visibility and red and white reflective stripes. The ego vehicle must consider this truck's sizable presence, as it reduces visibility and necessitates the maintenance of a safe following distance due to potential slower stopping or unexpected turning movements of the heavy-duty vehicle. Correctly judging distance is crucial, especially considering that the ladder adds to the vehicle's clearance height.\n\nAbove and to the right of this cement mixer, a traffic light is installed, showing a green light, which typically signals that it is safe for the ego vehicle to proceed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to definitively determine the traffic light's state as it is obscured in the image, which means the ego vehicle should remain vigilant and prepared to respond based on the actual visibility of the traffic light's status.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other cars around the ego vehicle, including a blue car to the right of it, suggesting heavy traffic conditions. This will require the ego car to navigate with increased caution, smoothly accelerating or decelerating in response to the traffic's pace and being mindful of the immediate movements of the other vehicles. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."

Given its size and function, the bus may have dedicated lanes and may make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the bus to make such stops, potentially requiring the ego car to slow down or stop accordingly.",

If visibility is reduced due to the size of the cement mixer, be prepared to respond to any changes in traffic conditions that may not be immediately visible. Monitor the traffic light's state and remain alert for any changes to it. Continue to observe the road for any changes in conditions or unexpected obstacles. Prepare for stops or slower traffic as indicated by the heavy traffic scenario. Remain vigilant for the traffic light color change. If necessary, slightly shift within the lane for better visibility of the traffic light while stopping safely behind the truck, ensuring not to enter an intersection on a red light, if applicable."
