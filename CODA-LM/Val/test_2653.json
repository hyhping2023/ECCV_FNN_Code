        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, there are a number of road users and objects. Directly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, there is a large cement mixer truck. Its considerable size occupies most of the lane width, completely obstructing the lane and impacting the driving behavior greatly. Because of this, the ego vehicle would need to slow down or contemplate a lane change if it's possible and safe to do so.\n\nTo the right and slightly behind the ego car, a motorcyclist is navigating through the traffic at the edge of the road. Their presence is critical as the autonomous vehicle may need to factor in their potential movement when considering a lane changeâ€”they could also be attempting to overtake or filter through the traffic.\n\nAlthough not directly on the road, pedestrians are present on the sidewalk to the right, walking parallel to the roadway. The autonomous system must monitor these pedestrians closely in case they unexpectedly step onto the road, which further complicates the driving decision.\n\nAbove the mixer truck, there is a traffic light showing green for forward movement. Typically, this would indicate that it's safe for the ego vehicle to proceed. However, due to the presence of the obstructing cement mixer, the decision to proceed must be taken with caution.\n\nFinally, there is a dustbin also located on the sidewalk to the right, near the pedestrians. While this object doesn't directly affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions, it is still important to consider its presence in anticipation of any unexpected movements that may arise from that area."

Concurrently, the ego vehicle should keep an eye on the motorcyclist to the right and pedestrians to ensure safety for all road users. If the lane next to the ego vehicle is clear and it is safe and legal to do so, the ego vehicle may consider changing lanes to overtake the cement mixer truck. However, if lane changing is not possible, the ego vehicle should wait for the truck to either turn or move sufficiently ahead so that it can follow at a safe distance."
