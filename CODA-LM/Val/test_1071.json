        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario presents a gray SUV ahead in our direction on the right side, slightly obstructing the lane. We should be prepared for the possibility of the SUV unexpectedly changing lanes, which would necessitate our vehicle to decelerate or change lanes to avoid an accident. Behind this SUV, a red car is parked on the right roadside. Even though the car is currently stationary, it's important to stay alert for any unforeseen movement, such as the doors opening without warning. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles traveling in the lanes to our left. These vehicles are proceeding normally, but their ability to navigate into the left lanes could be compromised by the SUV's presence.\n\nAn overhead traffic sign signals an upcoming three-way intersection, providing critical information about the imminent road configuration that must be recognized and acted upon.\n\nMoreover, a traffic light is in operation ahead of our vehicle, showing a red light for left turns and a green light for going straight. This indicates that the vehicle must stop at the intersection to wait for a green signal before making a left turn, whereas it is permitted to continue moving straight ahead.\n\nNo other vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are reported in the current traffic image, suggesting clear conditions in those aspects."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light, this vehicle must stop at the intersection and wait for the signal to turn green before continuing. The green light allows this vehicle to go straight but prohibits left turns. Considering that the grey SUV may block the lane, and the parked red car on the side may enter the traffic flow, this vehicle should also maintain a cautious speed. Unless necessary and with care, one should not attempt to change lanes to the left, as there is traffic in the adjacent lane. While braking for the red light, this vehicle should continuously monitor the rear-approaching traffic in the rearview mirror. Be aware of the bicycle on the right, anticipate its potential movement into the lane, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes safely if necessary. Lastly, maintain a safe distance from the roadside to avoid interference from the green boxes.",
