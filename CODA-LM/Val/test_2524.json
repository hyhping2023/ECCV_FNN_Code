        "description and explanation": "In the present traffic scenario, we have a single traffic sign, a set of traffic cones, and a barrier, while there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present.\n\nA height restriction sign is situated on the right side of the road just before the underpass, indicating a maximum clearance of 2.6 meters. This implies that the ego car, if it is tall or carrying tall cargo, must take heed and avoid proceeding under the overpass if its height exceeds this limit.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones placed diagonally across one side of the road. This arrangement signals that traffic must merge left, directing vehicles to safely transition from a closed lane to an open one due to a narrowed road space ahead.\n\nLastly, there is a continuous white concrete barrier running along the right side of the road, which is topped with barbed wire. This serves to separate the road from the adjacent properties and helps to restrict unexpected entries onto the road, such as pedestrians. The presence of this barrier necessitates that the ego vehicle maintain a prudent distance to avoid any potential hazards."

In this scenario, the presence of the bollard indicates that the road is likely to be divided or there is a restriction for vehicles, influencing the driver of the ego car to remain in the current lane and not attempt to drive over into the restricted area.",
