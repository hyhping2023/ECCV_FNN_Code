        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are no vehicles directly affecting the ego car’s path, but there is a motorcyclist ahead in the same lane. The motorcyclist has visible rear lights and is in motion, which means the ego car needs to maintain a safe distance due to the motorcyclist's vulnerability and potential for sudden speed or directional changes.\n\nOn the approach, the ego car is also facing a green traffic light, allowing it to proceed. However, the driver should remain cautious, particularly because of the motorcyclist in front; thus, while the traffic light grants the right of way, the motorcyclist's presence dictates a more defensive driving approach.\n\nAside from the immediate interaction with the motorcyclist and the traffic light, there is an additional stationary object to consider—a white car parked on the right side, outside of the ego car’s direct lane of travel. Although it does not obstruct the ego car’s lane, the parked car could still be a potential hazard if any road users were to emerge from around it. Therefore, it is important for the ego car’s sensors and systems to monitor the situation for any unexpected movements near the parked car. \n\nThere are no other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers identified in the image that would impact the ego car's current driving decisions."

Continue moving forward as the traffic light is green, but remain alert and cautious. Adjust the headlights if necessary to ensure good visibility while not blinding the motorcyclist or other road users. The ego car should be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential hazard that the motorcyclist might encounter or create. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car should continue moving forward, observing the speed limit and road conditions, while always being ready to stop or take evasive action if the situation changes. Extra caution should be taken due to low visibility conditions at night, and the surroundings of the parked car should be monitored in case of pedestrians emerging or the car pulling out."
