Its presence restricts the usable width of the right lane and may cause sudden stops or swerving of other vehicles. Overhead directional signs are also visible, indicating lanes for straight travel and a turn option, which the ego car must follow for the intended route and lane usage. The traffic lights in the image are not clearly visible, and their state is indeterminate, so the ego car should approach with caution and be prepared to stop if the lights are red. Several traffic cones are positioned around the construction vehicle, indicating a work area, and they signal to drivers to move away from the work area, suggesting a lane change may be necessary. Additionally, there are barriers or constructions marking, possibly indicating road work or lane closure ahead on the right side, which can affect the traffic flow and may require the ego car to change lanes. There are no vulnerable road users or other objects present in the image."

Observing lane directions from the overhead signs is also important for navigation and compliance with traffic rules."
