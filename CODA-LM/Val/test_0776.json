        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a white sedan directly in front of the autonomous car, traveling in the same direction and either stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle is critical as it influences the following distance and any potential maneuvering of the ego car in response to its actions. Additionally, there are multiple cars parked along both sides of the street, with varying colors and sizes. These parked cars limit the available roadway and may conceal hazards such as pedestrians stepping onto the road. Moreover, there is a vehicle on the right side that appears to be in the process of parking, suggested by its position near the parked vehicles and possibly active reverse lights. This parking activity requires the ego vehicle to be ready to alter its speed or trajectory to prevent any incidents. Furthermore, there is a pigeon on the road, roughly positioned in the center of the ego vehicle's lane. This necessitates that the ego car be prepared for the possibility of decelerating to avoid a potential collision with the small animal. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data, suggesting they are either not present or not relevant to the driving behaviors of the ego car in this situation."

            "description and explanation": "This is a domestic animal, commonly known to be a man's best friend, characterized by its four-legged stance and a wagging tail. It appears to be wandering on the road without a visible owner or leash. The presence of the animal on the road could be a potential hazard for drivers, including the ego car. As a precaution, the driver should reduce speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver if necessary to avoid any harm to the animal. It would also be advisable for the driver to alert other road users by using the car's hazard lights or honking discreetly if the animal appears to be moving unpredictably. Ensuring the safety of the animal and preventing any accidents must be a priority in situations like this.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution at a reduced speed to allow time for the pigeon to move and to account for any unexpected actions from it or other road users. Be prepared to make a controlled stop if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, and be mindful of the vehicles parked on both sides of the road that may limit maneuverability. Additionally, adjust the sun visor or use sunglasses to mitigate sun glare and maintain clear visibility. Regularly check mirrors for potential overtaking vehicles and pedestrians that may emerge from behind the parked cars. Since there are no visible road signs or traffic lights to follow, maintain general road rules and speed limits appropriate to this kind of urban street."
