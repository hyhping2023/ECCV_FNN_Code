        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that impact the driving conditions. Firstly, there are parked cars on both sides of the road, consisting of various colors and models, such as sedans and SUVs. These parked cars limit the width of the navigable road space and could conceal moving pedestrians or other road users, increasing the risk of side-swipes if vehicles pass too closely.\n\nAdditionally, there is an SUV on the right side of the road that is slightly protruding onto the driving lane. This vehicle represents an obstacle that requires careful maneuvering to avoid narrowing the driving lane further.\n\nPedestrians are present along the right side of the road, with one individual wearing a blue jacket and another in dark clothing. These pedestrians may step onto the roadway unexpectedly or be hidden by parked vehicles, which means that drivers should maintain lower speeds, be more vigilant, and exercise caution while driving through this area.\n\nWhite and orange traffic barriers are also lined up on the right side, which, in conjunction with the parked cars, narrow the driving lane. These barriers suggest the presence of a construction zone or roadwork, calling for slower speeds and heightened caution.\n\nLastly, there are bags that seem to contain construction materials or trash on the side of the road, including piles of white bags or sacks close to the parked vehicles. These could indicate roadwork ahead or pose as obstacles that might require drivers to take evasive action. They also contribute to reduced road visibility and the usable width of the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

This type of obstruction can influence the driving behavior by requiring the vehicle to slow down, ensure there's enough space and safety to maneuver around it, or come to a complete stop to assess a further course of action.

Keep a vigilant watch for any road users that may emerge between the parked vehicles, and be prepared for sudden stops or maneuvers. Allow for a greater stopping distance due to the wet road surface and be ready to navigate around the protruding SUV with caution. Proceed with caution, maintaining a lower speed to react to possible movements from the pedestrian and to navigate safely past the parked vehicles and barriers. Increase the following distance to account for the reduced traction due to wet road conditions. Be vigilant for any other road users that might be obscured by the parked cars or barriers. If visibility is low or the environment changes, adjust speed accordingly."
