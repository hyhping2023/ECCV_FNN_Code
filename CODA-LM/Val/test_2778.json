It has a rotating drum and visible safety markings, including reflective stripes and hazard warning lights. Due to its size, position, and potential for dropping debris, the ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible lane changes if the truck slows down or stops unexpectedly. Additionally, a bus is visible in the left neighboring lane, partially obstructed by the mixer truck, with commercial advertising on its side and passengers visible through the windows. The presence of the bus requires the ego vehicle to be aware of potential passengers alighting or the bus changing lanes, requiring readiness to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary. A green traffic light is also visible in the distance above, suggesting that the vehicles in front are likely to continue moving forward and the ego car can proceed with caution while the light is green."
