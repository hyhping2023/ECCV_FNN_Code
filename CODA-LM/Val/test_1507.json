A white bus is stopped in the same lane ahead with its brake lights on, necessitating a potential lane change or speed reduction. To the roadside adjacent to the bus, a sanitation vehicle is parked with staff members nearby, posing a temporal obstruction and increasing the likelihood of unexpected pedestrian movement on the road; extra caution is advised.\n\nClose to the sanitation vehicle, workers are spotted near the traffic lane, highlighting a need for vigilance due to the risk they could unexpectedly enter the roadway. On the right, there is a blue circular sign indicating the correct lane for motor vehicles, guiding traffic to follow the arrow's direction and remain in the indicated lane.\n\nThe roadway is narrowed by red and white traffic cones placed to route traffic away from the sidewalk, warranting careful vehicle positioning within the now-restricted lane. Further lane narrowing is caused by red and white striped bollards on the sidewalk, partially intruding into the lane, necessitating a safe distance be maintained from the lane's edge to allow for unimpeded traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, a line of brown garbage bins is positioned behind the traffic cones on the sidewalk next to the parked sanitation vehicle, which could reduce roadway width and obstruct the driver's view, calling for careful navigation and continued attentiveness. Traffic lights are not depicted in this particular image and hence are not a contributing factor to vehicular behavior at this time."

    "driving_suggestion": "When driving a vehicle, you should reduce your speed and maintain a safe distance from the bus stopped ahead, being ready to change to the left lane if the bus remains stationary and the lane on the left is clear. Considering that there are workers by the roadside and the road narrows which is marked by traffic cones and barriers, you should drive with caution. Keep a safe distance from the sanitation truck on your right to prevent any sudden movements or pedestrians emerging. Pay attention to any signals from workers who may enter the road on the right side. Stay alert to changes indicated by the traffic signs ahead.",
