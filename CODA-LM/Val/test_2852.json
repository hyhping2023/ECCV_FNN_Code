The ego car should also keep a safe distance from parked vehicles to avoid potential doors opening or pedestrians emerging suddenly from between vehicles. Due to low visibility and the environment suggesting a residential or congested area, the ego vehicle should proceed with cautious speed and heightened alertness. The headlights should be utilized effectively to ensure the path ahead is adequately lit, and the driver should be prepared for unexpected obstacles or the sudden appearance of pedestrians or animals. Given that the parked vehicles could obscure potential road users emerging from between them, a vigilant pace that allows for quick stops if necessary is suggested. Be prepared to stop or maneuver if any of the parked vehicles show signs of movement, such as lights turning on or wheels turning. Use low-beam headlights to ensure good visibility and to signal presence to any other road users not immediately visible."
