A yellow construction vehicle is stopped ahead, occupying one lane. This reduces the available lanes and may necessitate a lane change.\n2. Multiple cars are on the left side, some moving and some stationary, likely due to traffic congestion. This could impact decisions to change lanes to the left.\n3. A white SUV is in the adjacent lane to the left, traveling in the same direction. It can change lanes or adjust speed, influencing positioning and speed choices.\n4. Several cars are parked on the right side of the road, some encroaching into the traffic lane, limiting available road width and needing careful monitoring.\n\nVulnerable road users include:\n- Several construction workers wearing reflective vests and safety helmets are working next to the yellow construction vehicle on the right. Ensuring their safety may require reducing speed and changing lanes where safe.\n\nA traffic sign:\n- A pedestrian crossing sign is installed to the right of the vehicle, indicating potential pedestrian activity ahead. Cautious driving is advised, especially with nearby road construction.\n\nTraffic cones are also present:\n- Traffic cones are placed on the left, in front of the construction workers and vehicles, likely indicating lane closures or construction areas, suggesting the need to avoid this section and consider lane changes.\n\nOther objects and conditions include:\n- Gloomy and rainy weather, which could make roads slippery. Reduced visibility and traction recommend reducing speed and increasing the following distance between vehicles."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of construction vehicles and workers ahead, as well as the slippery road conditions, the vehicle should slow down and remain highly vigilant. Lane-changing maneuvers should only be performed when it is safe and necessary to navigate around obstacles. Since the right lane seems to be obstructed, it is advisable to merge carefully into the left lane, ensuring that traffic conditions are checked in rear-view mirrors and blind spots. Exercising caution for potential pedestrians in the construction zone and for traffic signs is necessary. Finally, adjust speed to accommodate reduced visibility and traction due to wet weather conditions.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large yellow vehicle commonly seen on construction sites. It seems to be involved in roadwork or maintenance, as denoted by the presence of the traffic cones surrounding it and the workers nearby. Because of its function, it is likely to be stationary or moving slowly, and its presence indicates an active work site that may interrupt or slow down traffic. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include reducing speed and preparing to change lanes if necessary, to ensure safety for the construction workers and accommodate any potential road blockages.",
