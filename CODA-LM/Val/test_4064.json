        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects affecting driving behavior. \n\nFirst, a white bus is parked directly in front of this vehicle, occupying the opposite lane. This stationary bus necessitates that the vehicle either stop or change lanes to avoid a collision. Additionally, a white van is parked on the side of the road with its side facing our car. Although the van is not blocking the lane, it may suddenly open its doors or start moving, so it is advisable to drive carefully. Several other cars are parked or stationary on both sides of the road, suggesting potential traffic congestion or that the area might be residential. These stationary vehicles could obstruct pedestrians or animals, and car doors may open into the traffic lane unexpectedly.\n\nSuspended above the road is a traffic light displaying a red signal, indicating that the vehicle must stop and wait until the light turns green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, crosswalk markings are visible directly on the road surface in front of this vehicle, indicating a designated pedestrian crossing. These markers suggest that pedestrians may be present or about to cross the road, requiring the vehicle to be prepared to give way."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red traffic light and the stationary bus on the path, the vehicle should come to a complete stop. It is the safest practice to wait for the red light to turn green. Moreover, the vehicle should also monitor the parked vehicles on the roadside for any sudden movements and be aware of pedestrians on the crosswalks, preparing to yield when necessary. Given there are parked vehicles by the roadside, please drive carefully; watch out for these vehicles potentially opening doors or moving. Maintain a safe speed, and be ready to stop at any moment if a pedestrian suddenly appears from between the parked vehicles. Since there are no visible signs or signals, follow the general road rules of the area. Continuously scan the surroundings where there is parking as visibility of other road users can quickly change. Considering the current state of the traffic lights, the vehicle should come to a full stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green. Furthermore, the vehicle should maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, adhere to traffic rules, and be prepared to respond to pedestrians or other road users who may not be immediately visible in the image.",
