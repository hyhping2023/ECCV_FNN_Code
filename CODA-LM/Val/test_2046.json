        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals a variety of road users and objects which consist of one vehicle, a vulnerable road user, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, while there are no traffic lights noted in this observation.\n\nA white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego car. This vehicle could present a potential hazard as it may open its doors or move into the roadway unexpectedly, warranting caution from the ego vehicle.\n\nA pedestrian is noticed on the sidewalk to the right, walking in the same direction as the ego car. The pedestrian is not currently on the road, but their actions should be carefully monitored in case they decide to cross the street or step unexpectedly onto the road, posing a possible risk.\n\nThe presence of parking signs on the right side indicates a parking area, which implies that vehicles may be entering or leaving parking spaces. This information is crucial as it signifies parked or moving cars might be encountered in this vicinity.\n\nYellow and black striped traffic cones are positioned on the right side, indicating zones where no parking or restricted access is enforced. These cones aim to guide the traffic away from the curb, effectively narrowing the width of the available driving lane and suggesting that the ego car should keep to the left.\n\nYellow bollards found on the side of the road, adjacent to the sidewalk, are installed to prevent cars from parking on the sidewalk and to demarcate the driving area. This could potentially limit the drivable space available for the ego car, necessitating careful navigation.\n\nLastly, other stationary objects like electric poles and cables are observed on the right side of the road. Although these items do not have a direct impact on the driving behavior of the ego car, they are noted as part of the static environment that should be acknowledged.\n\nIn summary, the scene encompasses a variety of elements that collectively influence the driving strategy and behavior of the ego car, necessitating cautious and attentive driving to navigate safely through the environment."

It should also proceed at a safe speed that allows for quick stopping or maneuvering in case the pedestrian enters the roadway. Additionally, the ego car should observe the white sedan for any signs of movement and be prepared to respond accordingly. Maintain a cautious speed, keeping an eye on the parked car and the pedestrian. Prepare to react if the pedestrian changes course or if a car pulls out from the parking area. Stay in the left lane to avoid the parked car, ensuring adequate space for navigating safely past it. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the parked car and being prepared to react if the pedestrian changes direction or the parked car starts moving. Observe the parking signs and bollards to stay within the driveable area, and watch for any other road users that may affect the path of the ego car."
