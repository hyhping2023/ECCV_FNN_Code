        "description and explanation": "On the right side of the road, there is a small orange tractor moving in the same direction as our vehicle, with a visible driver. The tractor is partially occupying the right lane, which means we must exercise caution and may need to change lanes to pass it safely. In the same vicinity, workers can be seen on the roadside. They are wearing high-visibility clothing and appear to be engaged in some kind of roadwork, with one worker standing close to traffic cones. Due to their presence, it's important to slow down, keep a safe distance, and be alert for any unpredictable movements that could arise from their activities.\n\nAdditionally, there's a blue round traffic sign on the left side of the road that shows a white arrow. This sign indicates either a dedicated lane used for the direction pointed by the arrow or an upcoming side road or exit. It serves to alert drivers about potential traffic slowing down to take the turn, or merging onto the road, and it might also signal detours or point out nearby services.\n\nMoreover, orange traffic cones are set out to lead into the right lane, starting beside the tractor and arranged either in a line or diagonally. This setup suggests that the right lane might be closed or obstructed up ahead, which will require vehicles to merge to the left lane, likely because of the roadside work being conducted. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data. This places greater reliance on the traffic signs, the traffic cones, and the need to be vigilant around the roadwork crew to navigate this stretch of road safely."
