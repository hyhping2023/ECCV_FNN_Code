        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a bus on the opposite side of the intersection, which is stationary at a red light. It is important to monitor the bus as it may start moving once the light changes, potentially altering the dynamics at the intersection. Additionally, there is a dark-colored sedan on the left, which is currently not moving. While it does not immediately affect the driving behavior of the ego car, it should be kept under observation in case it enters the traffic flow.\n\nA pedestrian accompanied by a dog is crossing the road from left to right on the pedestrian crossing. This pair is directly in the path of the ego vehicle, and their safety is paramount. Consequently, the ego vehicle must yield and wait for them to safely complete their crossing.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a red traffic light ahead on the right, which is controlling the intersection that the ego car is approaching. This red light legally mandates that the ego car must come to a complete stop at the intersection. The traffic light for the opposite direction is also red, which may indicate that the ego car's traffic light could be green. However, despite the potential green light, the ego car does not have the right of way because of the pedestrian crossing the street.\n\nLastly, there is a curb or road divider to the left of the pedestrian crossing, marking the boundaries of the road lanes. The ego car needs to be mindful of these boundaries when stopping for the red light and the pedestrian. There are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned that affect the driving behavior of the ego car in this scenario."
