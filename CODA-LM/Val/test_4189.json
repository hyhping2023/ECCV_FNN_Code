Firstly, there is a silver van parked on the right side of the road with its rear door open, extending into the road. This poses a potential obstruction for the ego car, which may need to slow down or change lanes to avoid a collision. Additionally, there is a small, colorful toy vehicle near the curb on the right. Although it is not directly affecting traffic, it requires caution as it could indicate the presence of children nearby. An orange mini-vehicle or trailer is also parked on the right side, facing away from the ego car. While it is stationary and not an immediate threat, it should be monitored in case it starts moving.\n\nA dog is lying on the ground near the center of the road, slightly to the left in front of the ego vehicle. The dog could move unpredictably, which might require the ego car to stop or maneuver around it to avoid an incident.\n\nLastly, there are various items such as barrels, stools, a tire, and a red barrel near the parked vehicles and on the sidewalk to the right. These items could become obstacles if they are moved into the roadway by other road users or by the wind. They are not currently in the driving path but should be monitored.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

If the road width permits safe passage around the open van door, proceed slowly, ensuring not to come too close to the small colorful vehicle parked nearby. Monitor parked vehicles for any sign of movement and be prepared for changes in road surface quality. If the path is not clear, the ego vehicle should stop and wait for the obstacles to be cleared. Maintain awareness of any changes in the environment."
