We need to keep a safe following distance as this vehicle could slow down or stop. In addition, a black sedan is spotted in the far-right lane and is also traveling in the same direction as us. Since the black sedan might change lanes, our self-driving vehicle should be ready to adjust its position if necessary. Several other vehicles are present in the middle lane, including one that's notably close to our autonomous vehicle. These vehicles may change lanes, so their movements need to be monitored to adjust speed accordingly.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones.\n\nRoad markings indicate an upcoming merge or end of the lane to our right, signaling that vehicles may merge into our lane from the right and we should be mindful of this potential movement. There are permanent concrete barriers on the right side, which outline the merging section of the lane and stop us from shifting to the right. A metal guardrail is present on the left side to separate the lanes of opposing traffic, ensuring that we stay within the correct lanes and do not swerve into oncoming traffic. Additionally, concrete barriers are located on the left side as well, indicating a separation from the oncoming traffic lanes and signaling the direction of traffic flow, thus indicating no chance for U-turns or crossing to the opposite side.\n\nAfter the merge area, there is an edifice resembling a toll booth on the right roadside. Although this structure is not on the carriageway, the self-driving vehicle should stay vigilant to any surrounding activities that might affect the flow of traffic."

Monitor vehicles entering from the merge area on the right. Continue to follow lane markings and abide by road rules, maintaining a constant and appropriate speed. Pay attention to vehicles in the middle lane, and avoid overtaking upon seeing traffic signs. Due to the presence of a police booth, stay alert for any possible instructions from the police.",
