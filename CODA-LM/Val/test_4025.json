        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles present. On the left side, a blue vehicle is situated on the opposite lane, facing towards our car. It is crucial to keep an eye on this vehicle's proximity and speed to avoid any potential collisions. Additionally, there is a white vehicle visible in the distance ahead, moving in the opposite direction. Since this vehicle might slow down, stop, or change lanes, our car must stay alert to adjust its speed accordingly and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image, there is a barrier to consider. On the right side, a metal fence is partially enclosing a pile of garbage bags. This fence serves as a marker for the edge of the drivable area, indicating that there is no sidewalk on that side. Our vehicle must navigate within the lane markings and keep a safe distance from these obstacles.\n\nLastly, there is a pile of garbage bags behind the barriers on the right-hand sidewalk. While these bags do not directly impede the drivable area, they could potentially attract animals or cause pedestrians to unexpectedly enter the road. Therefore, the vehicle should be prepared for any sudden movements in the vicinity of these materials."

Keep a safe distance from cyclists when overtaking and remain alert for potential unexpected obstacles near the accumulated trash bags. As there are no immediate signs that necessitate changing lanes or turning, please continue to stay in the current lane. Follow the local traffic sign regulations. Since the lane markings are clear, continue to utilize lane-keeping techniques.",

This cone informs the driver of the ego car that there might be road work ahead, obstructions, or a change in traffic patterns. The driver should stay alert, reduce speed if necessary, and prepare to change lanes or navigate around the cone, all while maintaining traffic safety.",
