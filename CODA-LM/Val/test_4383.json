Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in the distance ahead in various lanes, also moving in the same direction. The behavior of these vehicles could affect traffic flow, requiring the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes accordingly.\n\nDirectional signs are visible on the overpass in the distance. These signs might contain important information about lane changes or exits which the ego car needs to prepare for in advance.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are present on the right side of the right lane, indicating a closed-off or hazardous area. The ego car should not enter the space adjacent to them. Alongside the traffic cones, there is a solid barrier on the right, representing the physical limit of the drivable area on that side. The ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions.\n\nLastly, there are green waste bins fallen on the right edge of the lane in which the ego car is traveling. There is a possibility of an obstacle if the bins get pushed into the ego car's lane, so it is important to watch for potential hazards."

Continue to monitor the road conditions and adjust speed as necessary to the flow of surrounding traffic. Additionally, be cautious of the barriers and potential obstacles on the right. If necessary, prepare to slow down or change lanes to the left if the lane ahead becomes obstructed and it's safe to do so, monitoring surrounding traffic and signaling intentions in advance."
