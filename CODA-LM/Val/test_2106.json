The presence of this stationary forklift requires continuous monitoring due to the potential hazard it may present should it start moving unexpectedly. However, as of now, it does not obstruct the passage way.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian wearing a high-visibility vest standing on the left side of the intersection slightly ahead of our vehicle. This pedestrian seems to be directing traffic or performing some job-related duties. Due to the potential for unpredictable pedestrian movement, the vehicle should be prepared to stop or yield if necessary to ensure safety.\n\nIn the image, there is also a traffic light visible in the upper center, with the light for our direction showing red. This signals that the vehicle must come to a complete stop and only proceed when the light turns green.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier on the right side of the image. It appears to be a temporary fence or barrier delineating a construction site or work area. This obstruction may involve road construction or barriers that could require the vehicle to change lanes or exercise caution when passing by the area.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects identified in the image that impact the driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light, this vehicle should come to a complete stop and monitor the stationary forklifts and pedestrians for any signs of movement. Considering the work area on the right, one should proceed with caution. Once the green light comes on, continue to drive carefully, paying close attention to pedestrians and any signals or indications they may give, while also watching for the approach of forklifts and obstacles to prevent collisions.",

The presence of this vehicle should alert the ego car driver to exercise caution, anticipate possible roadwork or obstacles, and be prepared for the presence of construction workers or additional construction equipment.
