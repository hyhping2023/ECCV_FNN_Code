        "description and explanation": "In the image, there are several noteworthy road users and traffic indicators:\n\nFirstly, there is a large white cement mixer truck parked ahead, partially occupying both the right-turn lane and part of the straight-ahead lane. Due to its size and location, it may obstruct the visibility and maneuverability, especially when the vehicle intends to turn right or proceed straight ahead. Additionally, on the right ahead, a white car is seen perpendicular to the direction of travel, indicating potential crossing paths, which might require yielding or affect the right of way.\n\nAbove the road, signposts are installed indicating lanes designated for left turns or straight-ahead travel. These signs inform the vehicle of the available maneuvers and lane usage at the upcoming intersection. Also visible above the intersection are multiple directional and lane indicator signs, assisting with lane selection and navigating intersections according to predetermined routes.\n\nThe traffic light displays a green arrow signal for turning left, while the straight lane has a red light, instructing vehicles going straight to stop and allowing those turning left to proceed.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a pedestrian barrier that separates the sidewalk from the roadway. This barrier helps to prevent pedestrians from accidentally entering the roadway, thus delineating the boundaries of pedestrian zones."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should prepare to slow down and may have to stop behind the cement mixer, ensuring enough safety space and the possibility that the mixer might reverse or turn. Faced with contradictory traffic light information, drivers must assess the actual lights and act accordingly: if the straight-ahead light is red, stop at the intersection to wait; if the left-turn green arrow is lit, proceed carefully in that direction. Pay attention to the movement of the white car at the intersection; your vehicle must be ready to yield if necessary. Be extra cautious with the cement mixer blocking the lane. Whatever action is taken, maintain vigilance to prevent unforeseen movements and follow the correct traffic signal indications.",
