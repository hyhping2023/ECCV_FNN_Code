                "description": "A large yellow construction vehicle, with a front loader, is directly in front of the ego car occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The vehicle appears to be a bulldozer or a similar heavy machinery used in construction, identified by its large wheels and raised front bucket. It is occupying most of the lane width and appears to be moving slowly or stopped based on the posture of the operator inside the cabin.",
                "explanation": "Its presence requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and to be prepared for potential slow movements or sudden stops. Moreover, the ego car should be cautious that the construction vehicle might make wide turns or movements due to its size and function. This vehicle poses an immediate obstruction and could require the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance and continue progressing."

                "explanation": "The parked vehicles reduce the usable width of the lane and require the ego car to be vigilant for any doors opening or pedestrians moving between the vehicles. The presence of parked cars limits the available space for the ego car to maneuver around the construction vehicle ahead."

Without visibility of the traffic light, it should be assumed as non-operational or not present at this section of the road."

                "explanation": "These cones suggest a reduction in the usable road width and inform the ego car to keep clear of this area, impacting the decision on whether to overtake the construction vehicle ahead. This object might indicate that there are road works or a section of the road is closed ahead, suggesting that the ego vehicle may need to prepare to change lanes if necessary."

        "description and explanation": "The traffic image depicts a scene with several elements impacting the driving behavior of the ego car. Directly in front, a large yellow construction vehicle, likely a bulldozer with a front loader, is occupying most of the lane and moving slowly or is stopped. This vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, be cautious of potential slow movements or wide turns, and possibly change lanes to navigate safely around it.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are multiple parked cars in a line, in varying colors. These parked cars reduce the lane's usable width and necessitate vigilance from the ego car for any sudden door openings or pedestrians. This constraint complicates maneuvering around the construction vehicle ahead.\n\nThere are no visible traffic lights influencing the ego car's immediate path. Therefore, the vehicle should adhere to standard road rules and be responsive to other traffic control devices or road markings that might be present but are not visible in the image.\n\nYellow traffic cones are present on the right side of the road, marking an area beside the parked cars, possibly indicating a no-driving zone or construction area. This urges the ego car to steer clear of this region and impacts decisions regarding overtaking the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow barrier is situated on the right side of the road next to the parked cars. This barrier prevents the ego car from using this space for maneuvering, indicating reduced lane width or a construction zone ahead. Consequently, the ego car needs to prepare for potential lane changes or other adjustments to maintain safe driving conditions."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle, likely a bulldozer or a similar heavy machine, based on the elevated driving position, the robust construction, and the large wheels. The presence of such a vehicle on the road indicates that there may be construction work nearby, which could lead to reduced traffic lanes, detours, or slow-moving traffic. The ego car driver should exercise caution, be prepared to slow down, and follow any posted signs or directions from traffic control personnel. Additionally, the size of the vehicle may obstruct visibility, so the driver should be aware of potential blind spots and movements from the construction vehicle.",

The driver should also monitor the parked cars for any emerging pedestrians or opening doors and be prepared for a potential lane merge if the lane narrows further ahead due to the parked cars and barrier on the right side. If overtaking the construction vehicle is necessary and safe to do so, it should be done with caution, ensuring that the opposing lane is clear, and that it complies with road rules and signage. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes to the left to safely pass the construction vehicle if the adjacent lane is clear. It should also remain vigilant for any sudden movements from the construction vehicle, indications of road works, or changes in traffic light status further down the road. If lane changing is not feasible due to traffic, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance until it is safe to pass."
