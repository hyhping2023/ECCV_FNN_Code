        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, two categories of road users are present: vehicles and vulnerable road users. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there are a couple of noteworthy points. Firstly, a truck with a flatbed trailer is situated on the side of the road to the left, conspicuously parked and encroaching slightly on the left lane. It's noteworthy that the flatbed trailer is unladen, carrying no cargo. The significance of this truck's position is twofold; it could potentially obstruct the view of the lane to the left for passing drivers. Additionally, there's a hazard associated with the possibility of the truck unexpectedly moving into the lane. \n\nSecondly, the scene includes multiple large cargo trucks. These vehicles are parked on both sides of the road, taking up space on the roadside and, in some instances, extending into the lanes themselves. The primary concern here is the reduction in the road's usable width, which, in turn, can obstruct the view of other road users. This setup creates hidden spots from which pedestrians might emerge, posing a considerable risk to both the pedestrians and drivers.\n\nNo other categories including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene. This summary encapsulates all the visible elements and their potential implications for road safety and navigation."
