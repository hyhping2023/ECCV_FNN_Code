The presence of this vehicle necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to respond to the sedan's potential sudden stops or turns. Additionally, overhead there is a traffic sign, which seems to be a blue direction or information sign, likely indicating an upcoming exit or point of interest. While the specific information on the sign is not clear, recognizing such signs is essential for navigation and predicting the lane changes of other road users who may be preparing to exit. On the roadway, red and white traffic cones are lined up, marking the boundary of the left lane, signaling that there is roadwork or lane closures ahead and that vehicles should remain within the confines of the open lanes. Furthermore, there are road barriers on the left side, indicating road construction or closure, which means vehicles should keep to the right and avoid entering the closed-off area. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "If within the legal speed limit, maintain the speed of the traffic flow, keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and stay in the rightmost open lane when passing traffic cones and barriers on the left. In addition, self-driving vehicles should continue to monitor the traffic cones on the left side of the lane to ensure a safe lateral distance, and may need to reduce speed to ensure safety if necessary due to narrow lane space. Self-driving vehicles should also be prepared to read and follow the instructions of overhead traffic signs, and be aware of the potential overhead signs indicating the need to change lanes in preparation for an exit.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is typically a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is commonly used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed for utility work or incidents. In the context of driving behavior, the presence of a traffic cone indicates that the driver should proceed with caution and potentially prepare to change lanes or adjust speed to safely navigate through the area where the cones are present.",
