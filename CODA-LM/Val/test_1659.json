        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, a group of vulnerable road users and some objects of interest have been identified. Specifically, there are several pedestrians standing next to large industrial cable spools on the side of the road. These individuals are paying attention to their activities and are not observing the road, which could potentially lead to hazardous situations. The reason why this scenario poses a risk is that pedestrians located close to the road's edge might accidentally step onto the road, thus creating a possible danger to both themselves and the drivers.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of large industrial cable spools near the edge of the road, where the pedestrians are positioned, is also notable. These spools represent a potential threat as they could roll or fall onto the road, causing unexpected obstacles for drivers. The combination of these two factors necessitates cautious driving and heightened awareness in this area to prevent accidents."
