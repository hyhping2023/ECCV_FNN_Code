The truck is positioned on the left side of the image and is partially outside of the frame. It is traveling on the same road as the ego car but in the opposite direction. Due to its presence and direction, it is crucial for the ego car to monitor the movement of the truck closely. This ensures that both the truck and the ego car have adequate space to pass each other safely, avoiding any potential accidents. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Monitor the road ahead for any potential hazards that may come into view, and adjust speed accordingly if the road conditions change. Maintain a safe distance from the semi-trailer truck and adjust speed according to the road conditions to account for potentially longer braking distances. The ego car should stay vigilant for any sudden movements from the semi-trailer truck and be prepared to react accordingly. Monitor for any other traffic participants or signs as visibility is limited."
