If visibility and road conditions allow, the ego vehicle may pass the obstructing vehicle with caution, but it must be prepared for unexpected movements from the accident vehicles or other obstructions not visible in the image. It's also advisable to look for direction or signals from any potential emergency responders or persons involved in the accident."
