A large red truck is found on the right side of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction with a large round object tied to the bed. The truck’s size and load could potentially influence driving behavior due to its large blind spots and the risk of debris falling off. The ego car may need to maintain a safe following distance or overtaking when safe is necessary.\n2. A small blue vehicle is located in the far left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car needs to note this vehicle's presence for lane change considerations and maintaining a safe following distance. Monitoring the vehicle’s turn signals and adjusting speed or lane position accordingly is crucial to avoid collisions.\n3. A blue-green truck is partially visible on the right, appearing to be in motion and possibly merging or maintaining its lane position. The truck’s movements could influence the ego car’s ability to merge or change lanes, requiring vigilance and potential adjustments in speed or position.\n4. A small blue car is in the opposite lane, traveling in the opposite direction. While it has little direct influence on the ego car, it suggests oncoming traffic and the need for caution with maneuvers across the median.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. A large red billboard above the road to the left, which is an advertisement rather than a traffic sign. Although it does not provide traffic instructions, it could be a distraction due to its size and prominent placement. The ego car needs to be aware of potential distracted drivers due to the billboard."

This type of vehicle can influence driving behavior by potentially moving slower than other traffic, making wide turns, or stopping unexpectedly. Drivers must exercise caution, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speeds when driving near construction vehicles.",

Keep aware of the blue vehicle's position before considering any lane changes. Stay attentive to the surrounding traffic and any potential signs or signals that come into view further along the road. Continue driving at a speed appropriate for the road conditions and traffic density. Maintain a safe following distance from the red truck, staying in the current lane while monitoring the blue-green truck's movement for potential lane merging activity. Do not attempt to overtake unless the lane to the left is clear of oncoming traffic and it is safe to do so. Avoid distractions from billboards and maintain focus on the road and surrounding vehicles. Maintain a safe following distance from the red heavy truck and monitor it for any changes in speed or lane position. Also, stay alert for the small blue car that may cross the ego car's path if it decides to turn. Adjust speed and positioning as necessary to allow for the blue car to make its turn safely. In scenarios like this, where larger vehicles may obstruct view and smaller vehicles may be positioned to make turns, it is important for the ego car to drive defensively and be prepared for sudden changes in the flow of traffic."
