        "description and explanation": "The current traffic scenario presents a few key challenges for the autonomous vehicle. Ahead, there is a white sedan slightly to its right with its brake lights illuminated, suggesting that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. It’s crucial for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to decelerate or halt as needed.\n\nOncoming traffic poses another concern, with several vehicles approaching from the opposite lane. The sunlight is causing glare, making it harder to see these vehicles clearly. It is essential for our vehicle to stay within its lane and to be especially alert for any unexpected occurrences like sudden movements from the oncoming cars or issues stemming from the glare affecting visibility.\n\nMoreover, there's a cyclist to the left, in the opposing lane, who is heading towards our direction. The vehicle should keep a watchful eye on the cyclist and ensure there's enough room to safely pass, ready to respond to any unanticipated changes in path the cyclist might take.\n\nLastly, the problem of reduced visibility due to the low sunlight and glare could interfere with sensor performance. Therefore, the vehicle’s sensors may require adjustments to preserve their capability to accurately identify road users and avoid obstacles despite these suboptimal visual conditions.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers were detected in the scene, and hence they do not require consideration in this driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and be prepared to slow down or stop due to queued traffic and the braking behavior of the white sedan. Pay attention to the red vehicle and the red multipurpose vehicle parked on the right to see if they suddenly merge into the traffic flow or if pedestrians suddenly appear. Stay alert to vehicles in adjacent lanes and be ready to respond to them entering your lane at any time. Drive carefully when overtaking cyclists, providing ample safe space. Adjust sensors and systems to reduce the impact of glare, and stay vigilant for oncoming traffic. In the absence of traffic control lights or signs, drive cautiously and adhere to standard road rules. Continuously observe the road and surrounding environment to be aware of any additional hazards or changes in traffic conditions.",
