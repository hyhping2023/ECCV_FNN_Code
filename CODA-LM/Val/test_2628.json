        "description and explanation": "In the observation, we note multiple vehicles parked on both sides of the road; they are of varying colors, including black and silver, and are oriented in different directions. Due to the parked cars, the drivable path along the road has been narrowed, creating a need for cautious driving. The possibility of doors opening or pedestrians emerging from between the parked vehicles requires the ego vehicle to moderate its speed for safety.\n\nFurther into the scene, we detect a pedestrian clad in a blue top and dark pants, who is engaged in pushing a cart in the center roadway and is moving away from the ego car. The presence and movements of this pedestrian mandate the ego vehicle to ease off the throttle and be ready to brake if necessary to prevent any harm.\n\nAdditionally, a 'No Parking' sign, conspicuous with its red and white colors, is located on the right-hand side of the road, marking the entrance to a parking zone. This sign serves as an alert to the driving system to be on the lookout for road users that may be in proximity to this area.\n\nMoreover, a sequence of orange traffic cones has been placed alongside the right edge of the road, stretching towards the ego car's trajectory. These cones imply the likelihood of a road hazard or ongoing construction work ahead, signifying the need for the autonomous vehicle to decelerate and heighten its vigilance to navigate safely through this segment.\n\nIn this particular frame, there are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that have a significant impact on driving conditions."
