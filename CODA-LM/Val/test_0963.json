        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles of interest. The first is a white sedan located on the left side of the ego vehicle. It is in a left-turn lane, oriented parallel to the ego vehicle, and is signaling its intention to turn left. The presence of this vehicle is significant because it may begin to turn left soon, which could influence the driving decisions of the ego car, especially if the ego car is planning to make a maneuver in that direction.\n\nThe second vehicle is a large truck positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. The truck is in the same lane and traveling in the same direction as the ego car. It has a visible load, which is important because it limits the forward visibility for the ego vehicle's sensors and driver. Consequently, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance to react appropriately to any potential changes in the truck's speed or direction.\n\nAdditionally, there are three traffic lights at the intersection ahead. The traffic light facing the ego vehicle is green, which allows the ego vehicle to proceed through the intersection, provided that the way is clear and it is safe to do so.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the ego vehicle's driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, preparing to slow down if the truck's behavior suggests it will make a turn or stop. The presence of a vehicle in the left-turn lane suggests that the ego car should be aware of potential left-turning traffic crossing its path. Since the traffic light is green and assuming there are no other road users or signals the ego car has not picked up, it should proceed with caution through the intersection, while continually monitoring for any changes in the traffic signal or unexpected maneuvers by other road users."
