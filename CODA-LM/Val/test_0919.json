    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should monitor the movements of large trucks and be prepared to slow down or stop. It should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead and be ready to respond to potential congestion or vehicles merging into the lane. Pay attention to the dynamics of motorcycles on the right side to prevent them from joining the traffic flow. Due to the lack of obvious traffic control, the vehicle should follow general road rules and drive cautiously when passing obstacles and busy areas. The vehicle should also remain alert to roadworks possibly caused by the presence of excavators. Overtaking may be necessary, but it should be done cautiously due to limited visibility and possible oncoming traffic. Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, especially trucks on the left that block the view. Be prepared to handle slow-moving traffic. Watch for motorcycles and construction machinery on the right side, ensuring cautious passage. Regularly check mirrors and blind spots to prevent any unexpected movements. It is recommended to drive in the right lane and be prepared to slow down or stop depending on the traffic conditions ahead.",
