        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles and one other object of interest that affect the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there is a white van parked on the left side of the road, with its rear lights illuminated and facing away from the ego vehicle's perspective. The parked van suggests there might be activity around it, such as people getting in or out, which could affect the ego car's path. Although the van is stationary and does not pose an immediate danger, the ego vehicle should remain cautious of potential movement or doors opening.\n\nSecondly, the headlights of an oncoming vehicle are visible, facing the ego car. This oncoming vehicle is directly in the path of the ego car and will need to be navigated around safely. This may require a lane change or speed adjustment by the ego vehicle. The bright headlights of the oncoming vehicle could be misleading as they make it difficult to ascertain its exact position and movement, which is crucial for the ego vehicle to adjust its path or speed appropriately.\n\nThirdly, a dark-colored sedan is parked on the right side of the road, also facing away from the ego vehicle. While the sedan is stationary, its presence requires the ego vehicle to be vigilant for unexpected movements or pedestrians that may emerge from behind it.\n\nLastly, there is glare from vehicle lights reflecting on the wet road, which is obstructing vision. This glare can temporarily blind the ego vehicle's sensors or the driver, making it harder to discern other road users and obstacles. The glare significantly impairs visual perception of the road environment, necessitating slower speeds and heightened caution.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers."

The brightness of the headlights suggests that the vehicle is facing towards the ego vehicle, and this could be a situation where both vehicles are on a collision course if in the same lane or preparing to pass each other if on a two-way road.

Use low-beam headlights to reduce glare for oncoming traffic and improve visibility. Proceed with caution due to low visibility at night, maintain a lower speed to respond to potential hazards, and be prepared to stop for unexpected obstructions or movements from the parked vehicles or pedestrians that may not be visible now but could emerge from blind spots or between vehicles. The ego vehicle should proceed with caution due to limited visibility caused by glare from the oncoming vehicle's headlights. Reducing speed and being prepared to stop if the oncoming vehicle enters the same lane is suggested. If the oncoming vehicle's intentions can't be determined, the ego vehicle should come to a safe stop and wait for clarity to prevent a potential collision."
