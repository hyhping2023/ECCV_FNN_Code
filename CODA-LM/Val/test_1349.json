While this sign aids in lane choice and route planning, it does not immediately affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nThe traffic light in the distance appears to be green, allowing traffic to move forward. This means the ego car can proceed but must remain cautious and aware of the traffic ahead that may not have fully responded to the green light yet.\n\nBright orange traffic cones with reflective striping are forming a line, guiding vehicles away from the right side of the road. This suggests there may be roadwork or a hazard on the right side and vehicles are required to merge left if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary yellow and red striped barriers on the right side of the road, further emphasizing the restricted area beyond the traffic cones. This indicates a zone where vehicles are not permitted, stressing the need for the ego car to keep left.\n\nNo vulnerable road users or other objects were observed in the current traffic image."
