As it is positioned on the side and not on the active roadway, the immediate influence on the driving behavior of the ego car may not be significant. However, the presence of such a vehicle suggests there could be construction workers nearby, potential obstacles, or changes in traffic patterns ahead. The driver of the ego car should remain alert for any signage indicating construction zones and should be prepared to reduce speed or follow detour instructions if necessary.",

Keep a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead-more than usual due to potentially slick road conditions-and reduce speed appropriately in response to the road surface being wet. Keep vigilant of changes in traffic flow and be ready to react to other vehicles' brake lights or sudden movements."
