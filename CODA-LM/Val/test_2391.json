Due to the pedestrian's distracted state and the unpredictability of the dog's movements, it's important for the ego car to stay vigilant and be ready to take action if they were to step into the road.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes multiple traffic signs indicating a pedestrian zone on the right side of the road. The ego car should take note of these signs as a warning of potential pedestrian activity and possible reduced speed limits ahead in order to ensure safe driving practices. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that require the ego car's attention."
