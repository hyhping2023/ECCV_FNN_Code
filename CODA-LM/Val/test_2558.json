Since pedestrians can behave unpredictably and may step into the driving lane, it is crucial to stay alert and be prepared to stop at any time. Additionally, there are utility poles and wires on the side of the street, which are static objects and do not directly impact driving behavior. However, it is important to be cautious of stationary objects, ensuring they are not obstructing the road, which would necessitate altering driving behavior."
