While the vehicle is stationary and does not present an immediate dynamic threat to the ego vehicle, it is important to be aware of it, especially if the ego vehicle plans to navigate close to the parked van.\n\nAdditionally, there are large industrial cable spools located on the right side of the road. These spools vary in size and are positioned upright. They are not directly on the road, but given their close proximity, there is a potential risk if they were to roll or fall into the path of the ego vehicle. Therefore, the ego car should keep a safe distance from the side of the road where these spools are present to avoid any hazards."
