        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, various road users and objects play a role in influencing the behavior of the ego car. \n\nThere is a white car moving across the intersection from left to right, in front of the ego car. It has priority because the traffic light for its path is currently green. Consequentially, the white car's movement affects the ego car's potential route because it must yield to this car crossing its path.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow utility truck stationed on the right side, beyond the intersection. A worker appears to be using lifting equipment on a raised platform, which suggests ongoing work zone or maintenance activity. This truck's presence is significant as it may lead to unexpected movements or obstructions on the road.\n\nThe scene also includes pedestrians crossing the street from the right to the left, with one individual showing signs of motion blur, implying a brisk walking speed. The pedestrians are granted the right of way, necessitating that the ego car waits for them to complete their crossing before it can proceed.\n\nMoreover, a cyclist is seen on the far-left corner of the intersection, traversing through the crosswalk. The proximity and potential vulnerability of the cyclist need to be considered in the ego car's decision-making process to ensure safety.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene are displaying red for the direction in which the ego car is facing, with a green light for the cross traffic. Therefore, the ego car is obliged to stop at the light until it changes to green.\n\nAnother notable factor is the presence of traffic barriers placed along the right-hand edge of the intersection, which are partly obscured by the utility truck. These barriers potentially signal an upcoming road work zone or a lane closure, demanding careful attention from the ego car as it progresses.\n\nLastly, there are traffic bollards set up along the right side of the road designating the travel path. These bollards serve as a guide for the ego car, indicating regions that are not to be entered by vehicles and ensuring that the car stays within the correct lane boundaries. \n\nThe traffic signs and traffic cones categories are not present in this image and therefore do not have any impact on the ego car's driving behavior in the current scenario."
