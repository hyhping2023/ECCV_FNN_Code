A black car is parked on the left side, opposite the direction of our vehicle, possibly posing a risk of causing an obstruction if it unexpectedly opens its door or pulls out. On the same side, a red car moves away from our vehicle, serving as a live reference for the traffic flow and lane usage, although it partially blocks the potential route ahead, emphasizing the need for maintaining a safe following distance. Further ahead on the right side, a white car is parked perpendicular to our direction of travel, which might influence our driving path should the vehicle decide to proceed straight ahead. Also parked on the right is a silver hatchback, facing away, which could present similar hazards as the black car, such as opening doors or the movement of pedestrians.\n\nAdditionally, the right side of the road ahead features a green belt with shrubs, serving as a barrier. It dictates the flow of traffic, compelling the vehicle to adhere to the correct route to navigate safely and follow traffic laws.\n\nThe scene is devoid of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or any other objects that might otherwise affect driving behavior."

Maintain a safe distance from the red car ahead, ready to respond to potential emergency braking. Continue to monitor all surrounding road conditions and users to prevent unforeseen behaviors. Additionally, be aware that oncoming traffic may also be navigating around stationary vehicles. Since the red car ahead is about to turn, proceed with caution and be prepared to stop or yield if necessary.",
