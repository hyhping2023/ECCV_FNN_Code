This device displays colored lights (commonly red, amber/yellow, and green) to regulate traffic, instructing vehicles when to stop, prepare to proceed, or move through the intersection. The current status of the signal directly affects the driving behavior of the vehicle. For instance, if the signal is red, the vehicle is required to stop. If it is green, the vehicle may proceed if the intersection is clear. If the signal is yellow, the vehicle should prepare to stop, unless it is unsafe to do so because of proximity to the intersection.",
