Also observable are two cyclists in the distance, located at the center of the image, riding side by side on the right road side, going in the opposite direction to the autonomous vehicles, prompting the need for motorists to maintain a safe distance, be ready to slow down or stop if necessary, overtake with caution, and ensure sufficient space for safety. On the left, a barrier is present formed by buildings or construction site fences, separating the road from an adjacent construction area, marking the road's boundaries and suggesting possible driving path restrictions or nearby construction activities. Traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects are not mentioned in the data, indicating their absence in the image."

Be mindful of bicycles and motorcycles ahead; once it is safe to do so, please provide ample space to overtake them.

It appears to be stationary or moving very slowly. Based on the vehicle's presence and considering it is a common sight in areas undergoing construction or where heavy materials are being handled, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance. The driver should be prepared for potential unexpected movements by the construction vehicle or the presence of construction workers and materials around it.",
