This situation requires the self-driving car to alter its course to avoid a collision. Additionally, reflective traffic cones are arranged diagonally across a lane, indicating that the road is narrowing to a single lane. This setup directs traffic to merge when necessary and to proceed with caution. Furthermore, there is an obstacle with reflective elements on the right side of the road, suggesting that there is roadwork or an area closure, and vehicles should remain in their lane and be vigilant for potential hazards. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

Be cautious when merging lanes at night, as visibility may be reduced, and pay attention to any possible additional obstacles or road users that may not be easily visible. Maintain alertness to your surroundings, and look out for any road signs or additional information that may assist in safely passing through the area.",

In this scenario, it is used to indicate some form of road work, obstruction, or to demarcate a specific lane that the ego car should not enter. The presence of this cone will require the driver of the ego car to be alert and possibly shift lanes if the cone is blocking the current lane of travel, or to slow down to pass safely.",
