This vehicle's position necessitates a potential lane change or a halt by the ego car.\n   - Several cars are parked on both sides of the street, creating a narrow passage. This congestion restricts maneuverability, especially when attempting to navigate past the stopped van.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Bicycles parked on the sidewalk to the right without any cyclists or pedestrians interacting with the traffic. Although no immediate action is required, monitoring is advised to anticipate any changes if someone enters the road.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Directional traffic signs are placed overhead across the road. These signs guide upcoming routes and lane usages, potentially affecting routing decisions.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - A public bike-sharing station located on the sidewalk to the right does not impact driving behavior but should be observed for any sudden activities by individuals.\n   - An electrical control box near the parked bicycles on the sidewalk. This object does not directly influence the driving decisions of the ego vehicle but is noted for spatial awareness.\n\nNo traffic cones, barriers, or relevant traffic lights are present in this image."

The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to either slow down or stop and wait for the opportunity to change lanes in order to bypass the van if it continues to remain stationary.

Drive cautiously to be prepared for any other vehicles or pedestrians that might unexpectedly enter into the path of the ego car."
