        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, several road users have been identified. On the right side of the road, there is a line of construction vehicles, including wheel loaders and a possible dump truck. These vehicles are either stationary or moving slowly in a convoy, occupying part of the lane and the shoulder. They could limit maneuverable space and may engage in unexpected movements or stops due to potential road work, leading to obstructions or reduced lanes.\n\nAdditionally, a green public transport bus is visible in the distance ahead, positioned on the right side of the road, seemingly at a bus stop or in traffic. The bus may start moving or stop to pick up and drop off passengers, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust speed or change lanes accordingly. Since buses frequently stop and may offload passengers, the ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop if the bus is at a bus stop and watch out for pedestrians.\n\nA motorcyclist is also ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. Being less stable and more vulnerable than enclosed vehicles, the motorcyclist requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance. The motorcyclist may adjust their speed or change lanes to navigate through the construction zone, necessitating the ego car's readiness to react.\n\nNo physical barriers are visible in the image, but the positioning of construction vehicles implies a potential work zone that acts as a de facto barrier. This work zone might disrupt the normal flow of traffic, requiring the ego vehicle to be vigilant and possibly take a detour."

The presence of a school bus might indicate a need for increased caution, as there may be children boarding or alighting from the bus.

These are often used in construction or maintenance projects for moving materials. The presence of construction machinery on or adjacent to the roadway typically suggests ongoing work and potential hazards, such as road obstructions or workers nearby. As a result, the ego car should proceed with caution, be prepared for possible detours or reduced speed zones, and be vigilant for workers and other construction-related traffic controls.",

It is a heavy equipment machine used in construction to move or load materials such as asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, snow, feed, gravel, logs, raw minerals, recycled material, rock, sand, woodchips, etc. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this vehicle as it may make unexpected movements or stop suddenly while operating in or near the roadway.

Prepare to stop or maneuver around the construction vehicles on the right side of the road if necessary. Stay aware of the bus ahead that might either merge back into traffic or make a stop to pick up passengers, indicating a possible need to change lanes to maintain safe travel. The ego vehicle should ensure safe following distance from the motorcyclist, reduce speed due to the obstructed lane and potentially slippery road conditions, and be attentive to any signs of movement from the construction vehicles. Additionally, it should be ready to stop for passengers alighting from the bus if there is a bus stop ahead. Passing the construction vehicles may require waiting until the opposite lane is clear and it is safe to do so."
