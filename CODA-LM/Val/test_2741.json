The car is parked and not an immediate threat, but the ego car should be cautious of any sudden movement from parked cars."

The traffic cones guide the ego car to stay in the left portion of the lane and alert it to potential road work or obstacles.

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and objects that the ego car must consider while navigating:\n\nFirstly, there is a white van parked on the right side of the road, stationary and parallel to the road. The parked van could obscure the ego car's view of potential hazards that may emerge from the parking area or sidewalk, and there is a risk of passengers exiting the vehicle unexpectedly.\n\nSecondly, a red vehicle is also parked ahead on the right, parallel to the road, which may reduce the width of the driving lane available to the ego car. The ego car needs to be cautious when passing by, as sudden movements from the vehicle, such as doors opening or the vehicle pulling out, could pose a risk.\n\nFurthermore, there is a person wearing reflective clothing standing near the edge of the road by a traffic cone. This individual might step onto the road, prompting the ego car to decelerate and be ready to stop. Reflective clothing typically signifies roadwork or an emergency, and the presence of a pedestrian near the driving lane requires heightened vigilance from the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, several traffic cones are positioned on the right edge of the lane. The cones are an indicator of a possible road hazard or ongoing roadwork and suggest that the ego car should slow down and potentially prepare to alter its course.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in the image. Therefore, the ego car's immediate considerations are limited to the parked vehicles, pedestrian, and traffic cones present within its vicinity."

Be vigilant for any actions from the person near the traffic cones and be prepared to stop or swerve to the left to avoid hazards. Monitor the environment for any new developments and adjust the driving strategy accordingly. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to maneuver delicately, giving wide berth to the reflective-gear-wearing person and the parked vehicles to avoid any collision. The car should remain alert to any changes within the cordoned-off area and be ready to adapt to unexpected hazards or road workers. Use of low-beam headlights is also advised to preserve visibility for the worker and oncoming traffic. The ego car should maintain a safe speed and be prepared to slow down due to the presence of the parked vehicles and the pedestrian. The car should also keep to the left side of the lane, away from the parked cars and the pedestrian, to allow a margin of safety. Additionally, the vehicle should watch for any signs of movement from the pedestrian and parked vehicles, as well as pay attention to the potential hazard indicated by the traffic cone."
