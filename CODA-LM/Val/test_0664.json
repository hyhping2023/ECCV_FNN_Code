The presence of the police car indicates that there might be an incident up ahead or an ongoing law enforcement action, which could disrupt the traffic flow and necessitates cautious driving.\n\nAdjacent to the ego vehicle's lane and extending towards the central divider, a line of orange traffic cones has been placed. These traffic cones signal a boundary that indicates a lane closure or a construction zone, requiring vehicles to merge to the left to circumvent the blockage.\n\nConcrete barriers are positioned on the right side of the traffic cones, demarcating the separation between the highway and the adjacent lower road or area. The barriers serve as protection for any road workers or pedestrians which might be close by, out of the immediate view.\n\nAdditionally, a metal barrier is installed along the left side of the road, marking the roadside boundary and preventing access to the area next to the driver's side. This barrier limits the ability to move laterally to avoid obstacles, demanding that any such maneuvers be carried out with an awareness of this confinement.\n\nNo other road users or objects pertinent to the driving behavior of the autonomous car are described in the other categories, as indicated by the absence of entries in the respective sections for vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other objects."

Maintain a safe following distance from the police car, be attentive to any sudden stops or changes, and prepare for possible instructions indicated by the police officers. Stay in the current lane, observing the traffic cones, and do not attempt to overtake the police car without clear indication that it is safe to do so. Reduce speed if necessary to ensure the safety of all road users and the compliance with any potential road regulations that may be enforced ahead."
