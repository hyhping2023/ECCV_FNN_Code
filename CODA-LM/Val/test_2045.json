Additionally, the truck's orientation indicates it may be turning or maneuvering, further necessitating the ego car to be prepared to stop or change lanes.\n\nTo the left of the ego car, a black car is driving parallel, informing us of an adjacent lane and the potential for the vehicle to change lanes, which the ego car must consider, especially if a lane change is needed due to the obstructing truck. \n\nAn overhead blue traffic sign provides navigational information about upcoming services and indicates an upcoming right turn onto an expressway, possibly requiring the ego car to plan for a future lane change.\n\nOrange traffic cones narrow the car's lane and signal road work or the need for a lane merger, imposing the requirement for caution and potentially slower speeds for the ego car. This situation is compounded by wooden barrier boards across the lane's width, indicating a lane closure and necessitating a lane change to proceed along the route.\n\nThe scene does not feature vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects that might impact the ego car's driving decisions."

The ego car should monitor the black car's position to change lanes safely. Additionally, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck in front, due to its open cargo area and the potential for objects to fall out. The presence of traffic cones and barriers signals a need for heightened awareness and a readiness to comply with any road work signage or traffic direction that may appear. Before changing lanes, the ego car should use its sensors to ensure there is enough space and that it won't cause any danger to the black sedan or any other road users that may be in the blind spot. Use of turn signals is important to communicate the intention to other drivers."
