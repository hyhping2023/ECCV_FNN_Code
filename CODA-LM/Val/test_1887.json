Directly in front of the ego car is a white pickup truck, likely moving at a constant speed as indicated by its inactive brake lights. This vehicle's presence dictates the ego car's following distance and speed adjustment to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, a concrete mixer truck is visible ahead on the same road, occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The mixer truck not only obstructs the view of the road ahead but also presents a risk due to its slower stopping capability and the potential for debris to fall from its mixer, requiring the ego vehicle to increase following distance.\n\nThere's a green traffic light to the right, allowing the ego car to proceed, but still, the ego vehicle should remain observant for any shifts in the traffic signal or sudden road changes.\n\nFurthermore, barriers or road works are present on the boundary of the concrete mixer truck's lane, which could disrupt traffic flow, possibly prompting a lane change or a drop in speed for the ego vehicle.\n\nFinally, there are various commercial billboards and signage on the roadside, which are not traffic signs and, hence, have no immediate impact on the ego vehicle's maneuvering decisions."

Prepare to decelerate if the truck's behavior changes. Keep an eye on the concrete mixer truck to the left, as its presence could affect lateral maneuver options. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car should proceed with caution through the intersection, being mindful of the surrounding traffic and ready to respond to any sudden changes. The ego car should also be prepared to change lanes if the barriers ahead would obstruct the current lane or if the truck's travel speed impedes the flow of traffic."
