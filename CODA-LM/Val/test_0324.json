The ego car should be prepared to reduce speed or stop as needed. Additionally, a vehicle is approaching the intersection from the opposite side with headlights on, potentially affecting left-hand turn maneuvers that the ego vehicle may make and warranting extra caution.\n\nThere are no pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity, hence there's no immediate concern for vulnerable road user-related maneuvers.\n\nTraffic signs on the right include a blue directional sign indicating a junction or turn-off, multiple signs that seem to relate to construction or lane shifts, and specific notifications of a left lane closure. These direct the ego carâ€™s navigation, lane choice, and speed adjustments.\n\nRed traffic lights at the intersection mandate that the ego vehicle must stop and wait for the signal to turn green before continuing.\n\nTraffic cones are set up along lane dividers and around a construction area on the left, signaling lane closures or road work ahead. There are further cones delineating a taper to guide vehicles away from the work zone on the left, indicating that the ego vehicle should keep right.\n\nConstruction barriers extend from where the cones end on the left into the ego vehicle's lane, with one partially obstructing the lane and another series of concrete barriers demarcating the construction zone from the drivable area. These necessitate cautious navigation to prevent collisions and are accompanied by reflective markers and roadwork signs to enhance visibility and guide traffic safely past the work site."

Use caution to navigate around the cones and barriers, and be prepared for potential stops or diversions due to the roadwork. The ego vehicle should also watch for oncoming traffic when at the intersection and be mindful of any changes in the road layout indicated by signage. Merging away from the cones and barriers where the lane is closing will be necessary for the safety and smooth traffic flow. The driving behavior should be cautious and at a speed appropriate for the possibly reduced visibility and road conditions at night."
