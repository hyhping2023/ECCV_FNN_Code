It is positioned on the right side of the road, either stationary or moving at a low speed under a bridge. This vehicle occupies part of the right lane, and its presence could disrupt the flow of traffic, potentially requiring the ego car to change lanes or adjust its speed to accommodate.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 'No Parking' or 'No Stopping' sign visible on the right side of the road. It is identified by a red circle with a blue background and a red slash across it. This sign serves as a warning that stopping or parking is not allowed in this area, and the ego car must not perform any maneuvers that involve stopping or parking along this stretch.\n\nFurthermore, permanent metal railing barriers are installed on both sides of the road. These barriers serve to separate the roadway from the surrounding environment and ensure that vehicles, including the ego car, remain within the boundaries of the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

It suggests that there may be litter collection services or waste disposal operations in this area. The presence of a garbage bag on the side of the road is relevant to the driving behavior as the driver of the ego car should remain vigilant for garbage collection personnel or vehicles that may be stopped or slow-moving as they perform their duties. It may necessitate a minor deviation from the current path or a reduction in speed to ensure the safety of service personnel and to comply with local traffic regulations pertaining to waste collection.",

The road conditions appear clear, so the car can proceed at a normal speed while monitoring for any changes in the traffic scenario."
