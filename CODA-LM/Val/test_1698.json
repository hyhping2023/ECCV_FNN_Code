This car is partially blocking the lane, which means that any vehicle, including the autonomous car, must navigate carefully around the parked car, particularly when there is oncoming traffic, as the available space for maneuvering is reduced.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green trash can situated on the left side of the road. While this object may not pose a direct threat to the vehicle's path, it requires attention as it could potentially narrow the safe passage way, especially if there are pedestrians around or if the trash can is closer to the road than it appears."
