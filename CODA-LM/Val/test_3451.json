The truck has a white cab and a yellow body with 'SANY' written on the boom arm. This truck, due to its size and position on the road, may reduce the maneuverability of the ego vehicle and could potentially make sudden movements or stops. Additionally, a white sedan is visible in the right-most lane, slightly ahead of the crane. The presence of this sedan in the adjacent lane will be a factor if the ego vehicle decides to change lanes to navigate around the crane.\n\nMoreover, the traffic light is not visible, making it crucial to proceed with caution. The image does not contain pedestrian, cyclist, or motorcyclist activity, nor are there any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present."

Given its size and the nature of its work, it may occupy multiple lanes and could obstruct the flow of traffic, requiring the ego car to slow down, maintain a safe distance, or potentially change lanes to avoid passing too closely to the operational area of the construction vehicle.",

Do not attempt to overtake unless the adjacent lane is clear and it is safe to do so. Reduce vehicle speed to account for wet road conditions and anticipate increased stopping distances. Stay in the current lane if possible to avoid the crane truck's blind spots and ensure clear visibility ahead. Without visibility of the traffic light, the ego car should approach intersections with extra caution and be prepared to stop or yield as necessary."
