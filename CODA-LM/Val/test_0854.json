It is described as having a red and white articulated boom arm extended into the air and occupies most of the road width. The presence of this construction vehicle is significant as it obstructs the path of the ego car. It is likely performing work that necessitates the temporary closure of the road. Consequently, this will prevent the ego car from passing on this side of the road and will require the ego car to alter its course to avoid a collision. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

The presence of this vehicle on or near the roadway indicates ongoing construction work. Its large size and extended machinery require caution and awareness from the ego car's driver. Due to its operation, the ego car may need to slow down, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for potential obstructions or changes in the traffic pattern.",

If there is an available lane to the left or right which is clear and safe to enter, the ego car should signal and change lanes cautiously to bypass the construction vehicle while maintaining awareness of any other possible road users or obstacles. If no such lane is available, the ego car should come to a safe stop and wait for directions from a construction worker or for the obstruction to clear if temporary. For long-term obstructions, seeking an alternative route may be necessary. Checking for any additional signage or personnel providing guidance around the construction site would be advisable."
