The truck's presence may impact visibility and road space during lane changes due to its size and potential blind spots. Additionally, several vehicles are parked by the roadside, with one driving away from the opposite side. Parked vehicles require maintaining a safe distance to prevent sudden encounters with pedestrians or car doors opening unexpectedly.\n\nA pedestrian with a dog is crossing the street on the crosswalk in front of our car, requiring us to yield until they have safely crossed. Another pedestrian is walking along the left sidewalk in the same direction as our car, necessitating readiness to stop if they suddenly step onto the street.\n\nTwo traffic lights are visible, both showing red, indicating that the vehicle must stop and wait for them to change.\n\nLastly, the sun is directly above the horizon, creating glare and potentially reducing visibility. This necessitates potentially recalibrating the vehicle's sensors for brightness and requires extra caution from the driver or autonomous system."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red traffic light, vehicles should come to a complete stop and wait for pedestrians to safely cross the road. Drivers should remain vigilant for oncoming vehicles that may obstruct their view, such as the truck on the left. Once the pedestrians have crossed and the traffic light turns green, drivers should proceed with caution, especially since vehicles parked along the road may obstruct their view and necessitate a sudden stop. Even when the green light is on, vehicles should not start moving if pedestrians have not yet left the hazardous area. Drivers should also pay special attention to reduced visibility caused by sunlight reflection. Do not change lanes to the right side of a large truck, and carefully overtake parked vehicles ahead only when it is safe to do so.",
