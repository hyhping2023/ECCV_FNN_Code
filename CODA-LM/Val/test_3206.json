A large truck with an oversized cylindrical load is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane and traveling in the same direction. The truck's size and load could limit visibility ahead, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain an increased following distance to react to traffic changes.\n2. A white van is on the right side of the road, appearing stationary or moving slowly with personnel around it. This situation may necessitate caution and potentially a lane change by the ego vehicle to avoid the van and personnel.\n3. Various cars are on the left side of the road, some parked and others possibly moving. The ego car should be prepared for these vehicles possibly pulling out into traffic or opening their doors.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users:\n1. Two workers wearing high visibility clothing - one beside the van on the right and one in the road median to the left. These workers may enter the roadway unexpectedly, requiring the ego car to be ready to slow down or stop to ensure their safety.\n\nThe traffic light ahead at the intersection is currently green for the ego carâ€™s direction. This indicates the ego car can proceed, but it should maintain readiness to stop in case the light changes.\n\nConcerning other objects, there is some smoke or fog towards the left side of the road, partially obscuring vision. This reduced visibility could conceal other road users or obstacles, necessitating a reduction in speed and increased scanning for unexpected hazards."
