The discernible traffic controls are a single yield sign and some elements that are indicating road changes or closures.\n\nSpecifically, there is a yield sign on the right side of the road, which is instructive for the autonomous vehicle – or ego car – to be prepared to slow down and give way to any oncoming traffic that has preference on the main road. This is critical to comply with traffic rules and for the safety of all road users.\n\nMoreover, the road ahead is not passable due to several red and white traffic cones arranged in a sequence, coupled with red and white barriers that span across the entire road, clearly signaling that the roadway is closed to traffic. This situation necessitates that the ego car must halt or devise an alternate path to continue its journey.\n\nNo other objects, traffic lights, or any additional road users are mentioned in the data, suggesting that their absence or irrelevance in this particular driving context."

The ego vehicle must not attempt to navigate around or through the barriers. It is essential to follow the official detour or turn around where safe to do so."
