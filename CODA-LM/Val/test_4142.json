Additionally, constant vigilance for the pedestrian's intentions is crucial, as they might enter the roadway. The ego car should also be prepared to respond to the traffic light ahead; reducing speed as it approaches the intersection could be prudent to accommodate for any potential stop signals. Moreover, keeping a watchful eye on any potential movement from the parked truck or from behind the barriers is important for proactive driving decisions. The ego car should be wary of potential incursions from both the parked truck and the vehicle entering from the off-road to the right side. Lastly, as the ego car approaches the overhead sign, the driver or autonomous system should be ready to read and react to the sign's instructions."
