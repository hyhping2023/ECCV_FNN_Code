The presence of these vehicles requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to any potential changes in their behavior, such as slowing down, stopping, or changing lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple construction workers on the right side of the road, easily identifiable by their high visibility clothing. Due to their proximity to the roadway, there is a risk they might enter the driving lane, which necessitates the ego car to be cautious and possibly reduce speed to ensure safety.\n\nWhile there are no traffic signs visible in the image that indicate any restrictions or warnings, and thus no specific actions are required in this regard, the absence of traffic lights also means there is no need for the ego car to respond to such signals.\n\nThe image does show orange traffic cones lined up along the right-hand side of the road, signaling the boundaries of a construction zone. This setup indicates that the ego car may need to merge to the left and proceed with increased caution due to the reduced lane width and nearby construction activities.\n\nTemporary construction barriers and fences are also present to the right, delineating the construction area's limits. These barriers are crucial for directing the flow of traffic away from the construction zone and indicating areas that are off-limits.\n\nLastly, there is construction equipment and materials scattered around the work site on the right. These items could pose a hazard if they were to end up on the roadway; therefore, it is recommended that the ego car keep a safe distance from the work zone to avoid any unexpected obstacles."
