The bus may make unexpected stops or turns, particularly near schools or designated bus stops, which could affect traffic flow and the ego car's driving decisions."

        "description and explanation": "The scene consists of a yellow school bus and a red and white barrier observable in proximity to the ego car. The school bus is positioned ahead on the right side, though details of its appearance are somewhat obscured possibly due to motion and camera focus. Being a large vehicle, it is particularly relevant as it has the potential to stop abruptly, most likely for student pick-ups or drop-offs. This behavior is critical for the ego car's following distance and stopping strategies, requiring careful attention to adapt to the bus's sudden stops or turns, which is common near schools or bus stops.\n\nAdditionally, a red and white barrier is noticeable in the lower right corner of the image. This barrier likely serves as a warning for upcoming road closures or construction work, suggesting an adjustment in the driving path might be necessary. It alerts the ego car to the possibility of having to change lanes or slow down to safely navigate the area.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the image, and thus have no bearing on the ego car's driving conditions in this scenario."

Drivers approaching a school bus must exercise caution, especially if the bus is stopped, as children may be boarding or alighting. In many regions, it is required by law to stop when a school bus has its stop sign extended and red lights flashing.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of the school bus ahead, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop suddenly. Due to the potential lane closure indicated by the barrier, the ego car should also be ready to merge left if necessary and should proceed with caution, preparing for possible roadwork or detours ahead. Monitor relative speed to ensure that it's suitable for the road conditions and traffic situation. Lowering speed and increasing vigilance are recommended safety measures in school zones or when school buses are present."
