Even though the vehicle is not blocking the lane, it is important to be aware of it, as there may be sudden movements or doors opening, which could affect the ego vehicle's trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, large cable spools are stored on the side of the road, adjacent to the buildings. They could create visual obstructions that hide potential hazards such as pedestrians crossing behind them. Therefore, the ego vehicle should maintain a cautious speed while passing by.\n\nAlso located near the roadside are large industrial spools, which, though currently stationary, could become a hazard if they were to roll onto the roadway. Despite being stationary, the potential for these objects to become obstacles means their presence should be consistently monitored."

Its significant size and the fact that it is situated off the roadway imply that it is stored on private property or a storage facility. For the ego vehicle, this object does not directly impact driving behavior since it is not on the public roadway and does not pose an immediate hazard. However, in a broader context, its presence suggests the ego vehicle is in an industrial or commercial area where extra caution should be exercised due to the possible presence of heavy machinery or transport vehicles associated with industrial activities.",
