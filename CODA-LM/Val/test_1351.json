        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a fleet of yellow service trucks in the right lane, each with distinctive markings and activated warning lights, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The presence of this fleet suggests that they might engage in activities that could slow down or stop traffic, or they might perform unpredictable actions due to the nature of their service. Consequently, our vehicle may need to change lanes or adjust speed to safely navigate around these trucks.\n\nAhead in the same lane, there is also a white bus that is traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Buses are known to make frequent stops, which poses a potential for sudden deceleration or complete stopping, making it crucial for nearby vehicles to maintain a safe following distance. It is important to be alert and ready to maneuver around the bus when it makes these stops.\n\nAdditionally, the road contains green fences and trees planted on the central divider, which, while not being direct obstacles, do restrict the available width of the roadway. These barriers serve the important function of delineating the road boundaries and ensure that vehicles do not cross over into the lane of oncoming traffic, thereby promoting a safer driving environment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from service vehicles. If the vehicle suddenly decelerates or stops, be prepared to change lanes to the left. Keep a safe distance from buses and watch their signal lights to anticipate any stops or turns they might make. Continue to observe any changes in road traffic patterns or the appearance of other road users. If there are traffic cones or signs indicating a lane closure ahead, prepare to merge safely and promptly into an open lane. Simultaneously, ensure to pay attention to any instructions from traffic personnel on the road. Watch for sudden braking or lane changes from vehicles ahead and adjust your speed accordingly to maintain a safe following distance. If it is safe to do so, consider moving to the left lane, providing more space to handle parked vehicles.",
