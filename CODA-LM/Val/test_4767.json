Vehicles:\n   - A van is stopped on the right side of the road with its rear doors open and several people around it, engaged in either loading or unloading. This situation may hinder the smooth movement of traffic. Additionally, the possibility that those individuals might step onto the road unexpectedly requires the ego car to proceed with caution.\n   - There are other cars parked further down the road on the same side as the van. While they are stationary and not an immediate concern for the ego car, their presence is still worth noting.\n\n2. Vulnerable Road Users:\n   - The group of people around the parked van could present a hazard as they may enter the driving path unexpectedly. The ego car must keep a close watch on these road users.\n   - A cyclist is also present ahead on the road, riding in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist is on the left of the lane and might need to be passed carefully, providing ample room to ensure safety.\n\n3. Barriers:\n   - There is a physical barrier on the left side of the road that delineates the separate lanes for opposing traffic flows and restricts the ego vehicle from making improper left turns or entering the oncoming traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects that need to be taken into consideration in this scenario."

Additionally, the car should continue to stay in the right-hand lane due to the presence of the physical barrier to the left, which inhibits the ability to cross into the oncoming traffic lane."
