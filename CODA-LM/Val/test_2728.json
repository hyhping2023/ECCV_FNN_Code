    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and prepare to change lanes to the left when it is safe to do so, in order to avoid the white sedan that is merging and pedestrians in the right lane. At the same time, drivers should also be ready to stop or slow down at any moment due to potential road work indicated by the conditions ahead and construction vehicles. The driver must remain vigilant and look out for any possible road work signs or signals that may currently be out of sight. Slow down and prepare to stop. Be aware of the white sedan's potential lane-changing actions and be ready to adjust the vehicle's path accordingly. Watch out for pedestrians moving to the side of the road next to the red vehicle and maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. The vehicle should consider moving into the left lane to circumvent the improperly positioned white sedan and the grey van with its doors open on the right. However, caution is advised due to large vehicles obstructing the right lane. In light of vehicle queues and activities along the roadside, it is advisable to slow down and be prepared for stop-and-go traffic. The vehicle should maintain a high level of situational awareness to respond to the activities of road users and potential obstacles ahead.",
