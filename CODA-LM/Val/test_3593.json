        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, we observe a construction vehicle directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. It is characterized by yellow caution striping and is either stationary or advancing at a slow pace. Due to this construction vehicle, the autonomy of the ego car is directly impacted as it suggests the presence of a work zone, which may involve lane closures, reduced speed limits, and workers on the road, hence affecting the ego car's route and speed choices.\n\nDespite a green traffic light ahead, which typically would allow the ego car to proceed, the situation is complicated by the construction vehicle's presence. The green light indicates the right of way to continue forward, yet the driver must assess if the path is indeed clear, considering the potential work zone conditions.\n\nAdditionally, barriers are present on the right side of the road, demarcating a construction area. These barriers likely mean that portions of the roadway or shoulder are inaccessible, prompting the ego car to approach with increased care to adapt to the potentially reduced driving space.\n\nThe scene's visibility is limited by darkness, concealing any peripheral objects. This lack of visibility further necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, as the dark conditions combined with the construction setting may hide unexpected hazards."

Additionally, adapt to the possible reduced visibility and potentially slippery road surface by maintaining a lower speed and extending the following distance to the vehicle ahead."
