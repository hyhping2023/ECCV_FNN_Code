The behavior of this vehicle will determine the safe following distance and may affect the lane choice and speed of the ego vehicle. Additionally, a series of black traffic cones are placed diagonally to the left in front of the vehicle, marking the boundary for a work area or lane closure.

It should continue in the current lane, following behind the traffic cones, and only change lanes when it is safe to do so and when indicated. Proceed with caution while following the restricted path defined by the traffic cones. Maintain a safe speed that allows for an immediate response to the sudden movements of stopped vehicles or potential hazards that may appear in the restricted area. Be prepared to stop or maneuver the vehicle if necessary.",
