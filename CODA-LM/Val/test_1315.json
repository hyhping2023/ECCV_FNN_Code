        "description and explanation": "In the image, there are several vehicles in view. To the left, a white van is situated just ahead of our vehicle. It's not clear whether the van is moving or stopped, but its position is critical as it influences our vehicle's potential to change lanes to the left or to accelerate. Directly in front of our vehicle in the right lane, there's a blue flatbed truck. Its brake lights are engaged, signaling that it might be slowing down or has come to a stop. The truck's behavior dictates the following distance and speed our vehicle should maintain. Furthermore, there's a yellow excavator being carried on a heavy truck in the far-right lane. This large vehicle is either stationary or moving at a slow pace. Due to its size, there's a risk of hazards which means our vehicle will need to allow for a longer following distance and proceed with cautious driving to anticipate any sudden stops or blocked views.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the autonomous driving conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, watch for any signs of lane changing from the van on the left, and prepare to respond according to the status of the traffic light as you approach the intersection. Be cautious of larger vehicles ahead (such as heavy trucks carrying excavators) due to their size and potential blind spots, requiring a wider safety margin. Go with the flow of traffic, and do not attempt to overtake unless the left lane is confirmed to be clear and safe. Additionally, drivers should always be ready to respond to changes in road signs and traffic lights. If the driver intends to change lanes, they must do so with caution, ensuring there is ample space and it is safe to proceed.",

This type of heavy equipment is commonly used in construction, likely indicating construction activity nearby. For the ego car, this suggests potential construction-related traffic delays or detours ahead. The vehicle's presence may require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, be alert for sudden stops or slow-moving traffic, and obey any posted construction signs or flagger instructions.",
