This vehicle potentially obstructs the flow of traffic and creates a hazard, particularly if it moves slowly or stops unexpectedly. It may obstruct the path of the ego vehicle, necessitating the ego car to yield or possibly stop. Additionally, this vehicle is occupying the lane for oncoming traffic, presenting a reversing or turning hazard that could impact the ego carâ€™s trajectory.\n\nThe traffic lights for the direction the ego car is facing display a red light. This indicates that the ego car must stop at the intersection and wait until the light turns green before proceeding. The red traffic light requires all vehicles, including the ego car, to come to a complete stop, and the ego car must remain stationary until the light changes to green."

Its presence on the road typically indicates nearby construction work. When driving, the ego car must maintain a safe distance from this vehicle to allow for its large turning radius and the possibility of sudden stops or movements related to construction activity.

It is also advisable to maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle and remain alert for any sudden stops or turns it may make, especially since it is occupying multiple lanes and its arm is extended. The ego car should wait for the traffic light to turn green and monitor the construction vehicle's movement before continuing through the intersection. Additionally, the driver should be aware of any directional changes signaled by the traffic lights and be prepared for alterations in the normal traffic pattern due to the presence of the construction vehicle."
