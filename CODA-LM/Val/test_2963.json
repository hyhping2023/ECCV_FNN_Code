On the right side of the road, a bus is parked partially on the curb with its front facing the ego vehicle. This bus may reduce visibility for any oncoming traffic and could also present obstacles if passengers are disembarking. Additionally, there are several cars parked along the curb on the right side of the road, which narrow the available driving lane and necessitate that the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance to avoid collisions.\n\nIn the lower right corner of the image, a traffic light shows a green arrow pointing to the right. This green arrow permits the ego vehicle to make a right turn, although caution is advised due to the presence of the parked bus and potential oncoming traffic."
