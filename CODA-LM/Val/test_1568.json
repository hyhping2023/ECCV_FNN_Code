    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light, this vehicle should come to a complete stop before the pedestrian crosswalk. The driver should monitor the movements of construction vehicles, cyclists crossing the street, and pedestrians waiting on the sidewalk to ensure safe navigation once the traffic light turns green. Vigilance should be maintained, paying attention to possible instructions from construction workers or temporary traffic signs not captured in images. Given the wet road conditions, the vehicle should proceed cautiously when the light turns green, avoiding rapid acceleration that could lead to skidding, and stay alert for signals when it is safe to pass construction vehicles.",

            "description and explanation": "A large wheeled construction vehicle equipped with a front-mounted loader bucket. This machinery is commonly used for heavy lifting and earthmoving tasks at construction sites. In a traffic context, spotting such a vehicle would suggest caution as construction activities may be ongoing, and the vehicle might make sudden or wide movements. The ego car should slow down, maintain a safe distance, and be ready to stop if the construction vehicle enters the roadway or if there is construction-related traffic direction happening.",
