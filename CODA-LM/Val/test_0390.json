The presence and operational nature of this large vehicle could lead to slower movement, potentially affecting traffic flow and possibly necessitating lane changes for vehicles traveling behind it.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side of the road, there are parked cars. While these vehicles are not obstructing the flow of traffic, they could obscure the view of any pedestrians or unexpected obstacles that might come onto the road.\n\nThere is also a trash bin placed on the sidewalk to our left. However, it appears to be properly positioned outside the roadway, and thus it does not present a direct risk to our vehicle or influence our driving decisions."

Before overtaking, monitor the traffic conditions on the opposite lane to ensure it's safe to proceed. Also, pay attention to any movements in the parked vehicle queue on the right, such as doors opening or pedestrians stepping out. Stay alert to surrounding traffic to ensure a safe lane change.
