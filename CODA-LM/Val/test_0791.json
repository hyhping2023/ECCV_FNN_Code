To the left, a car is in motion with its headlights on, crossing the path anticipated by our vehicle, posing a potential danger of intersection collision. To the right, slightly ahead, another car with its headlights on is moving in the same direction, which may lead to a risk if one of the vehicles changes lanes or suddenly decelerates.\n\nOn the left side, parked cars line up along the edge of the road behind this car, narrowing the available road width and presenting the risk of sudden door openings or pedestrians stepping out unexpectedly.\n\nDirectly ahead of our vehicle, a motorcyclist wearing a yellow jacket is traveling in the same direction, posing a risk due to their smaller size and potential for sudden movements. Also ahead, a cyclist in yellow clothing moves parallel to a turning vehicle in the same lane, necessitating heightened caution due to the cyclist's vulnerability and lower visibility.\n\nAdditionally, on the left side near the curb, a red and white traffic barrier delineates the driving area, which dictates the road space available for driving and necessitates maintaining a safe distance.\n\nAs for visibility, a streetlight illuminates the scene from above, aiding in the identification of road users. However, varied environmental lighting from buildings and streetlights causes different levels of visibility, making vigilance critical for our vehicle to correctly spot and respond to other participants in the traffic environment."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and monitor vehicles crossing from the left side, anticipating their trajectory, and yield when necessary. Attention must be paid to recognize any potential traffic control devices or signs that may be obscured due to poor image quality or other factors. Additionally, if the behavior of motorcyclists indicates possible maneuvers, the vehicle should be ready to decelerate, avoiding any lane changes that could bring it too close to other vehicles or obstacles. Continuously scanning for any unpredictable behavior by motorcyclists, as well as vigilance for stationary parked vehicles, is crucial for safe navigation. Considering the urgent approach and maneuvering of turning vehicles and bicyclists, the vehicle should also be prepared to stop to avoid collisions if necessary, activate hazard warning lights to alert other road users, monitor oncoming traffic when navigating around obstacles, and drive carefully on potentially slippery road surfaces.",
