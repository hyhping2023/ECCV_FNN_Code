The headlights are on, suggesting the presence of a driver who might be preparing to join the traffic. This requires caution and readiness to yield if needed.\n  - In the distance on the left side of the image, a yellow taxi with a roof light is visible. It is facing in the direction of our car and doesn't pose an immediate obstruction, but it should be monitored.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A motorcyclist with a sidecar is positioned very close to the main vehicle, right in its path. This requires special attention due to the motorcycle's potential instability and difficulty to see.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Bright orange traffic cones are placed diagonally in front of the vehicle to the right. These likely indicate a lane closure or obstruction and direct the traffic to move to the left. Autonomous vehicles need to respond carefully by possibly changing lanes or adjusting routes.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects observed in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and prepare to navigate around traffic cones, maintaining a safe distance from the parked white sedan. The driving path might need to be adjusted to avoid the cones and account for the potential movement of the white sedan. Continuous monitoring of the surroundings is crucial, especially in low visibility conditions. The vehicle should also turn on its headlights, and possibly fog lights, to enhance visibility and ensure it is seen by other road users. Given the proximity and position of the approaching motorcyclist in the middle of the road, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or yield. Moreover, the vehicle should monitor the parked white sedan for any signs that it might be about to move onto the road, such as brake lights or turn signals. As for the traffic cones on the left, the vehicle should ensure there is enough clearance to avoid them and change its driving path smoothly, without sudden movements. The presence of traffic cones suggests there might be construction or obstacles nearby, necessitating increased vigilance and readiness to respond to changing road conditions or directions from road workers.",
