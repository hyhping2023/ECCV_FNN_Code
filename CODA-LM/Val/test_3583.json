It is also important to keep a safe distance from the parked cars on the right in case they commence moving. Continuous observation of the traffic lights is necessary to comply with the signals once they become visible. Since the traffic cones and the person in high-visibility clothing might indicate ongoing work or a need for lane changes, the ego car should be prepared to reduce speed, and avoid the far right lane where the person is standing. Additionally, the ego car should observe the signs on the gantry for navigation purposes, and maintain a moderate speed that allows for safe maneuvering in response to the dynamic road conditions."
