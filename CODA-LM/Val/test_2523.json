        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, there is a large orange maintenance truck positioned directly in front of the vehicle, displaying clear signs and rear safety lights. This truck is occupying the same lane as our vehicle and has the potential to travel slowly, thus affecting our speed and following distance. Additionally, a motorcyclist is present, positioned on the left side of his bike. The motorcyclist's approach and potential lane changes or turns may affect the driving trajectory of our vehicle. In the distance, a traffic light can be seen emitting a yellow signal. The yellow light indicates that the signal is about to turn red; therefore, if it is safe to do so, given the distance and current speed, the vehicle should prepare to stop. Additionally, there is a bright light source on the left, which may affect the visibility of drivers on the road, including our vehicle's sensors. This intense light may cause distraction and temporary vision problems; hence, the autonomous vehicle should use its sensors to make appropriate adjustments."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given there is a large utility vehicle ahead, this vehicle should maintain a safe following distance. As the traffic light turns yellow, this vehicle should prepare to stop, unless it is close to the intersection and maintaining a constant speed is safer. Considering the presence of motorcycles, this vehicle should carefully monitor adjacent lanes before attempting to change lanes. Due to slippery road conditions, this vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to increase the braking distance. Caution is needed against bright light sources to ensure they do not interfere with the vehicle's sensor systems. It is recommended to slow down and change lanes to the left after confirming it is safe, as there are vehicles stopped ahead. Additionally, it is crucial to monitor the actions of motorcyclists, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for their possible sudden movements. Also, pay attention to any signs of road construction that might indicate obstacles and changes in traffic patterns.",

In a traffic scenario, the ego car should keep a safe distance from this vehicle due to its potential for making sudden stops or maneuvers, and the possible presence of construction activity nearby. Approaching this vehicle with caution is recommended, with the readiness to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, as it may obstruct the road or move slower than regular traffic.",

In the current driving scenario, the ego car must be vigilant for potential unpredictable movements from the cyclist and maintain a safe passing distance as required by local traffic laws. The presence of the cyclist dictates a need for the ego car to slow down if in close proximity and potentially change lanes to pass safely, while also considering other traffic and road conditions.",
