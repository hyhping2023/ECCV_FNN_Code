        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several vehicles and an obstruction identified on the road, each affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in different ways.\n\nFirstly, a white sedan is seen directly ahead of the ego car on the same lane, displaying brake lights that indicate it is slowing down or preparing to stop. Consequently, the ego car must also be ready to reduce speed or come to a halt in reaction to the lead vehicle's actions. Further ahead, multiple vehicles occupy both the left and right lanes, moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles play a role in determining the overall pace of traffic and might influence decisions related to lane choice or overtaking maneuvers. Additionally, a black SUV is spotted in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car and moving in the same direction. It necessitates that the ego car keep an eye on this vehicle for potential lane changes or adjustments in speed. Another dark-colored SUV is observed straddling the edge of the right lane and the shoulder of the road. It appears to be either pulling off the road or facing some issue, requiring the ego car driver to pay increased attention to any possible actions that the SUV might undertake.\n\nAside from vehicles, there is an obstruction on the road described as a large anomaly, akin to a pile of debris, positioned ahead on the ego car's lane. This obstruction dictates that the ego car prepares to either change lanes safely to avoid it, if possible, or to decelerate and wait for the road to clear if shifting lanes is not feasible.\n\nThe traffic image analysis provided gives no information on vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, implying their absence in the scene or lack of relevance to the ego car's immediate driving decisions."

Due to its position on the road and the potential for it to be moved by the wind or passing vehicles, the driver of the ego car should monitor its location carefully to avoid any sudden movements if the bag were to fly towards the vehicle, potentially obstructing visibility or causing a distraction. If the bag remains stationary or does not interfere with the trajectory of the car, the driver may continue without alteration to the driving behavior, keeping an eye on it to ensure it doesn't present a hazard to anyone on the road.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Based on the traffic scenario, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the white sedan in front, be prepared to reduce speed due to the vehicle's brake lights being on, and be vigilant for any sudden lane changes from adjacent vehicles. Furthermore, the ego car should plan to change lanes to avoid the obstruction on the road, doing so only after ensuring the adjacent lanes are clear of other traffic and it is safe to perform this maneuver. Monitor the vehicles ahead for any sudden changes in speed or direction they might induce on the flow of traffic. Keep an eye on the dark-colored SUV on the right for unpredicted behavior and be ready to react accordingly. Use the dry road conditions to carry out any maneuvers smoothly and safely, while observing the general traffic behaviour to decide if a lane change or overtaking is necessary and safe."
