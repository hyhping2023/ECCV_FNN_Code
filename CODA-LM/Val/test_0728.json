On the left side of the road, two forklifts are traveling in the same direction as the ego car, one following the other. The presence of these forklifts, along with their relatively slow speed, may affect the flow of traffic. As a result, the ego car may need to change lanes or adjust its speed to maintain a safe distance from them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a line of parked cars on the right side of the road. These cars are positioned parallel to the road and are not in motion. However, the ego car should remain vigilant for any sudden movements, such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging from between the parked cars.\n\nThere is also a white car in the right lane, facing the same direction as the ego car, which appears to be stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle could potentially influence the flow of traffic on the same road as the ego car.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are no visible signs in the immediate vicinity that can be observed from the image. This means the ego car must rely on standard road rules and carefully observe the behaviors of other road users to navigate safely.\n\nLastly, no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are visible in the image. The absence of traffic lights indicates that the ego car should navigate the intersection or road section based on road markings and established right-of-way rules, without the guidance of traffic light signals."

It is smaller in size compared to general on-road vehicles but is often heavier due to its construction and the weight of materials it may carry. This type of vehicle is not typically designed for high-speed travel but for carrying heavy loads at construction sites. When encountering such a vehicle on the road, it might be moving slower than traffic flow, and caution should be exercised.

Keep a watchful eye on the forklifts and be prepared to change lanes if necessary to overtake them safely. Regular checks for any pedestrians potentially emerging from between the parked cars on the right side are advisable. Continue to monitor the road for any additional road users that may affect travel. Proceed with caution, maintaining a slow speed due to potential wet road conditions. Stay alert for any unexpected movements from the stationary vehicles, particularly the forklifts which are in a position to merge or cross the ego car's path. Keep a safe distance from the parked cars on the right to allow room for maneuvering and potential door openings."
