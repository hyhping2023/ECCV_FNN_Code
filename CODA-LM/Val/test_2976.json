        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, multiple road users are identified, affecting the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles in diversified manners.\n\nPrimarily, vehicles play a significant role in shaping the driving dynamics of the scenario. A distinct yellow forklift is noted parked on the shoulder on the right side of the road, partially intruding into the rightmost lane with its forks oriented towards the road. This presence of a forklift not only obstructs the lane but also introduces a potential hazard as it might commence moving unpredictably, posing a risk to passing vehicles. In parallel, the left lane is dominated by several large trucks loaded with construction equipment. Due to their substantial loads, these trucks likely exhibit compromised speed and maneuverability, compelling self-driving cars to either decelerate or switch lanes ensuring the maintenance of safe driving conditions. In addition, a white sedan is observed maintaining a moderate distance ahead of the autonomous vehicle in the same lane. The positioning and pace of the sedan directly influence the immediate speed of the lane, necessitating autonomous vehicles to keep a safe distance to ensure secure navigation.\n\nFurthermore, the category of vulnerable road users features a worker operating a yellow forklift on the right side of the road, with the orientation facing the roadside. The activity of forklift operators, especially in proximity to roadways, introduces a potential hazard. Their unexpected entry onto the road or inadvertent operations can endanger the safety of nearby moving vehicles.\n\nIn this scenario, no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are identified, hence there's no need to consider their impact on autonomous driving behaviors within this specific snapshot.\n\nThis summarized input encapsulates the diverse interactions and considerations autonomous vehicles must account for within a given traffic situation, highlighting the complexity of real-world navigation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Decelerate appropriately to allow increased reaction time for potentially navigating around parked forklift trucks. Maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, and be prepared to change lanes when the truck in front reduces speed significantly, ensuring to check your rearview mirrors and blind spots beforehand. Stay alert to the movements of parked forklifts and other potential road hazards. Watch for any signals from stationary construction vehicles in case they move or commence operations, and be cautious of forklift operators who may enter the road from the right side. Driving slightly below the speed limit can provide additional time to respond to unforeseen events. Drivers should also be prepared to change lanes if necessary to maintain a safe distance from activities along the roadside, while monitoring the rearview mirrors for other vehicles that may be approaching at a higher speed or preparing to overtake.",

Since this type of vehicle is often associated with construction or maintenance activities, it might suggest the presence of a construction site nearby. The ego vehicle should be prepared for potential disruptions to traffic flow, such as reduced lanes or detours, and the presence of workers or equipment in the vicinity. Caution and a lower speed might be warranted to safely navigate past the area.",
