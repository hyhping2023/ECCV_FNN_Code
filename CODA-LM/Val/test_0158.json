Traffic Signs:\n   - A blue circular sign with a red cross indicates no parking or stopping. This informs drivers that they are not allowed to park or stop their vehicles in the area ahead.\n   - Directional signs above the road indicate lanes for 'Jiangnan Ave' to the right. These provide navigation information and lane designation, which could be important for route planning and lane choice.\n\n2. Traffic Lights:\n   - A traffic light is displaying a red signal at an intersection. This means vehicles must stop before the intersection and wait for the next signal change to proceed.\n\n3. Barriers:\n   - Fencing barriers along the sidewalk separate the pedestrian area from the roadway. These ensure that pedestrians do not accidentally enter the roadway, reducing the chance of incidents.\n\n4.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a bollard, a sturdy, vertical post designed to control or direct road traffic. It serves as a protective barrier that helps to prevent vehicles from entering specific areas, such as pedestrian zones or to deter ramming attacks. The bollard can also be used to control traffic patterns by designating particular lanes or restricting vehicle access to certain parts of the road. For the ego car, the presence of the bollard indicates that there may be areas off-limits to vehicular traffic, thereby informing the driver to remain on the correct path and avoid any restricted areas.",
