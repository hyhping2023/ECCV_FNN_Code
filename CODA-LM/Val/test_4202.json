        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image ahead, there are several notable road users and objects. About 100 meters ahead in the same lane, a white hatchback is spotted moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The autonomous driving system must consider the speed and trajectory of this vehicle to maintain a safe following distance or to decide whether overtaking is necessary if the hatchback's speed is lower than the traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple vehicles visible in the distance, traveling in various directions. The presence of these vehicles requires constant vigilance from the autonomous driving system so that it's ready to react to their potential maneuvers.\n\nAlongside these moving vehicles, a series of blue construction barriers are observed on the right side of the road, parallel to our lane. These barriers signal potential construction or roadwork ahead. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle may need to adjust its lateral position in the lane to maintain a safe distance from these obstructions.\n\nAdditionally, metal fencing lines the right side of the road, separating the sidewalk from the street, which is a measure to ensure that pedestrians stay clear of the road and vice versa. Although these barriers don't directly affect the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions, maintaining a safe distance from any roadside barrier is essential.\n\nOther stationary objects include metal railings and white protective barriers that delineate pedestrian boundaries on both sides of the road, aiming to reduce the likelihood of pedestrian-related accidents and allow the vehicle to concentrate on other vehicular traffic.\n\nLastly, a gas station on the right side could influence the behavior of vehicles that are either attempting to enter or exit the gas station. Our autonomous vehicle should remain alert to vehicles that might slow down to enter the gas station or merge into traffic after refueling.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones in view."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a steady speed and keep a safe distance from the white hatchback ahead. Be aware of possible activities at the gas station. As there are no special traffic signs, there is currently no need to change the driving status immediately. However, our vehicle should stay vigilant, always watch for changes in the traffic ahead, and comply with standard traffic rules. The construction barrier to the right indicates there may be roadwork ahead, so the driver should be prepared to slow down or adjust the lane position if necessary. Stay alert for the bus ahead as well; it may make frequent stops or cause slow traffic. If the traffic flow is affected, be prepared for possible stops or lane changes.",

The presence of a pedestrian close to the roadway requires the driver of the ego car to be alert and cautious, ready to stop or slow down if the pedestrian unexpectedly steps onto the road. Although the pedestrian is not currently on the street, their proximity to the curb necessitates attentive driving, adherence to speed limits, and preparedness for potential pedestrian crossing, ensuring the safety of all road users.",
