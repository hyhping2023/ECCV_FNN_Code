        "description and explanation": "The image analyzed presents a scene populated by vehicles and controlled by a traffic light, without the presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects. Specifically, the vehicles in view consist of several parked cars directly ahead of the ego car. These cars vary in color and model, and their position blocks the ego car's direct path while their shiny surfaces reflect the headlights, indicating the need for the ego car to navigate carefully to avoid collisions and maneuver safely through the available space. Additionally, there is another vehicle parked on the right side, white in color, which is parked alongside the curb. The position of this vehicle implies that the ego vehicle must ensure there is no movement from it as it passes by, to prevent any possible incident.\n\nFurthermore, a red traffic light is positioned on the right-hand side of the image, at a lower height than usual, signaling a stop command for vehicles facing its direction, including the ego car. This traffic light mandates that the ego car come to a complete halt and wait until the signal changes to green before it can proceed. This setup clearly dictates the precautions and actions required by the ego car to navigate the scene safely."

It is advisable to keep headlights and taillights on for visibility, and to use lower speeds to maintain control of the vehicle in case of unforeseen road users or obstacles."
