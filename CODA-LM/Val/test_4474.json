This truck may obstruct part of the road, and its size could cause visibility issues for other road users.\n\nSecondly, in the distance, there is a car with its red taillights turned on, facing away from our vehicle, indicating that it is moving away. The illuminated red taillights suggest the presence and direction of the car and confirm that it has not stopped, which is crucial for maintaining a safe following distance."

Maintain a safe distance from trucks and moving vehicles ahead, and be ready to stop or maneuver at any time to avoid stationary trucks that may suddenly become obstacles. Drivers should also stay alert for other road users who might be difficult to spot due to low light conditions. If a truck is blocking the lane, check the rearview mirrors and blind spots for a safe opportunity to change lanes and bypass the obstruction. When meeting oncoming traffic, dim the headlights to prevent glare and be prepared to adjust speed or position in response to trucks that may be partially blocking the driving lane.",
