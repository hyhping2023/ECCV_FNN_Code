Firstly, there is a concrete mixer truck ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. The truck's mixing drum is rotating, indicating that it is actively working. This large vehicle could affect the traffic flow and necessitates that the ego vehicle maintain a safe following distance due to the potential for sudden stops or slowing down.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white sedan in the right lane, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this sedan requires the ego vehicle to stay alert in case the sedan decides to change lanes.\n\nA yellow vehicle is also visible in the distance on the same lane. It is crucial to monitor this vehicle's speed and direction as it might influence the ego car's decisions regarding speed adjustment and lane choice.\n\nSeveral road signs are present on the right side ahead, but their details are unclear due to the distance and angle. The content of these traffic signs could contain important information for the ego car, such as speed limits or lane usage instructions, which will be necessary to observe as the vehicle gets closer.\n\nThe traffic lights for the direction of travel of the ego vehicle are showing red in the distance. This indicates that the ego vehicle will need to stop at the upcoming intersection, and therefore, a reduction in speed will be required as the vehicle approaches.\n\nLastly, there are median barriers separating the opposing traffic flows. These barriers dictate the driving path and prohibit any turns across the median, ensuring the safety of vehicles in both directions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

Prepare to stop for the red traffic light ahead, and account for possibly slippery conditions due to the wet road. Awareness of surrounding vehicles, particularly the white sedan, is essential to respond effectively to any sudden lane changes. Additionally, the ego vehicle should begin decelerating in anticipation of the red traffic light ahead, while being mindful of the potentially slippery road conditions. Following the traffic laws and adjusting the speed to the wet road surface are paramount safety considerations."
