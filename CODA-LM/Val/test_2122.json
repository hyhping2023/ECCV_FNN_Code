Stay alert for any possible movement from the cyclist and be prepared to yield if they enter the driving lane. Watch for potential glare due to shadows and keep headlights adjusted appropriately. Given the visible road users and traffic signals, the ego car should proceed with caution, ensuring to maintain a safe distance from the utility vehicle on the right. It should be prepared to stop if the green light changes, and be ready to yield to any pedestrians that may cross at the marked crossing. When passing the cyclist, the ego car should change to the left lane if possible and safe to do so, providing the cyclist ample space and reducing risk of collision."
