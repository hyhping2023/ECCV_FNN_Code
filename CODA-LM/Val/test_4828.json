A yellow taxi is noticed slightly ahead on the left side, occupying the adjacent lane. Its movements are important to monitor, as they could influence decisions regarding lane changes or speed adjustments for the self-driving vehicle.\n2. There is a truck parked on the right-hand side of the road with its rear extending into the traffic lane, effectively narrowing the lane and necessitating careful navigation around it to avoid any incidents.\n3. A red car is also visible to the right of the vehicle and seems to be either at a standstill or moving at a low speed. The car's presence requires vigilance since it may merge into the flow of traffic or suddenly open its door.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A pedestrian is spotted in the process of crossing the road in front of the vehicle, moving from the right to the left. This individual immediately escalates to a critical safety concern as the vehicle must give way and stay alert for any other pedestrians that might cross.\n\nOther Objects:\n- Additionally, there is a pile of trash situated on the right side of the road. While it doesn't currently impede traffic, its proximity to the roadway could lead to future blockages and requires attention.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down to ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing the road and be prepared to stop if necessary. Maintain a safe distance from trucks while monitoring their behavior and position concerning a yellow taxi that might change lanes suddenly. The vehicle should also avoid debris in the far right lane, which can be done by changing lanes or slowing down when approaching obstacles, and prepare to carefully navigate around parked trucks and a potentially slow-moving red car on the right side. Additionally, be vigilant of oncoming traffic, including taxis that may unexpectedly stop.",
