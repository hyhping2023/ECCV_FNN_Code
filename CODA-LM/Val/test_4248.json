        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a heavy truck directly in front of the ego vehicle, which is either stopped or moving slowly as indicated by its illuminated brake lights and visible rear safety barrier. This truck affects the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a slower speed and greater following distance. Due to the truck's large size, the driver's visibility is limited, making it challenging to see and react to the actions of other road users ahead.\n\nAdditionally, several vehicles are ahead of the heavy truck with their brake lights on, suggesting that there may be congestion or a traffic jam. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nA traffic light in the distance is showing a green signal, which under normal circumstances would mean that vehicles are allowed to proceed. However, the brake lights of the large truck indicate that traffic may not be moving despite the green light. The ego car must remain cautious and prepared to stop if the traffic situation does not resolve before the light changes.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, there is a barrier that separates the roadway from an area that is either under construction or has a drop-off. This barrier signifies that the ego car must stay in its current lane and be alert for any potential hazards or workers that might enter the road unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, the image is affected by a significant amount of glare, which could be due to oncoming vehicle headlights or street lights. This glare can distract or blind the driver, complicating safe navigation."

Since the brake lights of the truck are on, the ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down. The ego car should also remain alert for road debris and be prepared to avoid it if necessary. The presence of a green traffic light suggests that traffic may proceed, but the ego car should remain cautious and ready to stop due to the heavy vehicle and potential congestion ahead. To mitigate the effects of glare, the ego vehicle should ensure its windscreen is clean and use appropriate lighting settings if available. Remain in the current lane due to the barrier to the right and adjust speed if necessary to account for potentially slippery road conditions. Stay alert for any changes in the traffic situation."
