The presence of the silver van should be monitored as it could potentially change lanes or perform unexpected maneuvers, although it does not pose an immediate threat to the ego car's path at the moment.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian with dogs is in the process of crossing the street directly in front of the ego car, utilizing the crosswalk. This individual has the right of way and represents an immediate need for the autonomous vehicle to yield and wait until the crosswalk is completely clear before proceeding.\n\nMoreover, the traffic lights that govern the direction in which the ego vehicle is traveling are displaying a red signal. This necessitates the ego car to come to a full stop and remain stationary until the traffic lights turn green, allowing for safe passage. The absence of any road users in the categories of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects indicates that these elements are not present in the image and do not need to be considered for driving behavior at this time."

It should maintain an adequate stopping distance from the crosswalk to ensure safety for the vulnerable road user. The ego car should remain stationary until the traffic light turns green and it is safe to proceed. Additionally, even if the signal were to change to green, the ego car must ensure the pedestrian has finished crossing safely before proceeding. Monitoring the van's crossing maneuver, the ego car should also prepare to yield to any oncoming traffic that may have the right of way when the traffic signal changes. It is essential to wait for a clear and safe situation before proceeding through the intersection."
