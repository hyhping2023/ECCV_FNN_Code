Adjacent to the ego vehicle, in the right lane, is a light-colored car also moving in the same direction, which the ego car must maintain a safe distance from and monitor for potential lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, another dark-colored car is ahead in the same lane as the ego car, maintaining a straight path. The ego car is required to keep an eye on this vehicle's speed and distance to avoid getting too close. The road ahead is also occupied by various other vehicles in the same and adjacent lanes, moving at moderate speeds. These vehicles, varying in sizes, will impact the ego car's following distance and lane-changing decisions, requiring careful speed adjustments for safety.\n\nAbove the road, there is a directional sign that informs the ego car of the upcoming road layout, potentially necessitating a change in the vehicle's speed or lane position.\n\nOn the roadway surface of the right lane, red traffic cones have been knocked over, posing a potential road hazard or lane obstruction that the ego car needs to safely navigate around.\n\nThe right side of the roadway is bordered by a continuous metal barrier, which demarcates the drivable area, preventing the ego car from leaving the roadway and ensuring its path is confined to the designated road.\n\nVulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects are not present in this traffic scenario, thus they are not considered in the summarization of the observed scene."

It should also continue to monitor for any changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles. The ego car should remain alert to the possibility of merging or turning traffic indicated by the directional sign above."
