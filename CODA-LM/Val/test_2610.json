These vehicles span across the driving lane from left to right in the same lane as the ego car. The presence of these vehicles in the driving lane, with their brake lights on, suggests they might be encountering traffic or have come to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego car adjust its driving behavior, possibly requiring it to reduce speed or come to a complete stop in response to the traffic condition ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light situated on the right side of the road, ahead of the ego vehicle, which is currently green. The green traffic light signals that vehicles, including the ego car, have the right of way to continue moving along the path. This suggests that, although there is a potential need to slow down due to the vehicles ahead, the ego car is otherwise instructed to proceed if the flow of traffic permits. \n\nNo other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in this traffic scene."

A heightened state of alertness is advisable due to the reduced visibility and the possibility of sudden stops from the vehicles ahead. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to stop if the traffic ahead is stationary, and keep an eye out for any brake lights intensifying, which may indicate the traffic is coming to a halt. The headlights should be on if not already, to ensure visibility is maximized in the dark and wet conditions. Monitoring surrounding traffic for any unexpected pedestrian or vehicle movements is also advised."
