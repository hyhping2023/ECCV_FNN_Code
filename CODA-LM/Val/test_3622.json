        "description and explanation": "The traffic image shows several important elements affecting the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, there are red lights displayed across multiple signal heads above a toll booth. These red lights indicate that the ego vehicle must stop and wait for the green signal to proceed through the toll plaza. Additionally, there is an orange traffic cone placed on the road surface to the right of the toll booth. This cone warns of a potential hazard or change in the road layout, suggesting that the driver should proceed with caution and possibly avoid a specific lane or area. Furthermore, the entry lanes to the toll plaza are blocked by lowered red and white barrier arms, supplemented by reflective safety barriers, which serve as physical impediments to prevent vehicles from proceeding, indicating the need to halt until they are lifted. These elements collectively dictate that the vehicle should stop, exercise caution, and await clearance before moving forward."

In this context, the barrier is likely used to control vehicle entry and exit at a checkpoint or toll collection area.

Since the cone is positioned to the side of the driving path, it could be there to signal that drivers should stay clear of a certain area adjacent to the travel lane.",

It is used to regulate the flow of traffic by allowing or preventing vehicles from passing through. In this case, it appears to be in the lowered position, which indicates that vehicles are not permitted to pass. This will influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a stop and wait until the barrier is raised, which would signal permission to proceed.",

They are often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed for utility work. As a driver approaches a traffic cone, they should be mindful to steer away from it, ensuring they do not hit it. The cone serves as a signal to the driver to stay within the designated driving path and be aware of potential hazards or changes in normal traffic patterns.",
