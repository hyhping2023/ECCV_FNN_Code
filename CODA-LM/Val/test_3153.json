Vulnerable Road Users:\n   - A small dog located on the right side of the road between parked cars and the ego car's lane poses a risk due to its unpredictable movements, requiring readiness to stop or swerve.\n\n3. Traffic Cones:\n   - Traffic cones and construction signs on the left side warn of a construction zone ahead, advising the ego car to slow down and proceed cautiously.\n\n4. Barriers:\n   - A blue barrier fence along the left side of the road delineates the boundary of a construction area, highlighting the need for reduced speed and increased alertness due to possible presence of workers or machinery.\n\nThere are no traffic signs or other objects affecting the scene, and traffic lights are not active or visible in this image."
