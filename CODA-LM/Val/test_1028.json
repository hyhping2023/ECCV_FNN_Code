Since the traffic signal is green, the ego car can proceed with caution but should be prepared to change lanes if the large vehicle is moving slowly, ensuring that any lane changes are executed following standard traffic safety regulations and only if the adjacent lane is clear of traffic. Additionally, the ego car should watch for any indications that the truck is intending to turn or if it pulls over to the side of the road, while also checking for a safe opportunity to overtake the truck if it remains at a lower speed. It is essential to continuously monitor the traffic light to ensure it remains green, and be alert for any other signals from the truck that may affect the decision to overtake or continue following."
