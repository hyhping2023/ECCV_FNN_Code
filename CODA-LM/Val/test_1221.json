        "description and explanation": "The traffic image depicts two notable elements. Firstly, there are two traffic cones placed at the edge of the road on the right side, one upright and one fallen. These cones signal potential road obstacles or ongoing maintenance, which may impact the availability of lanes and necessitate the vehicle to safely adjust its lateral position. Secondly, green barriers are positioned on the sidewalk at a safe distance from the road. Although these barriers do not directly influence driving behavior, it is important for autonomous vehicles to remain vigilant for any unexpected pedestrian movements near these trash bins."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from motorcyclists and be ready to slow down or change lanes at any time to respond to the motorcyclist's speed or direction adjustments. Furthermore, due to the presence of traffic cones, the vehicle should also be prepared to slightly move to the left within the lane to avoid them, while still keeping a safe distance from the central dividing line of the road. Always monitor the surrounding environment to guard against unexpected movements or changes in the road conditions.",
