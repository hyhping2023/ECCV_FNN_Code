        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there's a notable presence of a stationary white car parked on the side of the road to the right, facing away from the ego car. This vehicle, while not posing an immediate threat, demands attention for potential movements or passengers exiting which could affect navigational decisions.\n\nAdditionally, overhead, there's a directional traffic sign which plays a crucial role in guiding the ego car by indicating available lanes for proceeding straight or making a right turn. This information is key for anticipating the road layout and making necessary lane adjustments in preparation for upcoming maneuvers.\n\nFurther complicating the traffic scenario are black-and-white traffic cones arranged in a line from the right curb into the lane, tapering into the road. These cones signal the likelihood of road work or obstacles ahead. They serve as a prompt for drivers to safely merge left and reduce speed to navigate past the potential hazards.\n\nAdjacent to the line of traffic cones, on the right-hand side of the road, there are several tarps or ground covers laid out. Their placement suggests they are covering areas of landscaping or construction. Although these objects are off the road, they indicate the presence of construction or maintenance work nearby. This scenario advises the ego car to proceed with caution, being mindful of the surroundings and prepared for unexpected developments.\n\nThe summary encapsulates the scene's components, highlighting how each element — stationary vehicles, traffic signs, and road work indicators — contributes to the driving environment. Thee are no mentions of vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers, indicating their absence in this specific traffic scenario."

It is often used to signal areas under construction, hazards on the road, or to demarcate traffic lanes. The presence of this traffic cone on the side of the road suggests that there might be some kind of work or hazard nearby.
