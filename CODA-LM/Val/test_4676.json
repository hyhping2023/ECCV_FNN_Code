        "description and explanation": "In the scene observed, there is a multifunctional utility vehicle that contains a crane-like lifting device. This vehicle is ahead in the same driving lane as our vehicle but slightly to the right. Caution is advised as this suggests possible construction or maintenance activities ahead; therefore, maintaining a safe distance is crucial, and preparedness to slow down or stop is necessary to react to any changes in the vehicle's operation.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, a group of pedestrians is noted to be moving in a direction parallel to the road. Their presence necessitates vigilant observation to account for the possibility of any of them entering the road unexpectedly, which could pose potential risks.\n\nAdditionally, various traffic signs are present, including a speed limit sign enforcing a maximum of 30 kilometers per hour and a no honking sign located on the right side. Compliance with the speed limit and honking restrictions is essential. Other signs mounted on a nearby pillar inform about no parking regulations and provide directional guidance to various destinations, which is instrumental for navigating turns and anticipating other vehicles reducing speed to adhere to these instructions.\n\nLastly, a median strip laden with shrubs is dividing the lanes of traffic moving in opposing directions. This barrier emphasizes the road structure by preventing left turns or U-turns, ensuring that vehicles stay on the designated side of the road, thus maintaining safe traffic flow.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are noted in the current environment, implying they have no impact on driving behavior in this situation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the engineering vehicle ahead to ensure adequate visibility and reaction time. Obey the speed limits indicated by road signs, and be alert for any changes in the speed or direction of the engineering vehicles so that you can adjust your driving behavior accordingly. Be aware of pedestrians on the right, and be prepared to comply with no-parking regulations, readying for a right turn or to follow the direction signs for navigation. Monitor the indicator lights of utility vehicles or any construction signs to get further clues about their intentions or the upcoming road conditions. Do not use your horn in this area, and stay vigilant for changes in traffic signs or unexpected obstacles on the road.",
