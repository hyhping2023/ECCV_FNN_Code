        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are specific details about vulnerable road users and barriers along with some noted other objects that influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, despite the absence of vehicles, traffic signs, traffic cones, and traffic lights in this scene.\n\nFirstly, the image captures two pedestrians. One is identified as possibly a male, walking away from the direction of the ego vehicle on the left side. He is dressed casually, carrying a bag, and using a sidewalk or pedestrian path that is separated from the road by a barrier, implying there is no immediate interaction expected with the ego vehicle. The other pedestrian is noticed wearing a light-colored jacket and dark pants, walking on the sidewalk with an umbrella, and moving in the same direction as the ego car on the right side of the road. This pedestrian's presence does not demand immediate action from the ego vehicle but warrants continuous observation to anticipate any potential roadway entry.\n\nA low barrier is mentioned as separating the pedestrian walkway from the road. This critical infrastructure delineates the space for vehicles and pedestrians, ensuring safe navigation. Although the barrier does not present a direct risk to the ego vehicle, it plays a crucial role in understanding road structure and marking pedestrian zones.\n\nFurthermore, the image details other objects that could influence driving behavior, albeit indirectly. There is mention of smudging or dirt on the camera lens or windshield, potentially obstructing image clarity. This reduced visibility could impair the autonomous system's ability to detect and respond accurately to road users and conditions. Additionally, a dustbin attached to a pole on the right side, near the second pedestrian, is noted. While off the roadway and not directly affecting driving behavior, the proximity to the pedestrian suggests the ego car should remain alert to any interaction between the pedestrian and the dustbin.\n\nIn summary, the traffic image highlights the importance of being aware of vulnerable road users, understanding the role of barriers in road demarcation, and recognizing the potential impact of visual obstructions and roadside objects on autonomous driving behavior."

Given the reduced visibility from smudging, the system should use additional sensors if available, like LIDAR or radar, to compensate. Continue monitoring pedestrian movements while respecting the barrier separation. Regular monitoring for changes in the pedestrian's direction or other potential road users entering the scene should continue. Proceed with caution, particularly due to the presence of the pedestrian. Maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop or slow down if the pedestrian changes course. Adjust speed accordingly to account for the wet road conditions."
