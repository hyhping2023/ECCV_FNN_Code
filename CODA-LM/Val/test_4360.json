        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are a couple of notable elements that call for attention and careful navigation:\n\n1. Vehicles: \n   - To the right and slightly ahead of the subject vehicle, there is an orange forklift. The forklift is facing the same direction as our vehicle. Given the nature of forklifts to engage in sudden maneuvers such as turns or abrupt stops, it is crucial to keep a watchful eye on it to anticipate and react to any unforeseen movements that might disrupt the flow of traffic.\n   - Further along the same lane, there are multiple cars that seem to be halted, with their brake lights illuminated. This situation indicates that there might be a traffic buildup or a red light up ahead, signaling the necessity for this car to be ready to decelerate or come to a complete stop, all while keeping a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any collisions.\n\n2. Other Objects:\n   - On the side of the road, there are trees and shrubs present. Although these natural elements do not pose an immediate threat to the vehicle, it is still essential to stay vigilant. Hidden pedestrians or animals could emerge from behind the foliage, unexpectedly entering the roadway and thus requiring quick reaction from the driver.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers have no relevant features listed, implicating that they do not need to be accounted for in this particular traffic setting."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance, monitor the forklift's indicator lights, and any signs of turning or stopping. Drive in the appropriate lane according to the anticipated direction of travel, obeying traffic signals. Stay alert and adjust speed or lane position as necessary based on the forklift's behavior and traffic lights. Considering road and traffic conditions, be prepared to slow down due to stationary traffic ahead and possible congestion. If changing lanes is safe and the left lane is not restricted by a red light, proceed with caution, taking into account wet road conditions, and remain vigilant for potential hazards on the roadside.",

The presence of a construction vehicle on or near the roadway may indicate nearby construction activities. Consequently, the ego car may need to proceed with caution, watch for potential obstacles or workers on the road, adhere to reduced speed limits, and be prepared for unexpected stoppages or diversions.",
