There is a white van in the distance on the right lane, which is traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Although it poses no immediate risk, its movements and speed should be monitored for safety. Additionally, there is a yellow-striped truck adjacent to the right side of the road, facing the ego car. This truck suggests there might be road work or maintenance underway, signaling the ego car to be cautious of merging or reducing traffic speed ahead.\n\nVulnerable road users include workers wearing high-visibility jackets on the right roadside, who seem to be engaged in construction or maintenance work. Their proximity to the road necessitates cautious driving from the ego car to allow for safe pedestrian movements.\n\nAn array of yellow and black striped warning signs located on the right edge indicates a work zone. These are critical for alerting the ego car to upcoming hazards, prompting reduced speed, and heightened carefulness.\n\nThe scene also includes yellow and black traffic cones, strategically aligned leading to the workers on the road's right side. These cones play a vital role in directing the flow of traffic away from the workers and marking areas that are momentarily closed to vehicles.\n\nThere is a temporary barrier set up alongside the traffic cones near the workers that delineates the work zone from the rest of the traffic lanes. This barrier serves to ensure the ego car stays at a safe distance from the work zone.\n\nFinally, there are other objects present in the scene, such as roadwork materials and tools in close proximity to the workers. While these objects are not currently obstructive, there is a possibility they could become a hazard if they were to shift onto the driving path; hence, the ego car should drive vigilantly."
