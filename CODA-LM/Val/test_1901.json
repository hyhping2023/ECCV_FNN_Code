It is positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, taking up most of the lane. Due to the truck's size and location, it is important for the ego car to keep a safe distance behind it. This is necessary because there is a risk of sudden stops by the truck, and the potential for debris to fall from the truck's open container, which could be hazardous to the ego vehicle. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

In this scenario, the presence of the bollard indicates that the ego car should remain in the lane, away from the roadside or any adjacent non-driving areas, possibly indicating a boundary for lanes, thereby impacting the driver's behavior to stay within the designated traffic lane.",
