It features an extended crane arm, reflective warning signage, and lights, denoting it as a possible service or construction vehicle. Due to its size and position, the truck represents an immediate obstacle, necessitating the ego car to potentially slow down or prepare to change lanes for safe progression, as the truck may make unexpected stops or movements.\n\nTwo groups of pedestrians are present, one on the left sidewalk and another on the right, both at a safe distance from the roadway. Although they are not directly affecting the driving behavior of the ego car at this moment, their movements should be monitored. Specifically, the pedestrians on the left necessitate caution from the ego car in case they decide to enter the street or cross the road. The other objects, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers categories contain no described road users and thus do not impact the driving scenario in this image."

Continually monitor the behavior of the pedestrians on the sidewalk in the event they enter the roadway and adjust driving behavior accordingly. Remain observant for any upcoming traffic signs, lights, or changes in road conditions that are not currently visible. The ego car should reduce its speed and prepare to stop if necessary. The driver should check the adjacent lanes for traffic and switch lanes if it is safe and legal to do so in order to bypass the utility truck. The driver should also be aware of any signals from the truck's operator, as the truck may be stationary due to ongoing work or preparing to move. If bypassing is not possible, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and wait for the utility truck to move or for instructions from a traffic control authority if one is present at the scene. Also, drive at reduced speed to account for wet road conditions and the increased potential for hydroplaning. The driver should be vigilant for any pedestrians that may enter the roadway unexpectedly, despite them currently being off the road."
