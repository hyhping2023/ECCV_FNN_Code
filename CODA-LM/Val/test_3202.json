This indicates the presence of slow-moving traffic or congestion, signaling the need to drive cautiously as the traffic ahead may unexpectedly stop or slow down. Additionally, a reflective traffic cone is spotted on the right, likely indicating a construction or work area. This requires vehicles to maintain to the left, ensuring they avoid the coned-off area while also driving carefully due to the potential presence of narrow lanes or nearby workers."

Drive to the left of the traffic cones and be aware of wet and slippery road conditions, exercising caution to ensure safety. Due to low visibility, it is recommended to use headlights, and fog lights may also be necessary to improve visibility. Self-driving vehicles should reduce speed as much as possible, use lights appropriately, remain highly alert to unpredictable road users or obstacles, and be prepared to adjust driving behavior as the situation evolves and more information becomes available.",
