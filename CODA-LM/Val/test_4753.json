A red car on the lane to the front left that is partially obstructing the passage. The position of this vehicle may indicate that it has been parked or temporarily stopped, reducing the available width of the lane and requiring careful driving.\n2. A row of vehicles parked on the right side of the street. These parked vehicles necessitate that the car remains in the left lane to avoid any car doors accidentally opening or pedestrians suddenly emerging from between vehicles.\n3. A silver van in the left part of the image, located in the adjacent lane in front of this vehicle. As this vehicle is in the adjacent lane and ahead, it may change lanes or slow down, which could affect the driving behavior of our vehicle.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users:\n1. A few pedestrians beside the car parked on the right side of the road. Pedestrians may suddenly enter the road near the driving path, so caution and readiness to stop are advised.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier is present:\n1. A blue guardrail runs along the vehicles parked on the right side. This guardrail provides a physical boundary that should not be crossed and marks the edge of the navigable road space.\n\nLastly, other objects include:\n1. Various items densely arranged beside the parked cars on the right side of the road. These objects may restrict the available road width and could potentially move onto the roadway, necessitating cautious driving.\n"
