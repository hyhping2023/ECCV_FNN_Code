        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a cement mixer truck on the left side, at approximately a 45-degree angle to our vehicle, moving in the opposite direction. This truck is a potential hazard due to its large size and proximity, which could lead to unexpected maneuvers or debris falling off that may affect our driving path and safety.\n\nAdditionally, a black SUV is observed on the far left, also driving in the opposite direction of the traffic flow. Although it is separated by a central divider, it is important to monitor this vehicle for any sudden turns or encroachments into oncoming traffic, which would require our vehicle to slow down to maintain a safe distance.\n\nOther vehicles are present on the opposite lane, moving in the opposite direction. While they are not immediate concerns, their movements should be watched for any unexpected lane changes.\n\nA pedestrian is seen crossing the street on the crosswalk to the left, moving diagonally towards our side of the street. This pedestrian could present a risk if they deviate from the crosswalk or if the traffic light changes, necessitating that our autonomous vehicle waits for them to pass safely before proceeding.\n\nAbove the traffic light in the upper left corner, there is a traffic sign indicating a speed limit of 50 km/h. This sign informs the maximum legal speed for the lane and, along with other signs, dictates the speed and regulations our vehicle should follow.\n\nThe traffic light itself, located in the top left corner, is red, signaling that vehicles should stop and wait at the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the presence of pedestrians and the obscured view of traffic lights, self-driving cars should proceed with caution. If the traffic light is green, the vehicle should gradually accelerate while monitoring pedestrians on the left sidewalk to predict potential hazards. If the light is not green or the signal is unclear, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop, while assessing the intentions of pedestrians crossing the street. It is crucial to be aware of surrounding vehicles, especially cement mixers, to prevent them from suddenly changing lanes or stopping. After safely passing the intersection, a speed limit of 50 kilometers per hour should be observed. Currently, self-driving cars should remain stationary, allowing pedestrians to cross the street, and wait for the concrete mixer if it decides to turn. It should also wait until the black SUV completes its left turn and the traffic light turns green before proceeding. Speed should be adjusted according to visible speed limit signs, and remain vigilant for any sudden movements from vehicles in the direction of oncoming traffic.",
