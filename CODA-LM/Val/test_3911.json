A white car is on the left side of the image, traveling in the opposite direction on the oncoming lane. It is crucial to ensure that this vehicle remains in its own lane while monitoring the actions of oncoming traffic.\n  2. Several cars are parked on the right side of the road, mixed with the vehicles in motion. These parked vehicles may obstruct the view of the road, and there is a risk that car doors could suddenly open.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A cyclist is riding along the center of the lane ahead, traveling in the same direction as our car. It is necessary to maintain a safe following distance behind the cyclist and be prepared to overtake safely when possible since both the cyclist and the vehicle follow the same trajectory.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - On the right side of the road, there is a speed limit sign marked \"30\" and a \"No Parking\" sign. Respecting these traffic signs is essential: the speed limit sign instructs the vehicle to maintain a speed of 30 kilometers per hour or lower, while the \"No Parking\" sign indicates that the white vehicle parked there is violating regulations, alerting the self-driving vehicle to potential unexpected movements of parked vehicles.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - A trash can is located on the right side of the road, next to the parked cars. It is important to note such fixed objects by the roadside to maintain spatial awareness, although this trash can currently does not affect the driving route."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current road conditions and users, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the bicycles ahead. It should prepare to overtake, ensuring safety and legality, and carefully pass stationary and moving objects on the left. Monitor the white vehicles coming toward you to stay in the correct lane, and adjust your speed to not exceed the speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour. Be vigilant of the behavior changes of passengers in parked vehicles or individuals on moving scooters. Maintain a cautious speed to comply with speed limits and be prepared to slow down for bicycles in the lane. Unless it is safe to do so and there is enough space, this vehicle should not attempt to overtake. Be alert to pedestrians that may enter the road or the possibility of the blue vehicle ahead changing lanes. Monitor parked vehicles to prevent being surprised by opening car doors or pedestrians stepping out between vehicles. Considering the traffic conditions, this vehicle should maintain a moderate speed that complies with the 30 kilometers per hour speed limit. Be careful when overtaking blue vehicles and electric scooters, ensuring to give vulnerable road users enough space. Continue to monitor parked vehicles to anticipate opening doors or the appearance of pedestrians. Overall, staying alert and ready to respond to the dynamic environment is key.",
