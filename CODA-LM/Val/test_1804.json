        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and objects that the autonomous driving system has acknowledged. Firstly, there is a large green and white concrete mixer truck directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the center of the lane. The presence of this truck is significant because it is large enough to obstruct visibility and there's a risk associated with it if it stops suddenly or changes lanes. Furthermore, an orange car is driving in the leftmost lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. The behavior of this orange car warrants close attention, particularly as it may change lanes or alter its speed.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones have been reported in the scene. However, there are metal fence barriers on the right side of the road, serving to separate the sidewalk from the road. These barriers are beneficial as they deter pedestrians from entering the road, meaning the ego car does not have to prepare for pedestrians stepping into the driving path in this area.\n\nAdditionally, there are trees and street light poles on both sides of the road. While these stationary objects don't pose a direct impact on the driving route of the ego vehicle, it's important to keep them accounted for to maintain a safe distance. The scene also includes pedestrians and what appears to be a vendor on the sidewalk to the right side of the road. Despite the fact they're not on the roadway, the autonomous system must remain vigilant to the possibility of pedestrians or the vendor entering the street unexpectedly."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the mixer truck, as it may have limited visibility and may make unpredictable movements. Continuous monitoring of all mirrors is recommended to keep aware of the surroundings. Since the road conditions are clear, proceed with normal caution. Additionally, the orange car is a dynamic element to keep in mind, despite it being in the opposite lane. No immediate action required for the stationary objects and barriers; continue monitoring routinely. Keep an eye on the orange car in the adjacent lane and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, ensuring to check blind spots and use indicators before any lane change. Continue to monitor the side of the road for any pedestrians that might enter the roadway and be prepared to react appropriately. As always, adhere to traffic laws and drive defensively."
