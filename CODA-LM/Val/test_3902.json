        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a silver SUV directly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, maintaining both its lane and distance. This vehicle's position immediately in front is critical as it dictates the speed at which the ego car travels and the distance it needs to maintain to ensure safe following.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users present, including a black dog crossing the road from left to right, approximately midway across the lane of the ego vehicle. This animal's presence on the road poses a potential hazard, potentially necessitating an emergency stop to avoid a collision. Alongside, a cyclist is noted on the right-hand side of the road, riding in the same direction as the ego car. The close proximity of the cyclist to the roadway introduces a risk should the cyclist unexpectedly veer into the travel lane, requiring the ego vehicle to possibly adjust its path or speed to ensure safety.\n\nIn this traffic situation, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects needing consideration, allowing focus to remain solely on the vehicles and vulnerable road users present."

Furthermore, keep a wider than usual buffer zone around the cyclist and be prepared to halt the vehicle safely."
