There is a white car in the left lane directly ahead, suggesting the need to maintain proper following distance and speed adjustment. A red SUV is nearby in the right lane, potentially requiring the ego car to respond to any sudden lane changes or changes in speed. Further along the right lane, there is a truck with construction equipment signaling potential road work activities that could disrupt normal traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this scene. However, there is a road work sign on the right barrier, indicating that the ego car might need to be alert for reduced speed zones or lane shifts due to construction.\n\nConcrete barriers on both sides of the road create a narrowed environment without shoulders, calling for the ego car to stay centered in the lane to avoid collisions. Finally, there is visible construction equipment above the barriers on the left side, implying that the ego car should be cautious of potential hazards or personnel entering the roadway."
