Despite the absence of traffic lights in this image, the ego car must be attentive to other traffic controls, such as the aforementioned traffic signs.\n\nOrange traffic cones are present, directing traffic to veer left, signaling that there might be road works or obstructions ahead, and that the ego car must follow the detour path. Likewise, there are temporary barriers placed on the right side of the road, guiding traffic away from a section, presumably due to construction work or a road closure.\n\nLastly, there are no other objects such as debris or dustbins in the image, meaning there are no additional hazards the ego car needs to navigate around."
