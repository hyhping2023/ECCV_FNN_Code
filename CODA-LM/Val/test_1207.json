It is partially on the road and partially on a dedicated lane for work vehicles. Although it is stationary, it may move and potentially obstruct the ego car's path if it enters the road or suddenly moves, which can affect the driving path of the ego car.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there is a traffic light showing a red signal, indicating that the ego car must stop and wait until the signal changes to green before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary green and blue construction barriers on the left side, partially surrounding the forklift and separating the work zone from the traffic. These barriers suggest that there may be construction or road work ahead, possibly narrowing the drivable roadway for the ego car, which may require it to slow down and follow any detour indications present."

In the context of driving behavior, the presence of this vehicle suggests nearby construction activity.

While stopping, the driver should monitor the forklift and the construction area for any changes that could affect the future path of travel. There are no immediate actions required other than waiting for the traffic light to turn green. The ego car should also be prepared to navigate around any obstacles created by the construction when the traffic light changes, and watch for any signals or movement from the forklift operator. Additionally, caution should be taken due to the forklift and the barriers indicating construction, which may reduce the road width or require additional attention for any sudden movements of construction vehicles or workers. The ego car should be prepared to follow any temporary traffic signs or ground markings that instruct how to navigate the construction area. While waiting, maintain a safe distance from the forklift to the left to avoid any potential hazards if it begins to move or turn. Stay alert for any changes in the traffic light and be prepared to proceed when it turns green, ensuring that the way is clear and the forklift does not interfere with the driving path."
