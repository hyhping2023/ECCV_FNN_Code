Specifically, there is one individual on the right side of the road, dressed in a dark blue jacket and casual pants. This pedestrian is near the driving path of the ego car, presenting a potential safety concern for both the pedestrian and the driver.\n\nAdditionally, there is a parking sign on the left, showing blue with white text and a red symbol, situated at a parking booth. While this sign gives instructions for parking, it does not directly affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle unless it's looking to park. It does, however, indicate an area where cars might be entering or exiting parking spots, which requires attention from passing drivers.\n\nThe road situation is further complicated by the presence of multiple traffic cones and a barrier arranged diagonally across the right-hand lane, signaling a lane closure or restriction. These require the ego car to alter its course or reduce speed for safe maneuvering around the blocked area. Complementing these cones, a white and red striped barrier stretches across part of the lane, ensuring drivers are cognizant of the need to avoid this path and make necessary adjustments."
