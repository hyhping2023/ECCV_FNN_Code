The truck seems to be stationary or moving very slowly, which could obstruct the path or cause reduced visibility for the ego car, necessitating careful maneuvering. Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road, parallel to the curb, with their tail lights on, indicating they are not moving. These parked cars could potentially obstruct traffic flow if a door is opened or a car pulls out unexpectedly. There is also a sedan to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead, which appears to be parked or moving very slowly in an adjacent lane. This vehicle limits the ego car's ability to change lanes to avoid obstacles.\n\nReflective traffic cones are placed between the parked cars and the moving traffic on the right, suggesting roadwork or a hazard ahead. These cones are narrowing the drivable roadway and may require the ego car to merge left or slow down. A metal fence is present on the right side of the road, bordering the sidewalk and the parked cars, which marks the boundary of the driving area and emphasizes the lack of a shoulder to pull over on, increasing the need for caution.\n\nLastly, a blue dustbin is located at the edge of the road on the right side, near the parked cars. While it does not pose an immediate threat, it indicates the presence of potential roadside activities or obstructions that the ego car should be aware of while passing. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights present in the image."
