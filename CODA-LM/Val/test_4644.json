This vehicle's location and activity are likely to reduce the drivable road area and create potential debris, requiring the ego vehicle to exercise caution. It may need to change lanes or adjust speed to accommodate these conditions. Additionally, there is a red traffic light visible ahead, which is mounted on the back of the construction vehicle. The red light is an instruction for the ego vehicle to stop, or at least to prepare to stop, as it indicates that forward motion must cease. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects identified in the current traffic image that affect the ego vehicle's driving behavior."

It appears to be involved in some nighttime roadwork or construction activity. The presence of this vehicle in the driving scenario indicates that there might be roadworks or construction ahead. Consequently, the ego vehicle should reduce speed and proceed with caution, being prepared to stop or maneuver around the construction area if necessary. Furthermore, the vehicle should also be aware of any temporary traffic signs or signals that may be in place due to the construction works.",
