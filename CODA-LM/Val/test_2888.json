        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are no vehicles; hence, they do not factor into the current driving scenario. However, there are vulnerable road users present: a pedestrian donning a reflective vest is standing by the sidewalk and represents a potential dynamic obstacle that may cause our vehicle to yield should he decide to cross the road. Additionally, a cyclist is distant but visible through the pedestrian overpass at the road's far end, potentially impacting the flow of traffic if they decide to enter the road.\n\nFor traffic signs, there is a sign on the right highlighting the entrance and exit lanes with both arrows and text, which is a navigation cue that must be followed by the vehicle to appropriately pass through this area.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights in the image, there are numerous traffic cones in the foreground and the middle that denote a division between the road and construction area, suggesting that the autonomous vehicle must maneuver around the work zone that could imply road closures or restricted access.\n\nLastly, other objects such as maintenance tools, including a broom and dustpan, sit off the road to the right side of a building. While they currently do not interfere with the vehicle's trajectory, there's a minor risk they could affect the path of the self-driving vehicle should they unexpectedly be displaced onto the road. There are no barriers in the traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "When driving a car, one should proceed with caution, maintaining low speed due to pedestrians and wet, slippery road surfaces. Be prepared at all times to yield to pedestrians who may cross the street and follow the direction of lanes as indicated by traffic signs. Vehicles should also be mindful of construction areas marked by traffic cones, detour around them, and be aware of any workers that may be present. Drive carefully to ensure yielding to pedestrians using crosswalks. As traffic cones and obstacles may indicate road construction, be ready to change routes or reduce speed. If you plan to follow the direction indicated by information signs, prepare to turn left when it is safe, and ensure to signal any changes in lanes or directions to other road users well in advance. Especially near zebra crossings, drive cautiously around workers and any surrounding pedestrians. Stay vigilant for vehicles that may be slowing down to enter parking areas. Respect the boundaries delineated by traffic cones, adjust your lane position when necessary, and maintain a safe distance from cyclists.",
