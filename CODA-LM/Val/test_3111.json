        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are a few notable elements affecting the autonomous car's journey. The first is a silver sedan situated directly ahead in the right lane. It is crucial for our car to monitor its speed and maintain a safe following distance since the actions of this leading car will influence our driving decisions, especially in terms of adjusting speed or stopping.\n\nAdditionally, there is a black and white SUV parked on the left side of the road, partially on the sidewalk and beneath a red tent structure. The SUV's position, albeit not on the self-driving vehicle's direct path, may impact visibility for the car and also affect the behavior of other road users, including pedestrians who might step into the street from behind the parked SUV.\n\nA single traffic cone is placed beside the left sidewalk. The cone could be signifying road work or an obstacle by the roadside, necessitating a cautious speed and increased distance to avoid any unexpected hazards.\n\nA hedge running along the right side of the road acts as a natural barrier between the road and sidewalk. It is well-maintained and provides a clear boundary for the road, which aids in preventing pedestrians from inadvertently entering the roadway and thus lowers the risk for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this image that the self-driving car needs to be aware of. The given information indicates a relatively clear path, but attention must be given to the parked vehicles and traffic cone that could signal potential changes in road conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the silver sedan ahead. Pay attention to observe if the vehicle in front makes any sudden movements, as traffic cones may indicate the presence of obstacles or activities. Continue to monitor any other signs, signals, or changes in traffic on the road, all of which could affect your driving behavior. Be alert for the appearance of pedestrians near the black SUV on your left. If the vehicle ahead does not move, consider changing lanes when it is safe and legal to do so.",
