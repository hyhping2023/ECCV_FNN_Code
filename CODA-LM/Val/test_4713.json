This indicates potential traffic congestion ahead or a traffic signal requiring a stop. Additionally, a white station wagon decorated with decals is parked in the rightmost lane, partially obstructing it, which may necessitate other vehicles to merge into the adjacent lane, affecting traffic flow.

Monitor surrounding vehicles, especially those overtaking on the left, and be ready to respond to their movements. Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed appropriately to maintain a safe margin. Stay alert for any traffic signals that are not visible in the image, and proceed with caution as the traffic flow or signals change. Keep a safe following distance behind the black SUV as it completes the turn, prepare to slow down since traffic in the left lane appears to have stopped or is moving slowly. With a camper present in the right lane, be prepared to adjust lane position if necessary, and be aware of a potential queue forming in the left lane due to a traffic light ahead. Because of the wet roads, maintain a moderate speed and increase the following distance, prepare to merge left to avoid the parked camper, while also watching for other vehicles that may be navigating around the obstacle. Stay vigilant for any traffic signs or signals that come into view.",
