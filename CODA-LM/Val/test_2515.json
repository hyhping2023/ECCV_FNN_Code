The ego car should monitor the bus's signals and maintain lateral distance whenever possible."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are two significant vehicles affecting the driving environment of the ego vehicle. There's a heavy truck situated directly in front of the ego car, distinguished by its activated brake lights and hazard lights, and its load bears resemblance to either a piece of machinery or a concrete mixer. The truck's license plate is partially visible as '浙DT2925'. The size of the truck and its illuminated lights indicate that it might be either moving slowly or completely stopped. This condition requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to stop or maneuver around the truck if the situation calls for it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue bus in the left lane adjacent to the ego car; it is ahead of the ego vehicle and exhibits its rear and brake lights, having the registration '浙DA6065'. Its position suggests a possible stop-and-go traffic scenario. It also demands the ego car to stay vigilant for unpredictable movements from pedestrians or the potential of the bus merging into the ego car's lane. It's important for the ego car to observe the bus's signals and preserve a safe lateral distance when feasible.\n\nConcerning traffic control devices, there is a red traffic light in the view that commands vehicles to halt at the intersection. The red light requires the ego car to anticipate stopping behind the heavy truck or any other vehicle present at the light. The ego car is to remain at a standstill until the light turns green, signifying that it's secure and lawful to continue. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data that impact the driving behavior of the ego car in this particular scene."

Additionally, stay alert for any changes in the behavior of the bus in the adjacent lane and be ready for possible merging traffic. Wait for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding. The ego car should reduce speed to allow for a safe stopping distance behind the truck, especially given the wet road conditions. It must prepare to stop at the red traffic light and observe the bus's behavior to respond to any lane changes or stops. Overall, the ego car should proceed with caution, especially since visibility may be reduced due to the lighting conditions and potential reflection from the wet road surface."
