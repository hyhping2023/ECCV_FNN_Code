The truck could potentially make sudden stops or turns, impacting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

This heavy and slow-moving truck, potentially en route to or from a construction site and equipped with a rotating drum, may impact the ego car's driving behavior. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow-downs, as the truck might make sudden stops or turns.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: There is a traffic light visible ahead, mounted on a metal post on the right side of the road. It has three signal aspects, but the current state (red, yellow, or green) cannot be determined from the image. The status of this traffic light is crucial as it will dictate whether the ego car should prepare to stop, continue at the current speed, or proceed with caution.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image."

Its presence on the road is indicative of nearby construction activity. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from this vehicle, as these types of vehicles often make frequent stops and can have unpredictable movement patterns when actively servicing construction sites.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the heavy vehicle ahead, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance that allows for enough time to react if the concrete mixer truck slows down or stops abruptly. Speed adjustments may be necessary based on the actions of the truck. Additionally, the ego car should keep an eye on the traffic light and be prepared to stop or proceed based on its indication. If the traffic light turns green and if there is a need to overtake the truck, the ego car should ensure it is safe and legal to change lanes to the left. If not, the ego car should patiently follow the truck while observing the road for any changes. Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck, preparing to slow down or stop if the truck exhibits any unpredictable maneuvers. Keep an eye out for any indicators from the truck, such as brake lights or turn signals, to anticipate its actions. Check the lanes to the left for a safe opportunity to overtake the truck if it slows down significantly and it is safe and legal to do so."
