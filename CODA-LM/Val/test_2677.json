The pedestrian is currently not crossing but should be watched carefully for any sudden movements, especially given the reduced visibility at night. \n\nA traffic sign indicating a right-turn-only is installed near the pedestrian kiosk, and the ego car must be ready to adjust lanes if planning to turn. Above the road, there is a red banner with white text that is not legible, which could contain important warnings or directions. The intersection is controlled by multiple red traffic lights, signaling that all traffic must stop.\n\nTo the left of the ego vehicle, white and green barriers partially obscure a construction site or closed area, indicating that there may be lane narrowing or roadworks ahead, which necessitates increased vigilance for any changes in road conditions. Additionally, there is a brightly lit kiosk on the right, which could potentially distract drivers or affect visibility with its glare, so it is important for the ego car to stay focused on the road. Traffic cones and other categories are not present in this scene."
