This requires that the ego car exercises caution and is prepared to adjust its speed or change lanes if the bus begins to move. Additionally, though the street is well-lit, the traffic light itself cannot be distinguished in the image, which means that the ego car must rely on standard road rules and proceed with care, especially at intersections or junctions. Alongside the right sidewalk, there's a fence that serves as a boundary indicating private property. However, this barrier does not affect the driving behavior but simply marks the edge of the drivable area on that side of the road. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

Since the traffic light is not visible in the image, the ego car should follow standard traffic rules and be prepared to yield or stop at intersections."
