        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, directly in front of my vehicle is a large truck occupying the same lane, with its bright brake lights on, indicating that it is slowing down or about to stop. This requires maintaining a safe following distance and being ready to stop or slow down. To the right, a white car has also activated its brake lights and is angled slightly forward, suggesting it is stopping ahead, possibly due to traffic congestion or forming a queue. This oblique position might indicate a lane change or a reaction to an event ahead, requiring attentiveness for anticipatory driving. Additionally, there are several cars in the lanes adjacent to my vehicle on both sides, with one car slightly ahead in the right lane. Their presence affects lane-changing abilities and responses to the truck ahead.\n\nA green traffic light is located above the intersection, indicating vehicles ahead can proceed, but the stillness or slow movement of vehicles suggests potential traffic congestion or unseen obstacles.\n\nOn the left side of my vehicle are one or a series of obstacles, likely markers for a construction area or delineating the edge of the road. This presence suggests construction or other road conditions that require extra caution and potentially slowing down."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the large truck ahead is braking and there's a red light ahead, this vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop while maintaining a safe distance from the truck. In addition, the driver should remain vigilant for possible lane changes from vehicles in adjacent lanes due to traffic congestion. Due to wet roads, extra caution should be exercised and the following distance should be increased to account for longer stopping distances. This vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the truck and be ready to stop or adjust speed if necessary, while being alert to changes in surrounding traffic, especially since the white car next to us may change lanes suddenly. If traffic remains slow despite a green light, this vehicle should remain patient and be alert to any changes in traffic signals or the status of traffic lights. Unless it is clear that the truck will be stopped for a long time, this vehicle should not attempt to change lanes, taking into account the position and movement of nearby vehicles. The vehicle should follow the flow of traffic and adhere to green light signals unless the actions of the truck or other vehicles require a complete stop or a change of action.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a vertical metal post with a reflective surface commonly known as a bollard. Bollards are typically used to control or direct road traffic, such as guiding cars within a certain path, blocking vehicle access to pedestrian areas, or providing protection to sidewalks and buildings from vehicle collisions. In this scenario, the bollard indicates the edge of the driving lane and helps to prevent vehicles from moving into the restricted area to the left. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this bollard to avoid any potential collision.",

Its purpose is to control access to an area, restricting passage until vehicles are permitted to proceed. Since it spans across what might be a driving lane or partition, it will influence the ego car's behavior by requiring the driver to stop and wait for the barrier to be raised or removed before continuing. It acts as a signal to the ego car that it must halt and possibly prepare to present credentials or make a payment if it's a toll booth scenario.",
