On the left side of the road, there is a red truck facing the opposite direction of the ego car, which is partially obstructing the adjacent lane. This may suggest the presence of roadwork or some obstruction on the other lane, potentially affecting the traffic flow and leading to vehicles merging into the ego car's lane. Ahead of the ego car, there's a flatbed truck carrying pipes and construction materials, which appears to be stationary or moving slowly. It is indicative of potential roadwork ahead, meaning the ego car may need to reduce speed or even stop if the truck starts unloading or is impacted by road conditions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in this image.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a yellow triangular warning sign with a black exclamation point suggests caution due to potential hazards that could be encountered ahead, like roadwork, obstructions, or changes in traffic patterns.\n\nThe image shows multiple orange traffic cones scattered around the flatbed truck and in the path of the ego car, signaling lane narrowing or closure and possibly delineating a construction zone. This would require the ego car to change lanes or prepare to stop.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or barriers present in this image.\n\nAdditionally, there are other objects that include a directional road sign indicating a right turn ahead. The ego car should take note of this if its intended path includes turning right. Lastly, there is an industrial-sized dustbin located on the left side of the road, behind the red truck. Although not directly affecting the ego carâ€™s trajectory, it contributes to the general scene assessment."
