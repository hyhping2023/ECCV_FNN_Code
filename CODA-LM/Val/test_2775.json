This vehicle is partially obstructing the path, diminishing the available road space for the main vehicle. The presence of this construction vehicle calls for cautious driving; the main vehicle must either change lanes or reduce speed to bypass the obstruction safely. A careful approach is also warranted as the construction vehicleâ€™s large size and potential to make unpredictable movements create a risk.\n\nAdditionally, there is some medium-dense vegetation and high-voltage power lines flanking both sides of the road. While these elements aren't immediately affecting the driving behavior, there is a possibility that unseen factors such as overhanging branches or downed power lines could present hazards that are not captured in the current image."

Stay alert for any sudden movements by construction vehicles, and only overtake when it is certain that there is no oncoming traffic and it is safe to do so. Drive carefully due to the lack of lane markings, and be vigilant of oncoming vehicles.",

Due to the size and nature of the vehicle, the ego car will have to maintain a safe distance and may need to reduce speed or wait if the construction vehicle is entering or crossing the road. The presence of this vehicle also suggests potential construction activity ahead, which may lead to traffic delays or detours. The driver of the ego car should be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speed limits.",
