        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, two vehicles are observed:\n\n1. A large truck is positioned on the right side, occupying its own adjacent lane. It appears to be either stationary or moving very slowly, and a portion of the truck's body slightly extends into the lane of the ego vehicle. The presence of the truck may restrict the ego car's ability to maneuver and could pose a risk should the truck begin to move into the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n2. There are also oncoming vehicles in the opposite lane that have their headlights activated, suggesting it is nighttime. The headlights from these oncoming vehicles could potentially cause glare, which may impair the visibility for the driver of the ego car.\n\nThe other categories like vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not have any listings and hence are not present in the image."

This vehicle tends to move slower than typical traffic and may make wide or sudden turns due to its function. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for potential stops or reduced speed of the construction vehicle, and exercise caution when overtaking, accounting for the construction vehicle's extended dimensions and potential for unexpected maneuvers.",

Slow down due to wet road conditions to prevent hydroplaning. Use low-beam headlights to reduce glare for oncoming drivers and enhance visibility. Continually scan the environment for any changes, especially movements from the large truck."
