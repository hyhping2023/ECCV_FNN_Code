        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several key elements that impact driving decisions and behaviors. \n\nFirstly, there is a white sedan parked on the left side of the street. This vehicle is partially obstructing the road, posing a potential risk as it may suddenly re-enter the traffic flow. Such an action could directly affect the trajectory of the ego car, requiring it to possibly change lanes or adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is noted on the right side, walking towards the intersection. The presence of this individual in close proximity to the road indicates a need for heightened alertness from the ego car. The pedestrian could decide to cross the street unexpectedly, necessitating that the ego vehicle be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision. \n\nFinally, there are visible piles of construction material on the left side of the road. These materials signal potential road work ahead and result in a narrowing of the drivable space. The presence of these barriers necessitates a slower driving speed and an increased level of caution as the vehicle passes by to ensure the safe navigation of the affected area.\n\nIn summary, the traffic scene is characterized by a mix of stationary obstacles and dynamic road users that together require careful navigation. The parked white sedan, pedestrian near the intersection, and construction materials alongside the road, each dictate a specific adjustment in driving behavior to maintain safety and adhere to traffic laws."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is typically used to direct traffic. It is usually made of a bright color like orange, with reflective striping for visibility. In this scenario, a traffic cone is placed on the side of the road, likely indicating that there are roadworks or obstacles ahead. The ego car must remain alert and possibly prepare to slow down or change lanes if the road ahead is obstructed or if workers are present.",

It acts as a warning for drivers to avoid certain areas on the road, redirect their path, or pay attention to temporary road changes or potential hazards. The presence of the traffic cone in the scenario indicates that the driver of the ego car may need to adjust the vehicle's course to maintain a safe driving path and avoid the marked area.
