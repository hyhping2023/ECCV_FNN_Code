Additionally, there are no visible traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones. There is, however, a long wall and a set of large industrial cable spools located at the side of the road. These barriers create a physical boundary and warrant caution due to their proximity to the road, even though they are unlikely to move. In a separate area, there are additional large cable spools situated within a storage space behind a low fence. Since these are off the roadway and stationary, they pose no immediate threat to traffic and do not affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
