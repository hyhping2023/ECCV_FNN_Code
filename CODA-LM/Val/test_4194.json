It is partially in the same lane as the ego car and has its headlights on. The bus, being a large vehicle, could potentially obstruct the ego car's path. This may require the ego car to navigate around the bus or slow down to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a truck parked parallel to the road on the right side with no visible activity. Although the truck does not directly influence the immediate driving behavior of the ego car, it is important to be aware of it since it could become an active road user if it starts to move. \n\nFurthermore, the image contains yellow and black temporary road barriers on the right side, which divide the driving space from the shoulder of the road. These barriers restrict the ego vehicle from moving too far to the right and clearly delineate the driving path that must be followed."

Given its size and the type of road that it appears to be operating on, the bus may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a reduction in speed and an increase in following distance to accommodate safe stopping distances and reaction times. Additionally, depending on the bus's actions, the ego car may need to be prepared for the bus to make stops to pick up or drop off passengers, which could require the ego car to halt or pass when safe.",

The presence of this bus indicates that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and speed, being prepared to adjust its course if the bus were to make any sudden movements or stops.

Keep headlights and possibly high beams on if traffic conditions allow, to ensure maximum visibility. Be prepared to stop or yield to the bus if it starts to move or indicate any intention of rejoining the traffic. Monitor the truck on the right side for any activity. Adhere to lane markings and maintain a safe distance from the barriers on the right side. Proceed with caution due to the low-visibility nighttime driving conditions."
