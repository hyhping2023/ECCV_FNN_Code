Ahead in the same lane, there is a white car that appears to be either stationary or moving slowly, necessitating the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be vigilant for any sudden stops or changes in speed. On the right side of the road, there are bicyclists occupying a section, potentially a designated bike lane, which requires the ego car to be cautious and consider lateral maneuvers to ensure safety. Additionally, a group of cyclists is present on the right side of the road, occupying part of the right lane and the shoulder, which may necessitate a lane change to maintain a safe distance.\n\nTraffic cones are observed on the left side of the road, indicating potential construction or roadwork ahead, which may require the ego car to merge or shift lanes. Moreover, multiple orange traffic cones are positioned in a line marking the boundary between the operational lane and a closed-off lane to the right, indicating the need for the ego car to stay within the operational lane.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on both sides of the road, forming a narrow passage that limits the maneuverability of the ego car and requires careful driving within the restricted lane space. This detailed situational awareness helps in planning safe and efficient driving strategies."

Carefully monitor the cyclists on the right and consider changing lanes to the left if it is safe and legal to do so, in order to pass the cyclists at a safe distance. Continue to follow the lane indicators marked by traffic cones and account for reduced lane width due to the concrete barriers, ensuring that the ego car remains within the lane boundaries. Stay alert for any signs of workers or unexpected obstacles on the road due to the construction. Do not attempt to overtake unless the road ahead is clear and it's safe to do so. Use turn signals appropriately when changing lanes and stay observant for any signs or changes in traffic flow."
