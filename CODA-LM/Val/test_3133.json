These conical markers indicate that a portion of the lane is blocked or closed, and you may need to slow down or possibly change lanes.\n\nParallel to these traffic cones, obstacles featuring reflective elements are also aligned to reinforce the boundaries of the closed road area. These isolation facilities help guide traffic flow and indicate that vehicles should not cross the designated area due to potential hazards or ongoing road construction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a glowing white sign on the right side of the road that may indicate direction or provide critical information relevant to drivers. Even if the content of the sign is unclear, its illumination at night signifies that it may contain important information about self-driving routes or road conditions ahead.\n\nThese elements together suggest caution and careful navigation due to ongoing roadwork and potential hazards."
