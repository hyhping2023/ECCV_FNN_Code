Some of the cars are covered with protective covers, and most of them are not intruding into the driving lane, which reduces the available width of the road and visibility. Due to this, it's crucial for the autonomous vehicle to proceed cautiously and stay alert for any potential obstacles or road users that may be hidden from view.\n\nAs for traffic lights, there are some visible in the distance, but their operational status or signal color is unclear because of the distance and viewing angle. This ambiguity means the vehicle must be ready to either stop or go when it gets closer to the intersection, taking cues from the actual lights or the behavior of the other road users in the vicinity.\n\nLastly, the conditions are compromised by low visibility caused by night-time driving and insufficient street lighting. This scenario necessitates increased vigilance and reduced speeds to safely detect other road users or obstacles in a timely manner.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers reported in the image."

Be prepared to respond to the traffic lights once the ego car is close enough to discern their state. Ensure that headlights and taillights are functioning properly to increase visibility and alertness to other road users. Additionally, due to the lack of visible lane markings, the ego car should ensure it is centered within the perceived lane to avoid collisions with parked vehicles."
