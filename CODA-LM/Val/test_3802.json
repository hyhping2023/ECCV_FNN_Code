This vehicle's size and the equipment it carries may cause it to move slower or make unpredictable movements, directly influencing the ego car's speed and following distance. Additionally, several cars are moving parallel to the ego car in adjacent lanes to the right. These vehicles could impact the ego car's ability to change lanes.\n\nOn the sidewalk parallel to the road on the right side, there are pedestrians and cyclists behind a fence, moving perpendicularly to the ego car. While they do not immediately affect the current driving behavior, it is important to monitor them in case any enter the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic cones visible in the image. However, there is a fence barrier on the right side of the road, separating the bike lane from the pedestrian walkway. Although this barrier does not directly affect the vehicle's driving path, it is part of the roadside infrastructure and defines the borders of the cycling and pedestrian zones.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in this image, so the ego car must base its decisions on the road conditions and traffic flow. Finally, there is no debris or other significant objects on the road that would impact the driving behavior, meaning there is no immediate requirement for evasive action."

Observe the sedan in the right lane in case a lane change becomes necessary to overtake the slower vehicle. Continuously monitor the behavior of the cyclists and ensure that any lane change maneuvers do not endanger them. Continue to drive attentively and respond to any new traffic elements that may come into view, such as traffic lights or signs, which are not currently visible. Refrain from changing lanes unless necessary, due to the presence of multiple vehicles in the rightmost lanes. Follow all traffic laws and signals not captured in the image. Keep a watchful eye on the pedestrians to the right, reducing speed if it seems they may intend to cross or if there's any distraction among them that may lead to one entering the roadway. Additionally, check the side mirrors for a clear path to change lanes if necessary."
