Be prepared to slow down or stop based on the dynamics of pedestrians crossing the road and the vehicle in front. Pay attention to construction obstacles, as there may be road work and changes in traffic patterns. Maintain a safe distance from trucks to prevent accidents in case they suddenly stop or turn. As the traffic light is red and pedestrians are crossing the street, come to a complete stop. Given that wet road conditions may affect braking and handling, remain highly focused while driving.",
