        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic image, the primary road users include vehicles and other objects. \n\nThere are two key observations in the vehicles category:\n1. A white car located ahead in the same lane has its red taillights on, suggesting it is either moving slowly or has come to a stop. This requires consideration of slowing down, stopping, or changing lanes to maintain a safe distance.\n2. In the distance, there are oncoming vehicles with their headlights on, indicating traffic flow in the opposite lane. This informs the need for caution and affects the decision-making process when considering lane changes or turns.\n\nAdditionally, in the other objects category, there are lighting fixtures for street lamps or signs situated on the right, reflecting on the wet surface and causing glare. This glare can temporarily blind drivers; hence, the autonomous driving system should adjust its sensors to minimize glare impact and maintain a clear view of the road ahead.\n\nCategories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the slippery road conditions possibly affecting traction, please proceed with caution. If necessary to avoid a red cleaning vehicle parked on the right, prepare to change lanes to the left after ensuring it is safe and checking that there are no oncoming vehicles in the left lane. Continue to pay attention to the traffic lights and comply with any changes. Stay alert and be aware of any additional signs that become evident and their messages. Decrease speed due to the wet and slippery conditions to prevent skidding or hydroplaning. Adjust sensors to reduce glare and maintain visibility. Maintain a safe distance from the white car, and be vigilant of any potential movement from the parked trucks. Your vehicle should also be aware of the oncoming traffic and be prepared to respond to other road users who may be temporarily invisible due to nighttime conditions. If the green traffic light is part of your intended route, continue towards the green light, but remain vigilant for any changes in the signal, as you may need to stop.",

The brightness and orientation of the taillights suggest that it is stopped or moving slowly. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down to avoid a collision. Observation of this vehicle's signals and behavior is crucial for the ego car's decision-making process as it needs to anticipate potential sudden movements or continued stagnation of this vehicle in its path.",
