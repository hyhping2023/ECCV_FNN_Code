This vehicle presents an immediate obstacle requiring the ego car to either halt or change lanes to continue safely. Directly ahead of the construction vehicle, on the road, there is a worker engaged with either the vehicle or a road obstruction, signaling ongoing construction activity that demands reduced speed and heightened caution.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic light situated in the upper right corner, which mandates that the ego car comes to a stop and waits for a green signal to proceed. On the right side of the construction vehicle, there are temporary orange road barriers indicating either an area closure or redirection of traffic, enforcing an alteration to the usual traffic patterns that the ego car must follow for secure navigation.\n\nLastly, on the far right side of the image, a line of parked bicycles in a bicycle parking area indicates frequent cyclist activity in the vicinity. This doesn't immediately affect the driving path of the ego car but alerts to the possibility of cyclists entering the road from this parking area."

Lane changes should be considered only if safe and legal to do so, and after considering the barriers and the space available on the road."
