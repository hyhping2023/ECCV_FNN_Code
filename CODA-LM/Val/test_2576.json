Pay close attention to the white sedan moving through the yard to see if there are any unpredictable movements, and be prepared to adjust your driving route or speed at any time. Monitor parked and partially obscured vehicles to prevent them from potentially entering your path. Moreover, keep an appropriate distance from the vehicles parked on the right side, carefully adjust your lateral position, and be mindful of oncoming white vehicles. Obey all visible traffic signs, which suggest not to park or wait in the area, and adhere to any indicated speed limits or restrictions. Self-driving cars should also be ready to brake or swerve to avoid dogs on the road while ensuring not to enter the opposite lane. It is advisable to continuously monitor any movement from vehicles parked by the roadside.",
