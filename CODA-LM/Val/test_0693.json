This van could open its doors or start moving unexpectedly, influencing the driving behavior.\n   - Multiple other parked vehicles are present on both sides of the road, in various sizes and colors, creating a narrow path for the ego vehicle. This narrow gap requires the ego car to slow down and maneuver carefully to avoid potential collisions.\n   - A motorcycle with a rider is positioned in the center of the image, moving away from the ego vehicle. Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users who might make sudden moves; hence, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A cyclist is in motion on the road, ahead of the ego vehicle, slightly to the left side. The cyclist could change speed or direction, impacting the ego vehicle's path and requiring speed adjustments.\n   - A motorcyclist is in the center of the lane ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The close proximity to the ego car requires readiness to decelerate or change lanes if the motorcyclist stops or changes direction unexpectedly.\n\n3. **Other Objects**:\n   - There are bins with materials next to the parked vehicles on the right side, possibly encroaching on the road. Materials from the bins could spill onto the road or the bins themselves could act as obstacles if not properly placed.\n   - A street stall is set up on the side of the road, including bins with items, potentially encroaching onto the road. Possible pedestrian activity around the stall could lead to individuals unexpectedly entering the roadway, thus careful driving is advised."
