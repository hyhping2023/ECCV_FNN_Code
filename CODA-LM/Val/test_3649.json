It's important to pay attention to any additional signs on the road or changes in traffic patterns due to construction work, while also noting the flow of traffic guided by barriers. Stay alert to react to any further instructions or changes in road conditions and be ready to merge left as traffic cones ahead indicate the lanes gradually narrowing.
