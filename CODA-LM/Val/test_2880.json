This truck, due to its function, indicates a potential for slow movement or being stationary. Its large size and the possibility of making sudden stops for construction tasks affect the ego car's need to maintain a safe following distance and control its speed accordingly. Additionally, a red traffic light is visible above the road in the direction the ego car is traveling. This light requires the ego car to stop at the intersection to comply with traffic laws and ensure safety."

In this scenario, the ego car must maintain a safe distance from this heavy vehicle, as such vehicles often make wide turns and may stop unexpectedly at construction sites. The size and weight of the vehicle could also affect stopping distances, so the ego car must be cautious to avoid collisions and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops in traffic flow caused by the truck's presence or operations.",
