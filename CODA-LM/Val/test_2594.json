        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, a few notable road users and objects are affecting the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nOne vehicle that stands out is a forklift, which is located in the same lane just ahead of our vehicle. It is facing away from us and seems to be either stationary or moving slowly. The potential movement and presence of the forklift will require our vehicle to adjust its speed and possibly change lanes while proceeding forward.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user in the scene: a motorcyclist is spotted at a distance, traveling in the opposite direction. As motorcyclists can be more unpredictable and less stable than four-wheeled vehicles, our autonomous vehicle will need to closely monitor this motorcyclist and maintain a safe following distance, ensuring it doesn't make any unexpected turns or stops that could risk safety.\n\nLastly, the boundaries of the vehicular pathway are marked by fences and obstacles on both sides of the road. These objects serve as a guide for defining the driving route, ensuring that the autonomous vehicle remains within the designated driving lanes and avoids straying from its path.\n\nThe data doesn't report the presence of any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers within the traffic image being analyzed. Therefore, those categories are not considered in this summarization."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to forklift operations on-site, this vehicle should reduce speed and be prepared to stop or yield, maintaining a safe distance and adjusting speed according to the movements of the forklift. Additionally, attention should be given to distant motorcyclists to anticipate potential changes in traffic dynamics. It is recommended to drive cautiously, always being alert to any road users or obstacles that might enter the driving path.",

Mopeds are used both for personal transportation and sometimes for delivery services. In traffic, these vehicles are typically slower and less visible than larger vehicles, so it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be cautious when making maneuvers to ensure the safety of the moped rider.",

Forklifts are designed to move and lift heavy materials and are commonly seen in construction zones and industrial areas. Their presence in a driving scenario indicates that there may be construction activity nearby. Forklifts move slower than typical road vehicles and may make sudden stops or turns. The ego car should slow down when approaching, maintain a vigilant watch for signals from the forklift operator, and be prepared for unexpected movements or construction-related obstacles.",
