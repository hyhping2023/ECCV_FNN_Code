Firstly, there is a blue truck parked on the left side of the road, facing away from our vehicle's direction. The truck is currently stationary, but it is important for our vehicle to slightly adjust its position to the right to ensure a safe passing distance. Secondly, there is a red van also parked on the left side of the road ahead, but it is facing towards our vehicle. The red van's position could potentially disrupt the flow of traffic or pose a risk if its doors were to open onto the road. Additionally, the presence of the blue truck may reduce the available space for our vehicle to navigate safely. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

Given the narrow street, as well as parked vehicles and animals, a cautious and vigilant driving approach is recommended.",
