Its orientation is facing the opposite direction, and the ego car can see its right side. This situation is noteworthy because the parked truck may partially block the lane, meaning that the autonomous driving system must execute careful maneuvering to navigate around the obstacle safely. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in this scenario."

The vehicle is painted with highly visible colors and has reflective markings, suggesting it may be a service or emergency support vehicle used for road assistance or maintenance. The rear doors of the vehicle are open, which indicates the presence of personnel possibly working nearby. Consequently, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution, being mindful of any sudden movements from the stopped vehicle or the potential presence of workers in the vicinity.",

The driver should check for oncoming traffic from the opposite direction before manoeuvring around the truck, considering the curvature of the road could potentially obstruct the view of oncoming vehicles. Using turn signals to indicate the intention to pass the parked vehicle is also advised for safety and clear communication to other road users."
