The presence of the truck indicates it might be moving slowly, requiring the ego car to consider overtaking or maintaining a safe following distance."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, which can be identified as such due to its heavy-duty build, visible mechanical boom arms, and possible attachments that are typical for vehicles used on construction sites. In this driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle indicates potential road work ahead. As a result, the ego vehicle may need to slow down, watch for posted signage indicating detours or reduced speed limits, and be ready to stop or navigate around the construction zone. Caution and attentiveness to changes in the road conditions should be exercised due to the possible presence of construction workers, temporary traffic lights, and other construction-related hazards.",

If overtaking is considered, ensure there is sufficient visibility ahead and no oncoming traffic. Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, being prepared to slow down if the truck stops or turns. Continuous monitoring of the truck's activities and adjusting speed and position as necessary is also advisable to maintain safety."
