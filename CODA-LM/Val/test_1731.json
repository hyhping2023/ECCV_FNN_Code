While the vehicle is not currently in the way, we must remain vigilant should it begin to move or if passengers attempt to open their doors into oncoming traffic, as this could pose potential hazards.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the left side of the road moving towards our vehicle's direction. There is a risk that the pedestrian could unexpectedly enter the roadway, so we must be prepared to halt or execute emergency maneuvers if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported that could influence the vehicle's driving behavior in this particular image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of a small dog and pedestrians walking along the road, the vehicle should reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. Vehicles should carefully navigate around parked cars, especially at bends where visibility may be obstructed. Moreover, drivers should pay close attention to any changes in vehicles that have activated their hazard lights and should be ready to yield to pedestrians, ensuring the safety of the small dog by stopping if it does not move out of the way. Maintain a low speed and be prepared to brake for the small dog on the road, and keep an eye on pedestrians in case they decide to cross the street. Since there are no immediate traffic signs or signals at present, the vehicle should proceed with caution and be ready to stop at any time.",
