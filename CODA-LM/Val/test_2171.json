This vehicle directly affects the ego car's ability to proceed, necessitating a safe following distance and preparedness to stop if needed.\n   - Another vehicle, possibly a taxi or commercial vehicle with a yellow top, is on the right side of the intersection, facing the ego car's direction but on the opposite side of the road. This vehicle may enter the intersection when the traffic signal changes, so the ego car needs to monitor it for potential crossing or turning movements.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A 'No Entry' sign is visible to the left of the image, indicating a road or lane where vehicles are not permitted to enter. The ego car should avoid turning left to prevent entering a prohibited area.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - A traffic light showing a red signal is directly ahead of the ego car. The ego car must come to a complete stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - A construction vehicle with a flashing light is situated on the right side ahead, though not in the direct path of the ego car. The presence of this construction vehicle suggests the possibility of workers or obstacles nearby, necessitating extra caution from the ego car."

The ego car should not turn left due to the 'No Entry' sign. Once the traffic light turns green, it should proceed with caution, especially if the construction vehicle becomes an obstruction or if there are any changes in the road conditions ahead."
