        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a red car on the left side of the main vehicle, located in the adjacent lane and slightly ahead. It could be moving at a similar speed or stopped due to traffic. This vehicle may pose a danger in the adjacent lane, as it could affect the main vehicle's lane change or potentially merge into the main vehicle's lane.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow taxi is present in front of our car, traveling in the same direction and occupying the middle lane. The main vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the taxi to ensure safety.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a small gray truck loaded with oranges, which appears to be parked or moving very slowly, partially blocking the lane. Our vehicle may need to change lanes to avoid this obstacle, and attention should be paid to the potential falling of cargo from the truck, which could affect road conditions and require evasive action.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a metal fence which may indicate the presence of a pedestrian area or a construction zone. This could narrow the drivable road and suggest the possibility of pedestrian activity nearby.\n\nThere are also blue barriers along the center of the road separating the opposing lanes of traffic. These barriers guide the path of self-driving vehicles and prohibit any left turns or crossing over to the opposite side of the road.\n\nLastly, on the right-side sidewalk, there is a small structure resembling a pavilion or stall. While it does not affect the driving lane, being aware of such structures near the road is important for overall situational awareness in an urban environment.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current situation, our vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the red car on the left. If the yellow taxi ahead slows down, be prepared to decelerate accordingly and observe the truck's behavior. If the truck is stationary or moving slowly, get ready to change lanes to the left. Vehicles on the opposite side are in a different stream of traffic and do not require immediate action. Moreover, our vehicle should pay attention to the area around the metal guardrail on the right, as it may affect pedestrian behavior and potentially narrow the lanes. Due to the road being wet or dirty, appropriately reduce speed to ensure a safe stopping distance and better vehicle control. Keep in the current lane, following the road guardrail and the direction of traffic flow.",

The presence of a pedestrian near the roadway is a critical factor for the ego car to consider. The ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop to yield the right-of-way, especially if the pedestrian steps onto the crossing. Vigilance is required to ensure the pedestrian's safety and to adhere to traffic regulations regarding pedestrian priority.",
