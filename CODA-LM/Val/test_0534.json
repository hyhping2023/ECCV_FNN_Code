        "description and explanation": "In the provided image, there are several road users and objects impacting driving behavior. \n\nFirst, there is a large cement mixer truck directly in front of the vehicle, occupying the same lane. The truckâ€™s cylindrical mixing drum and lit brake lights indicate that it is either slowing down or has already stopped. This necessitates that our vehicle maintains a safe following distance and is prepared to stop or slow down based on the truck's movements.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the traffic. The cyclist is wearing dark clothing and staying close to the roadside. This requires drivers to be mindful of the cyclist's presence, anticipate potential merging movements, and ensure there is enough space for safe overtaking.\n\nAlso, barriers are present, specifically a central divider that separates opposing lanes and a metal fence on the right that isolates the road from the pedestrian area. These obstacles mark the road boundaries that the autonomous vehicle must not cross, delineating areas where pedestrian activity may occur."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck and be vigilant of cyclists when traffic permits to ensure a safe pass if necessary. Considering the slippery road conditions, drivers should adjust their speed to maintain safety and carefully watch the truck's brake lights and any potential hazards, such as sudden stops or debris falling from the mixer. Additionally, drivers should pay attention to any possible lane changes after confirming it is safe to do so.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy construction vehicle with a rotating drum, typically used for mixing and transporting concrete. The drum is mounted on the rear of the truck and can often be seen rotating during transport to prevent the concrete from solidifying. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road indicates that there may be a construction site nearby, and it suggests the need for increased alertness while driving. Due to the size and operating nature of such vehicles, they often move slower than regular traffic and may make sudden stops or maneuvers linked to their operation. Thus, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, anticipate slower speeds, and be prepared for unexpected actions from the construction vehicle.",
