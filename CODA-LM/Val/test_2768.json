        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two notable vehicle-related observations. Firstly, on the opposite lane, most of the oncoming vehicles have their headlights on, which suggests that there might be low visibility conditions or it could be nighttime. This requires our autonomous vehicle to maintain strict lane discipline and to ensure that its headlights are adjusted properly to avoid causing discomfort to other drivers. Secondly, there is a stationary truck parked on the right side of the road, adjacent to our lane. The truck is surrounded by goods, which indicates the presence of vendors or customers. This situation necessitates increased vigilance from our vehicle as there may be pedestrians obscured by the truck or unexpected movements from vendors or customers. Consequently, our vehicle must be prepared to stop or maneuver at any moment to ensure safety. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the image."
