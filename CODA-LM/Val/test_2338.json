        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that the ego vehicle must consider. On the left side, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, there is a yellow taxi. The presence of the taxi means the ego vehicle must be cautious, as the taxi could change lanes or slow down unexpectedly to pick up passengers. Therefore, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a large truck carrying yellow machinery. The truck's size may block the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead, and its movements are likely to be slower and require more space. The ego vehicle should keep a safe distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or turns the truck might make.\n\nOn the right side, scooters are traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, with one particularly close. Scooters are nimble and their movements can be unpredictable, so the ego vehicle needs to be aware of them to avoid any dangerous situations.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous motorcyclists and cyclists on the right side of the road, also moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. These vulnerable road users could change their direction or lane at any time, and it is important for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance from them as well.\n\nThe traffic image also includes directional signs on the right side over the road, indicating a curve or intersection ahead. These signs suggest that the ego vehicle should be ready for other vehicles that may turn or exit shortly.\n\nA green traffic light is present directly over the intersection ahead, signaling that the ego vehicle can proceed. However, it is still necessary to be vigilant for other road users who might disregard their red light.\n\nLastly, there is white fencing along the median of the road, which serves to separate the traffic moving in opposite directions and helps to minimize the risk of head-on collisions by keeping vehicles in their respective lanes.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Follow directional signs and road markings to navigate the upcoming road layout safely. Additionally, monitor the movements of the scooter riders on the right and be prepared for any erratic behavior."
