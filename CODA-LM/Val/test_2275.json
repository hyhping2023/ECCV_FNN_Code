Additionally, there is a movable barrier with reflective strips and warning lights positioned in the middle of the lane, suggesting road construction or a change in traffic patterns. This requires vehicles to slow down or change lanes as necessary for safe passage. Furthermore, an obstacle marked with signs is present in the middle of the road, possibly indicating a pedestrian crossing or road construction. This obstacle, illuminated by the green traffic light, necessitates that vehicles reduce speed or be ready to take an alternative route. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."

Approach obstacles with caution and be prepared to stop or take a detour as indicated by the signs on the obstacle. Adjust your speed appropriately to ensure the safe passage around the obstacle, and stay alert to any additional instructions or changes in the driving environment.",
