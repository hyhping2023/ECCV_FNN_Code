This truck is significant because its size and movement can impact our vehicle's maneuvering capabilities on the road. It is especially relevant when considering actions such as overtaking, navigating intersections, or dealing with possible oncoming traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic cone positioned on the left side, towards the center of the road, which could suggest the presence of roadworks or obstacles ahead. As a result, the vehicle should remain alert and may need to adjust its path, possibly taking a detour, due to the signaled potential hazard.\n\nFurthermore, there are several barriers identified on the right side of the image. These barriers could restrict the vehicle's ability to move laterally, particularly when attempting to overtake other vehicles or evade unforeseen barriers on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the possibility of a wet and slippery road surface, and with a large truck ahead in the lane, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed. Traffic cones indicate that the driver should be alert to potential obstacles or road construction ahead. Obstacles on the right suggest that overtaking may be unsafe or not possible, hence maintaining lane discipline is important. In the absence of visible traffic signs or signals, the driver should adhere to the basic traffic rules for such roads and remain vigilant for any unforeseen situations or changes in the traffic environment. Additionally, the vehicle should be prepared to respond to the traffic lights at intersections.",

In this scenario, its presence may indicate a construction zone, an obstruction, or a change in traffic patterns ahead, prompting the driver of the ego car to slow down and proceed with caution, possibly preparing to follow a detour or merge into another lane.",
