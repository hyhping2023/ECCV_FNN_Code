This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop.\n\nAdditionally, a bus is visible to the left of the ego car. Only the rear section of the bus is shown, with its rear lights on. The ego car must be aware of the bus's proximity, especially when considering lane changes, turning, or keeping a safe distance.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians are present, and one appears to be looking towards the street, which may suggest an intention to cross or step onto the roadway. The ego car must exercise caution in anticipation of the pedestrians potentially entering the street unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, there are reflections and glare on the windshield, which could impair visibility. This condition requires the driver or autonomous system to proceed with additional caution due to the reduced ability to perceive the environment accurately.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

Additionally, the driver should monitor the bus to the left to prevent any potential side-swipe collision if the bus encroaches into the ego car's lane. The driver should be vigilant for any movements from pedestrians on the right that may affect traffic. Since lane markers are not visible, caution should be exercised when maneuvering around the truck, and indicators should be used to signal intentions to other road users. Lastly, the driver should assess visibility conditions and clean the windshield if the reflections or glare significantly impair visibility."
