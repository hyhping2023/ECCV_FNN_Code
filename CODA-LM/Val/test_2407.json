In a traffic context, pedestrians are generally found on sidewalks, crosswalks, and other designated walking areas.

The vehicle should not proceed until the traffic light turns green and the pedestrians have safely cleared the crossing area. Keeping a cautious watch for any additional pedestrians or vehicles approaching the crossing would be prudent. Additionally, the driver should remain alert for the pedestrians on the right side of the road and ensure they do not enter the roadway, adjusting the vehicle's position if necessary to provide them with enough space. Finally, monitoring the white sedan ahead should continue in case it makes any sudden moves that would require the ego car to respond."
