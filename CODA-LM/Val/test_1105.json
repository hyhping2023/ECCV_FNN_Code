This car is currently unmanned and stationary, prompting our vehicle to be vigilant for any potential movements, as the available driving space is reduced and the parked car might start moving unexpectedly.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, there is a pedestrian who is walking in the same direction as the flow of traffic on their respective side but is not currently affecting our vehicle's path. Despite this, drivers must remain aware of pedestrians since there's a risk they might step onto the road.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is spotted riding on the left side of our lane, coming towards our vehicle. This presents a situation requiring increased caution; hence, our vehicle may need to change lanes to ensure a safe passing distance.\n\nWe also observe barriers, including a divider to the left that separates the sidewalk from the road, defining the boundaries of the driving area without intruding upon the lane. Intermittent bollards are also installed along the left side of the road, helping delineate the sides of the lane and guide vehicular movement without representing an immediate dynamic threat.\n\nBesides, there are fixed bicycles parked on the sidewalk. They are not directly impacting the drivability of the road, but serve as a reminder to be vigilant in case individuals approach to use them.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to parked vehicles, please drive carefully and pay attention to the yield signs, which may indicate an upcoming intersection or pedestrian crosswalk. Maintain a safe driving speed, and be prepared to respond to changes in the parked white car or traffic flow. Be aware of pedestrians on the sidewalk, and be ready to react if they suddenly step onto the road. Pay attention to whether the white car parked opposite is making any movements. If you need to maintain a safe passing distance from cyclists, be prepared to change lanes or appropriately adjust your vehicle position. When approaching areas with yield or warning signs, slow down if necessary, and remain alert for potential hazards that may require yielding or taking other defensive driving actions. Continue to monitor road conditions and sign changes, to respond to any changes that might affect your driving behavior.",
