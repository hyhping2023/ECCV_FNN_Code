However, there is an object of interest off the roadway. Specifically, there are large spools of cable located to the right of the road which, while currently not posing an immediate hazard, could potentially become a road obstruction due to their proximity to the edge of the roadway. As these objects are stationary and off the roadway but sizable and close to the road, there is a concern that they might roll or be moved onto the roadway, thus becoming a hazard. The ego vehicle should be aware and monitor these objects while passing to ensure safe navigation and preparedness for any potential changes in the roadway conditions."

The driver should, however, remain vigilant for the presence of any unexpected obstacles or workers in the vicinity when such materials are noticed, as they may indicate nearby construction or maintenance activity.",

Nonetheless, the presence of such industrial equipment suggests that the vehicle may be in an area with potential construction or utility work, and the driver should be alert for related signage or changes in traffic patterns nearby.",
