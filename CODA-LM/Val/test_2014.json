        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two types of vehicles present which have implications for driving behavior. The first one described is a red and grey forklift parked partially on the sidewalk and partially on the road surface on the left side. Due to its prominent colors and markings, it becomes very visible to oncoming traffic. This parked forklift could potentially be an obstacle as it is encroaching onto the road, which might necessitate either changing lanes or maneuvering cautiously around it. The second type of vehicle observed are white sedan cars parked in a line along the left side of the road, parallel to the road. These parked cars do not pose a direct threat to our vehicle; however, they do reduce the available road width. This situation requires the vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the line of parked cars and to remain alert for any doors that may open unexpectedly or pedestrians that might appear suddenly from between the parked cars. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the observed traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "While maintaining a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the left, drive cautiously. If necessary, be prepared to change lanes to avoid the forklift and pay attention to the traffic lights when approaching intersections. Keep a safe distance from the white car in front, and be ready to slightly adjust the lane position to the right to safely pass the parked forklift. Also, be aware of oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. Maintain a moderate speed and stay alert to the potential movements of pedestrians near the parked forklift and the parking area on the left. Be prepared to respond to any parked vehicles starting up or pedestrian activities. Additionally, ensure a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the left to avoid potential obstructions.",

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, is present to the left in the image. It is characterized by its industrial design, a lift mechanism at the front for handling materials, and safety features like warning lights and a striped pattern for visibility. The presence of such a vehicle indicates potential construction activities nearby. For the ego car, this would mean being cautious of possible obstructions or workers on or near the road ahead and being prepared to slow down or stop if necessary for safety.",
