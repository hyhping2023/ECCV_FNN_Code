This indicates it's a heavy and slow-moving vehicle, which affects the ego car's following distance and overtaking maneuvers.\n2. **Red bus**: Located in the left lane, parallel to the ego car. The bus may make frequent stops or merge right, requiring the ego car to remain vigilant.\n3. **White sedan**: Ahead of the ego car in the right lane. The presence of the sedan necessitates caution from the ego vehicle when considering a lane change to the right.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n- **Yellow road markings and signs on the barriers to the left**: Indicating no entry or caution for the direction on the left side of the barriers. These signs instruct the ego car to avoid the restricted area and adhere to the correct traffic flow on the open roadway.\n\n**Barriers:**\n- **Median strip with barriers and yellow signs on the left**: These barriers separate different traffic directions or roadway sections, guiding the traffic flow and preventing the ego vehicle from crossing into oncoming traffic or restricted areas.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n- **Reflection on the windshield**: This causes a slight visual obstruction, potentially impacting the perception systems of an autonomous vehicle. The system needs to ensure redundancy to manage visual distortions effectively.\n\nThis summarization highlights the key road users and objects influencing the driving decisions of the ego car in the provided traffic image."
