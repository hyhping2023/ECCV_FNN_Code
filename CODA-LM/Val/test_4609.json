The car is covered with a reflective cover and is facing the same direction as our vehicle. This stationary vehicle poses no immediate dynamic threats; however, the reflective cover obscures it, potentially causing unexpected movements or sudden appearances of people. Therefore, it's essential for our vehicle to maintain a safe distance while passing.\n\nAdditionally, there is an illuminated billboard on the right-hand sidewalk, positioned above the ground. While billboards are not direct road users, the illumination they provide can improve the visibility of our vehicle at night."

Slow down and stay alert for pedestrians ahead. Continue to watch for any changes on the road. As the parked vehicle covered may suddenly create an obstacle, and the blue cover might hide potential dangers, exercise caution when driving. Because night conditions reduce visibility, maintain a lower speed and be prepared for the possibility that pedestrians or other unexpected movements might suddenly emerge from blind spots or covered areas.",
