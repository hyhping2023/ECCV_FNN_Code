The ego car may need to change lanes to avoid passing too close to it, especially considering any potential movements from the truck or loading activities."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are vehicles and vulnerable road users present, which significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a large flatbed truck parked on the right side of the road. Though its back end is slightly intruding into the driving lane, no cargo is visible on the flatbed. Visible forklift arms raised above suggest that there might be ongoing loading activities. This could potentially narrow the lane width available for the ego car, prompting the need for a lane change to safely navigate past the obstruction. Additionally, the possibility of sudden movements from the truck or the ongoing loading activities demands increased caution from the ego car.\n\nConcerning vulnerable road users, a pedestrian is spotted walking alongside the road, in the same direction as the ego car, near the parked truck. The pedestrian's attention is not towards the traffic, raising concerns over their sudden entry onto the road or attempted crossing without notice. Despite the pedestrian not being directly on the road, the proximity to the traffic lane poses a potential hazard. Hence, it is crucial for the ego car to keep a watchful eye on the pedestrian's movements and be prepared for any unexpected actions.\n\nNotably, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene, allowing the focus to remain solely on the vehicle and pedestrian dynamics."

Maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian, giving them a wide berth, and be prepared to stop if necessary. After passing the truck and pedestrian, the car can resume normal traveling speed if the road ahead is clear. Continue to monitor the pedestrian and maintain a safe speed. Prepare to change lanes if the situation with the parked truck requires it, making sure to signal and check blind spots accordingly. Stay vigilant for any additional road users or signs that may come into view, and adjust driving behavior as necessary to maintain safety. Proceed cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the parked truck. Be prepared to slow down or stop if the pedestrian steps into the roadway. If the ego car is on the same lane as the truck, it should signal and safely merge into the left lane if it's free of traffic. Always monitor the pedestrian's movements and be ready to react if their behavior suggests a potential entry into the ego car's path."
