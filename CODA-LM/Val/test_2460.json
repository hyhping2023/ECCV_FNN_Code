        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several road users and elements require attention for safe autonomous driving. Vehicles in this image consist of several parked vehicles on the right side of the road. These vehicles are parallel parked, with lights off and stationary, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintains a safe berth to avert potential risks such as doors opening or pedestrians appearing suddenly from between these vehicles. Additionally, there's a white car traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle in an adjacent lane to the left. This car poses a potential risk as it could change lanes or adjust its speed, impacting the driving decision of the ego vehicle directly.\n\nThe traffic scene also includes a red traffic light situated in the distance on the right side, above the road. This red light requires vehicles in its lane to come to a stop, potentially including the ego vehicle if it's headed towards this light, necessitating preparedness to halt.\n\nBarriers are present, including a raised median barrier replete with plantings directly in front of the ego vehicle. This barrier demarcates the lanes of opposing traffic, signaling the necessity for the ego vehicle to either veer right or left to avoid a head-on collision if proceeding straight ahead. Another barrier identified is a metal fence barrier separating the parked cars from the roadway, functioning as a deterrent for pedestrians, which minimizes the risk of unexpected pedestrian crossings from the area of parked cars.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the significant road users and elements present in the traffic scene that influence the driving behaviors and decisions required for safe navigation by the ego vehicle. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this scenario, focusing attention primarily on the vehicles, traffic light, and barriers identified."

It should also maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the right to allow for reaction time in case a pedestrian emerges. Additionally, the ego vehicle should monitor the white car on the left for any lane changes or speed alterations and prepare to respond accordingly. Given the raised median barrier directly ahead, the ego vehicle should decide whether to make a left or right turn well before reaching the barrier to ensure a safe maneuver. Maintain current lane and reduce speed in preparation for a potential stop due to the red traffic light ahead. Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle on the left and monitor it for any lane changing or overtaking behaviors. Stay alert for any activity around the parked cars, although the barrier provides some safety buffer."
