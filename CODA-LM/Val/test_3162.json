Although these vehicles are stationary and not participating in the flow of traffic, their presence reduces the navigable width of the road for the ego vehicle. Additionally, an array of red and white traffic cones is set up along the right edge of the road, signifying a division between the driving lane and a construction zone. These cones suggest that drivers need to be attentive and potentially merge to the left due to a narrowed lane and the presence of possible hazards. Complementing the traffic cones are temporary fencing barriers, which reinforce the need for caution and slower speeds in this area. The barriers further indicate that there might be workers or machinery in close proximity to the driving lane which drivers should be wary of."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is an object designed to be highly visible and serve as a temporary traffic control device. Its bright color and reflective material make it noticeable to drivers, even during nighttime or low-visibility conditions. Typically, traffic cones are used to mark areas where drivers need to be cautious or to indicate that there are changes in normal traffic patterns, such as lane closures or construction zones. The presence of a traffic cone suggests that the ego car may need to adjust its course to avoid the marked area, reduce speed, and be aware of potential hazards or construction workers nearby.",

It typically comes in bright colors like orange, with reflective striping to increase visibility at night or in low-light conditions. The presence of traffic cones usually indicates that there may be roadwork ahead, a temporary traffic pattern change, or potential hazards on the road. As a result, the driver of the ego car should slow down, be vigilant, and be prepared to follow any new path defined by the arrangement of the cones or as directed by road signs or construction crew instructions. The ego car should also maintain a safe distance from the cones to avoid any damage to the vehicle or the construction area.",

It's also advisable to turn on headlights if not already activated due to the low-light conditions and wet road surface to increase visibility to other road users. Additionally, the ego vehicle should keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles to avoid any conflicts should a door open or a pedestrian emerge from between vehicles."
