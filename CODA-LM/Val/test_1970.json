The vehicle should be monitored for its speed and trajectory to maintain a safe distance.\n- A green truck is parked on the left side of the road, away from the traffic lane. Vigilance is required in case it starts moving.\n- A white passenger vehicle is located in front of the car, moving in the same direction, which will influence the following distance and speed.\n\nA vulnerable road user, specifically a pedestrian with a dog, is crossing the street from right to left in front of the car. This requires the vehicle to wait until they have safely crossed.\n\nA traffic sign, a no parking sign, is seen on the left, indicating that parking is not allowed along this roadside.\n\nThere is a barrier, a striped yellow and black one, on the left side of the vehicle to guide traffic flow. The vehicle should travel in the direction of this barrier to avoid entering the restricted area."

Simultaneously, it should maintain a safe distance from the white SUV on the right to accommodate any potential changes in its course. Traffic rules indicated by the no-parking signs should be adhered to. Given the identified road users and signs, the vehicle should slow down to let pedestrians and their dog cross the street safely. The vehicle should also be prepared to follow lane changes indicated by obstacles and should not consider parking due to the 'No Parking' signs. After the pedestrians have safely crossed the street, continue to drive cautiously while being mindful of any potential movements from the parked truck.",
