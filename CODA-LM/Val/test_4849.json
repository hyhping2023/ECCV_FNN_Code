        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under review, several road users and objects are visible, affecting the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle. \n\nFirstly, there's a dark-colored sedan parked on the right side of the road, facing our direction. The positioning of this sedan poses a risk as it could potentially enter the road suddenly, necessitating our vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop to avoid any potential hazard.\n\nNear this area, there is a traffic cone positioned on the left side of the sedan. The presence of this cone signals potential dangers or road construction zones, indicating the need for our vehicle to detour around this obstacle.\n\nMoreover, on the right side of our vehicle's path, there's a concerning sight of a figure lying on the ground, which appears to be a kitten. This situation requires immediate attention as it involves stopping the vehicle, circumventing the obstacle, or offering assistance to ensure the safety of the animal.\n\nAdjacent to these road users, various debris and fragments are scattered near the parked vehicles. This assortment of objects should be approached with caution by our autonomous vehicle as they may pose hazards or conceal additional risks.\n\nIn summary, our navigation through this scene needs to carefully consider these factors – the parked sedan’s potential movement, the road obstacle indicated by the traffic cone, the vulnerable position of a kitten, and the scattering of possibly hazardous debris. Each element demands specific responses from our autonomous vehicle to ensure safe passage through this complex traffic environment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Exercise caution when approaching parked cars and traffic cones, and if necessary, slow down to ensure safe passage. Be prepared to deal with unexpected obstacles and offer assistance to pedestrians in need. Pay attention to parked vehicles for any signs of movement, and be ready to comply with partially visible parking signs. Maintain a safe distance from parked cars and be ready to confront any spontaneous obstacles. Use low beam headlights to improve visibility and to alert other road users who may not have seen your vehicle.",
