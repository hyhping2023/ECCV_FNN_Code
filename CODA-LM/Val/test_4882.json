Vehicles: Several cars and a truck are in the left lane ahead, potentially slowing down or stopping due to the situation ahead. This indicates traffic congestion, suggesting that the self-driving car may need to slow down and prepare for frequently stopping and starting traffic conditions.\n\n2. Traffic Signs: There is an overhead gantry sign that indicates the direction of travel for each lane. These signs provide the necessary lane guidance to ensure proper navigation.\n\n3. Barriers: Both sides of the highway are equipped with guardrails, limiting the ability to make emergency stops or perform emergency maneuvers. The presence of these obstacles means that the vehicle must be more cautious, staying within the lane and unable to take evasive actions outside of the lane boundaries.\n\n4. Other Objects: On the right edge of the right lane, there are some boxes or debris. These objects may pose a hazard, necessitating a slight lateral adjustment to the left to avoid them."

    "driving_suggestion": "Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, especially fire engines, to be prepared for potential sudden stops or changes in traffic flow due to emergencies. Additionally, autonomous vehicles should be ready to change lanes when necessary, all the while adhering to all traffic laws regarding yielding to emergency vehicles. Observing the behavior of other drivers in the left lane can also provide clues on how to respond to upcoming situations. If traffic ahead comes to a halt, be prepared to stop completely. Keep a safe distance from large trucks ahead, closely monitor for any abrupt changes in the cars in your lane, and be ready to adjust your lateral position to avoid debris in the right lane. Stay alert for any instructions from overhead signs or exits that you need to take, and prepare for necessary lane changes well in advance.",
