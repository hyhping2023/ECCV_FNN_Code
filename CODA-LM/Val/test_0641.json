                "explanation": "The stationary position of the first car makes it unlikely to immediately affect the ego car's path, but if it were to suddenly move, it could become an obstacle. The presence of the second car with rear lights on suggests activity which could indicate a potential for movement or a door opening, requiring caution."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are three vehicles of note. The first is a white car parked on the right side, facing the ego car. Although it is stationary and may not pose an immediate threat, its sudden movement could create an obstacle, requiring vigilance from the ego car. The second vehicle is a smaller white vehicle, also on the right, with its rear lights on, which could indicate that it is occupied or in the middle of parking, necessitating caution from the ego car for any potential movement or doors opening. Finally, there is a silver car parked alongside, angled away, indicative of a parking situation. This car itself is not an immediate hazard but suggests the need for careful driving to navigate probable tight spaces. Additionally, a third car parked ahead of the first white car, which is less visible due to poor lighting conditions, is presumed to be white or light-colored. Occupants might exit or enter this car, so the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be ready for unexpected movements or open doors. The image contains no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that need to be considered in this summary."

The car is parked on the side of a road or in a parking area, potentially obstructing a part of the lane. For future driving behavior, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution to safely navigate around the parked car, ensuring there is no oncoming traffic from the opposite direction and maintaining a safe distance from the parked car to avoid any collisions, particularly if the parked car's doors were to open or if pedestrians were to walk around it.",

It is partially illuminated, indicating the presence of either street lighting or another vehicle's headlights. The orientation of the parked car suggests it is stationary, and due to the viewing angle, it is unclear whether the driver-side door is open or closed. The reflection on the side of the car indicates a glossy finish. For the ego car, this parked car narrows the usable roadway and requires the driver to be vigilant of potential movement from the parked vehicle, such as opening doors or the car pulling out into traffic.",
