        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a notable presence of a white bus parked by the roadside, which slightly extends into the lane. This particular positioning of the bus necessitates cautious driving from the autonomous vehicle, including potential adjustments in speed or lane changes. The reason for this caution is twofold: firstly, the bus might re-enter the traffic lane, and secondly, the bus's location could lead to passengers embarking or disembarking, thereby creating obstacles and affecting the flow of traffic. Given the bus's size and position, it significantly influences possible driving routes, making it essential to monitor any movements closely and maintain a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, the image features a low concrete barrier situated on the right side, serving to separate the road from an elevated pedestrian walkway. While this barrier does not directly pose a risk to the autonomous vehicle, it restricts the vehicle's ability to maneuver to the right of the white truck, thereby limiting its navigational options.\n\nAnother element present in the image is a pedestrian overpass located in the upper left corner. This structure indicates a potential area where pedestrians might appear. Although the current view does not show any pedestrians, the proximity to pedestrian facilities suggests that the autonomous vehicle should remain vigilant of possible pedestrian movements, ensuring safety and preparedness for any sudden appearances.\n\nIn summary, the traffic image presents a scenario where a parked bus and a concrete barrier directly influence the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior, necessitating cautious navigation and constant monitoring of the surroundings. Additionally, the presence of a pedestrian overpass calls for heightened awareness of potential pedestrian activity, even if none is currently visible."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from a parked bus, be prepared to slow down or stop to prevent the bus from entering the traffic lane, and check adjacent lanes to ensure safe overtaking when necessary. Exercise caution to avoid sudden movements from the parked bus or van. Always be aware of any unexpected actions from parked vehicles and anticipate the presence of pedestrians, especially around buses. Given the current road conditions, the best course of action for your vehicle is to approach the stationary bus carefully, ensuring a safe distance. Your vehicle should not attempt to overtake the bus from the left side unless it is confirmed that there are no oncoming vehicles or pedestrians and that it can be done safely. Proceed only when the lane is clear, and continue to stay alert for pedestrians near pedestrian overpasses and parked vehicles.",
