There is a truck on the left-hand side of the frame with a blue container, which occupies the lane next to the ego car, necessitating caution during lane changes due to its close proximity. Additionally, a fire engine in the right-hand lane, identifiable by its red and white color scheme and emergency lights, requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for the fire engine's potential emergency maneuvers.\n\nFurthermore, a stationary or slowly moving dark-colored truck on the left shoulder, encroaching onto the left lane, may prompt the ego car to shift lanes to continue safely. There's also a compact car situated in the middle lane, ahead of the ego car; it seems to be traveling at a constant speed, but the ego car should remain vigilant for any sudden changes in this vehicle's speed or trajectory.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image, it is important to note that green traffic lights are observable in the distance on the highway, signaling that the vehicles may keep proceeding and there is currently no need for the ego car to prepare for stopping."

It often moves slower than regular traffic. The presence of such a vehicle may indicate nearby construction activity. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or reduced speed ahead. The vehicle may also make wide turns or sudden movements, so caution and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary are advised to safely navigate around it.",

Be prepared to reduce speed or change lanes if the emergency vehicle maneuvers or if there is any obstacle ahead not visible currently due to the large vehicles in front. Stay alert for possible traffic signs or signals which may be obscured by the traffic. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead on the right and monitor the emergency vehicle ahead in the left lane for any sudden stops or lane changes it might make. Be prepared to change lanes if the situation with the stationary truck on the left escalates or if the emergency situation in the left lane requires it. Adhere to the speed limit and follow the traffic rules as indicated by the current green traffic lights."
