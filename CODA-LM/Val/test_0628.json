Furthermore, the truck may make unexpected stops or turns as part of its operation."

        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are two vehicles noted. The first is a large construction vehicle with a concrete pump mechanism that extends over its cab; it is located directly in front of the ego car and occupies the same lane. This vehicle is expected to move slowly, requiring the ego car to maintain a greater following distance for safety. There is a risk of road debris or obstructions because of the vehicle's concrete operations. The truck may also stop or turn unexpectedly as part of its work. The second vehicle is a flatbed truck in the lane to the right and slightly ahead of the ego car. This truck could block the ego car driver's view of that side, possibly concealing other road users or traffic signals, and requires vigilance, especially if the ego car intends to change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue directional traffic sign visible at the top right, which indicates a split in the road ahead with directions for drivers. While this sign does not immediately affect the driving behavior of the ego car, it provides important information for upcoming navigation decisions.\n\nThere are no other road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this traffic image that require attention."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle with a rotating drum, commonly known as a cement mixer truck. This heavy equipment vehicle is designed to mix concrete during transport to construction sites. While driving behind this vehicle, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance to allow for a longer stopping distance and to react to any potential debris falling from the mixer. Its size and weight affect its acceleration and deceleration dynamics, which in turn require the following driver to adjust speed and following space accordingly.",

The truck has a flat platform with wooden planks and metal frames. Since this type of truck often carries oversized cargo, the ego car should be cautious and give extra space in case any part of the cargo is wider than the truck itself or if there's a risk of items shifting or falling off.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance behind the construction vehicle to allow for adequate reaction time. Be attentive to the vehicle's indicators or brake lights for any sudden stops or turns. Prepare for a navigation decision based on the directional signage without lane change due to the heavy vehicle occupying the current lane. Additionally, keep an eye on the road signs for navigational purposes but prioritize safe driving distance and attentiveness to the truck's actions. Due to the slow-moving construction vehicle in front, the ego car should consider changing lanes to the right to bypass it. However, it should do so with caution, signaling appropriately and checking mirrors and blind spots for other traffic, especially given the presence of the flatbed truck. No immediate turning maneuvers seem to be required unless dictated by the route, in which case the car should prepare to follow the directional signs. Maintaining a safe following distance from the construction vehicle is recommended until a safe lane change can be executed."
