        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a large truck that is occupying the full width of the lane directly in front of our vehicle. The truck's taillights are lit, signaling that it is in the process of slowing down or has come to a stop. The presence of the truck is important for the autonomous driving system to consider because its large size can obstruct the view of the road ahead. Additionally, the activated brake lights indicate that the autonomous vehicle needs to be ready to slow down or stop accordingly. Therefore, the system must ensure that it maintains a safe following distance from the truck and be alert for any potential changes in speed or sudden stops. There are no other road users, signs, lights, cones, barriers, or objects in the image that impact driving behavior, as those categories have been left empty in the data provided."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, be ready to stop or slow down at any moment, and pay attention to changes in the truck's brake lights, which may indicate a change in speed. Use low beam headlights to ensure not to dazzle other road users while illuminating the road ahead. The driving speed should ensure that stopping safely is possible within the area illuminated by the headlights. Moreover, due to wet roads, the vehicle should reduce speed to ensure sufficient stopping distance and prevent skidding. Be prepared to respond to the truck's potential stops or slowdowns. Monitor the truck's signal lights, be aware of any intentions to turn or change lanes, and be ready to react accordingly.",

Its presence on the road requires maintaining a safe distance to avoid collisions, particularly because such vehicles may have longer stopping distances and limited visibility for the driver. The ego car should follow at a safe distance, be cautious when overtaking, and be prepared for the truck's potential slow maneuverability.",
