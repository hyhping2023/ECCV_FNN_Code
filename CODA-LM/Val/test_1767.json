        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, there is a white hatchback parked on the right side of the road with its trunk lid open, and a person standing beside it, partially blocking the lane. This indicates that the vehicle may be in the process of loading or unloading goods, and the presence of the individual suggests there could be activity around the vehicle, potentially leading to obstruction and posing a danger to other road users.\n\nAdditionally, a person is walking in the same direction as the vehicle on the right side, close to where the parked vehicles are situated, which means they are near the lane of the autonomous car. The proximity of pedestrians to the vehicle lane mandates vigilance to anticipate any potential changes in their direction or position that could be hazardous.\n\nA small white dog is also present on the road, positioned ahead to the right of the pedestrians. Animals, particularly dogs, may exhibit unpredictable behavior and there's a risk of it entering the lane of vehicle traffic. Constant monitoring of the dog is crucial to react promptly should it move into the path of oncoming vehicles."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the potential movement of pedestrians, hatchbacks with their trunks open, and dogs, the vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Vehicles should carefully navigate around hatchbacks and tricycles, ensuring not to endanger pedestrians or startle dogs, and to safely pass through roads narrowed by parked vehicles. Moreover, due to wet roads and the presence of debris, the vehicle should increase the following distance and be prepared for a longer braking distance.",
