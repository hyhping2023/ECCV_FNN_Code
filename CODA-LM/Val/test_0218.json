This SUV sets the immediate speed and following distance required for the ego vehicle. Ahead of the SUV, there are multiple vehicles within the same lane, all proceeding in the same direction, which contribute to the overall pace of the traffic and any potential changes in flow that the ego vehicle must adapt to. Alongside these, in the left lane, there are various other vehicles moving in parallel with the ego car. These vehicles necessitate careful monitoring by the ego vehicle to safely predict and react to any possible lane changes.\n\nThe traffic scene is devoid of any vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, which suggests there are no immediate actions required for the ego vehicle in this regard. Likewise, there are no traffic signs or traffic lights within the field of view that would demand attention or carry an impact on the driving behavior at this moment.\n\nHowever, there are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the ego car's lane, which guide the traffic away from the sidewalk. The presence of these cones requires the ego vehicle to carefully navigate the constrained lane space to avoid them while staying within lane markers. No barriers or other objects, such as debris or dustbins, are present that would affect the driving path or necessitate evasive maneuvers by the ego car. The path ahead, therefore, appears to be free from any small unexpected obstacles."

It is often used during road work or accidents to indicate areas that are off-limits to vehicles, or to funnel traffic into specific lanes. For the ego car, the presence of the cone indicates that there may be obstructions ahead, or lanes may be merging. It's a signal for the driver to proceed with caution, potentially reduce speed, and be prepared to alter their path to avoid the indicated obstacle.",

Stay alert for any changes in the traffic ahead to react appropriately to braking or changes in speed. Since there are traffic cones present, the ego car should also ensure it remains within the reduced lane space, focusing on the lane ahead without veering towards the cones. Continuous monitoring of the surrounding vehicles' behavior is also necessary to anticipate and react to potential traffic flow changes. Be prepared to adjust speed according to the flow of traffic and be vigilant of other vehicles in the left lane that may affect the ego car's ability to change lanes. Lane change may be required if the lane closure ahead persists beyond the field of view. Monitor surroundings continuously for unexpected road users or changes in traffic patterns. Given the parked vehicle in the ego lane and the alignment of traffic cones suggesting a lane restriction, the ego car should prepare to change lanes to the left, if it is safe to do so. The vehicle should check for the presence and speed of vehicles in the adjacent lane and signal appropriately before making the maneuver. Maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and being prepared to adjust speed to match the flow of traffic is also advised."
