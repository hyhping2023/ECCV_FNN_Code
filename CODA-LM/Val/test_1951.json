        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are multiple road users and elements that are influencing the driving environment. Firstly, there are parked cars on the right side of the road within a designated parking area with marked lines. These distinct vehicles pose a risk as there's a possibility of one of them pulling out unexpectedly or doors opening. Therefore, it is advised that the ego vehicle maintain a safe distance from these stationary cars. \n\nAdditionally, there is another vehicle in the oncoming traffic, situated on the opposite side of the road and distant, within its lane's center. This vehicle is not a direct immediate risk to the ego vehicle's path, but it is important to keep an eye on its movements, particularly if it makes a turn or if there are any obstructions that might alter its course.\n\nConcerning the road signs, a no parking sign is visible on the right side of the road followed by a circular sign featuring the number '6', which is probably indicating a speed limit or another traffic regulation that must be observed. The ego vehicle should take note that stopping or parking may not be allowed along the road, except possibly in the designated parking zones. Furthermore, there is a speed limit sign placed on the left side of the road which indicates a maximum speed of '60'. This speed limit should be adhered to by the ego vehicle.\n\nAs for the traffic signals, there is a traffic light showing green ahead, situated above the central road divider. The green light bestows the right of way upon the ego vehicle to continue through the upcoming intersection or to carry on along the road if the light is managing the current lane.\n\nLastly, yellow street barriers have been installed in the road's center, resulting in a divide between the traffic lanes. These barriers imply that there might be a constriction or a split in the road ahead, prompting the necessity for the ego vehicle to potentially adjust its positioning within its lane to accommodate the changes in the road's layout. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects have been noted in the image, indicating that there are no such elements affecting the driving conditions for the ego vehicle in the current scenario."

Be prepared to adjust lane positioning due to the yellow barriers ahead. Monitor the tail lights of the cars ahead for any abrupt stops or changes in traffic flow. Drive at a reduced speed suitable for potentially slippery road conditions. Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles, be prepared for any of them to pull out or open doors. Adhere to the 60 km/h speed limit, and be alert for the potential need to change lanes due to the temporary barriers ahead. Proceed through the intersection with caution, as the green light is currently active, but watch for any changes and cross traffic."
