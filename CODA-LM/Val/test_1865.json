This car may adjust its speed or change lanes, indicating that traffic ahead is slowing down or stopping due to an overturned truck.\n  - A green public transit bus is in the center lane ahead, with a dynamic information sign displaying service status. Buses may stop frequently, necessitating overtaking or adjusting speed, and the overall traffic flow suggests a potential reduction in speed.\n  - An orange road maintenance vehicle is on the right, moving in the same direction as our car. This vehicle's presence suggests maintenance activities are taking place nearby, though it is unlikely to directly affect the self-driving car.\n  - There are various other vehicles around, each maintaining their own lane and distance, reacting to the flow of traffic, and potentially changing lanes.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: \n  - An overhead sign spanning multiple lanes displays directions for merging and route planning. These signs help guide the vehicle in choosing lanes to perform the planned actions and continue on the route.\n\n- **Barriers**: \n  - A portable blue traffic barrier has fallen on the left side of the road, possibly due to a truck accident. This barrier serves as a warning of potential road obstacles ahead and indicates a reduction in the width of available lanes."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead. Due to traffic congestion, be prepared to slow down or stop. Pay attention to the green bus and be ready to maneuver around the blue sign on the road. Due to the unpredictable reactions of other road users to accidents, it is advisable to drive cautiously. Use turn signals when changing lanes and always watch for other vehicles that may suddenly change lanes. If an accident blocks the planned route, a detour may be necessary.",
