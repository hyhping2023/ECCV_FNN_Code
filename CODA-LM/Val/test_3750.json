The first is a green truck with its headlights on, positioned on the right side of the road and facing the ego car. This truck appears to be engaged in construction work or unloading material. Its location and orientation may block part of the lane and reduce visibility for the ego car, and the bright headlights could cause glare, impacting the driver's ability to see clearly. The second vehicle is a construction vehicle with a load on its back, indicating it is likely involved in transportation or construction activities. This suggests there could be unexpected movements or debris falling onto the road, which means the ego car must proceed with extra caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image. Additionally, no traffic lights are visible, which implies that the ego vehicle should adhere to the standard road rules in the absence of specific traffic control devices."

It is situated directly ahead of the ego vehicle and has its headlights on. Due to its position on the road, the ego vehicle must either slow down or change lanes to avoid a collision. The presence of this tricycle indicates that the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, especially if visibility is poor or if the tricycle is moving slower than the rest of the traffic.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should reduce speed to account for the reduced traction on the possibly slick road surface and to allow for a safe reaction time considering the visibility condition. Additionally, the ego car should prepare to change lanes or navigate around the truck if required, using caution if the truck's activity involves people or other obstacles that might suddenly appear in the roadway. Proceed slowly and maintain a vigilant watch for any movement or lights from the utility vehicle indicating it might enter traffic flow. Since visibility is poor and there are no visible traffic control signals, the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or maneuver around the utility vehicle if it remains stationary. Use low beams to avoid glare and ensure maximum visibility without blinding other road users. Given the presence of the stationary construction vehicle and wet road conditions, the ego car should reduce its speed and proceed with caution. The headlights and potential for merging action from the construction vehicle require readiness to stop or yield. Additionally, the ego car should increase its following distance to account for decreased visibility and traction, considering the weather and lighting conditions indicated by the image."
