        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of notable road users and structures that are influencing the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Directly ahead, there is a large truck with hazard marking plates, which is characterized by red and white diagonally striped boards. This truck is significant as it is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and seems to be either stationary or moving at a slow pace, necessitating careful path planning for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a sedan is observed in the lane to the right, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. The presence of this sedan is crucial as it affects the ego vehicle's ability to safely change lanes to the right. The ego vehicle must keep an eye on this sedan to assess its speed and ensure it maintains its lane.\n\nOn the right side of the scene, concrete barriers are present. These barriers are important as they define the lane structure and limit the maneuverability of the ego vehicle, particularly in terms of providing limited options to avoid obstacles or incidents that may occur ahead on the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving decisions of the ego vehicle."

This vehicle may be involved in road maintenance or construction work. Due to its size and purpose, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slower movements. The presence of such a vehicle also indicates the possibility of a construction zone ahead, where extra caution and adherence to reduced speed limits are required.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the limited visibility and presence of a large truck in the same lane, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance in case the truck stops suddenly. The ego car should also monitor the speed and trajectory of the sedan to the right to assess if a lane change is possible and safe. The ego vehicle should also prepare to stop or reduce speed, adhering to the behavior of the truck and observing the brake lights of vehicles ahead to react appropriately to any changes. Given that overtaking does not seem feasible at this moment due to the adjacent vehicle and concrete barriers, caution is advised, with a focus on defensive driving."
