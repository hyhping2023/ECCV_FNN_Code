Additionally, white protective fences are installed on both sides of the road, creating a physical barrier between the pedestrian walkways and the vehicle lanes, with a median strip separating the traffic moving in opposite directions. These barriers guide vehicles to the appropriate lane positions and alert drivers to the narrow road space, influencing lane discipline and speed.
