        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is one large truck ahead on the same lane, which has yellow and black stripes and is carrying construction machinery. The truck is large enough to occupy the full width of the lane. Due to its size and position, the truck impacts the driving behavior of the ego car by affecting visibility and limiting available space to maneuver. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance in response to the truck's presence since it poses a risk of making sudden stops or turns, may move slower, and could take longer to react to traffic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a slanted white traffic sign on the left side of the road, which is partially covered by a tree. The obstructed sign suggests that there could be important changes in road conditions or regulations, hence the driver should remain alert and be prepared to comply with the sign's instruction, once it becomes visible.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Stay alert for any changes in the truck's movements or any indications that it may be turning or stopping. The ego car should monitor the partially visible traffic sign as it approaches, preparing to adjust speed or lane position according to the sign's instruction once it is clearly visible. Overtaking should only be considered if it can be accomplished safely with a clear view of the oncoming lane, which currently is not available due to the truck's size. Otherwise, continue following the truck at a safe distance and speed appropriate for the current road conditions."
