The presence of the van requires the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there are multiple parked cars on the right-hand side of the road, including a black car that is partially obstructing the lane. These parked cars necessitate cautious driving from the ego car, as they could potentially hide pedestrians or opening car doors.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, there is a cyclist moving in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's presence means the ego car must be vigilant and ensure a safe passing distance, as cyclists can change direction or position unexpectedly.\n\nThe lane is narrowed by yellow and red striped traffic cones on both sides, indicating a construction zone. These cones signal the need for the ego car to reduce speed and exercise increased caution due to the reduced lane width and potential construction-related hazards.\n\nAlong the left side of the road, there is a line of tall, red barriers with yellow and black directional arrows, marking the border of a construction site. These barriers instruct the ego car to stay to the right and be alert for any construction activity or vehicles that might enter the roadway.\n\nOther urban elements such as street signs, lampposts, and a pedestrian crossing zone are also present in the scene. However, these do not have a direct impact on the ego vehicle's driving path at the moment and therefore do not require any immediate action from the ego car."
