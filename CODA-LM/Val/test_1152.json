A large beige bus is on the left side, partially sharing the lane with the ego car, suggesting it might be merging or maneuvering, which requires the ego car to be cautious and possibly adjust its speed or yield. Several cars are visible ahead, with one crossing the intersection, another turning right, and a third approaching the ego car, indicating potential crossing traffic that could affect the right of way. A light-colored sedan is slightly ahead in an adjacent lane to the left, which may influence the ego car's lane choice and overtaking decisions. There is also a red public bus traveling in the same direction ahead in the left lane, which could affect the ego car's speed and following distance due to potential stops. On the right side of the road, a blue bus is stopped and facing the opposite direction, which could hide pedestrians or vehicles that may cross or enter the road, requiring extra caution. Multiple cars are driving in the same direction ahead, with one white car changing lanes to the right, necessitating awareness and distance maintenance from the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image. A billboard is visible on the right, but it does not provide traffic instructions, so while it doesn't directly impact driving behavior, the ego car should still maintain environmental awareness. There are no traffic lights to govern the intersection or flow around the construction area, meaning the ego car must rely on road rules and mutual yielding.\n\nTraffic cones are set up along the right side of the road, leading up to and around a pile of rubble, signaling a reduction in drivable road width and requiring the ego car to steer left to avoid the coned-off area. A pile of debris is also present on the right side by the work zone, indicating ongoing construction and necessitating slow speeds and increased vigilance. Additionally, construction material and possible waste are on the right side of the road near the debris, with some materials partially intruding into the lane, representing a hazard that could become more dangerous if they move further into the lane or are disturbed by traffic. Construction piles and debris also suggest the presence of construction vehicles or workers, which could affect traffic flow and require vigilance from the ego car."

Furthermore, the driver should be vigilant for crossing traffic at the upcoming intersection since there are no traffic control signals visible. Maintaining a lower speed will give the ego car time to respond to the dynamic situation."
