There is a parked white van on the right side of the ego car, partially obstructing the driving lane, which may necessitate merging left into the adjacent lane to safely pass. Additionally, several vehicles are parked on the right side of the road, potentially narrowing the driving space and causing the ego car to reduce speed and drive cautiously. Oncoming traffic is visible in the distance with headlights on, indicating low visibility conditions, requiring the ego car to be prepared for reduced visibility and potential glare. A black car is parked on the right before the white van, with its tail lights on, signaling that the area has vehicles parked on the side of the road, mandating caution due to potential doors opening or pedestrians near these vehicles. Finally, a traffic signal ahead displays a red light above the center of the roadway, requiring the ego vehicle to prepare to stop unless the signal changes to green before reaching the intersection."
