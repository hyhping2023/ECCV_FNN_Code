The ego car should monitor these cars for any signs of movement or door opening. These vehicles reduce the usable width of the lane and may mask the presence of pedestrians or other hazards.

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, there are parked cars on the right side of the road without any visible activity around them. These parked cars require cautious monitoring by the autonomous vehicle as they pose several risks; for instance, there is a chance a door could open into oncoming traffic or one of the vehicles could pull out unexpectedly. Additionally, these cars limit the available width of the lane for passing traffic and may conceal pedestrians or other hazards from view. On the right sidewalk, there is an unattended bicycle leaning against a bench. Although it does not currently obstruct the vehicle's path, it signals the likelihood of pedestrian or cyclist activity in the vicinity and should be considered by the autonomous vehicle's systems to anticipate and react to potential dynamic changes in the environment. There is no mention of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the scene, indicating an absence of these elements in the image."

Additionally, the unattended bicycle should be noted, and the ego car should be prepared to react in case of unexpected pedestrian or cyclist activity. Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles to avoid any sudden obstructions. Maintain a moderate speed, observing the speed limit and ensuring you have enough reaction time if a pedestrian emerges from behind the parked cars. Keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles to avoid any potential doors opening into your path. Watch for any unexpected movements from the sides of the road, such as a cyclist beginning to pedal or a pedestrian stepping out from between vehicles. Continue to monitor the road's state for any changes or obstacles."
