        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, a white cement mixer is slightly ahead of our vehicle in the far-left lane, advancing forward and partially encroaching into the middle lane. The size and position of this truck could potentially block the view of oncoming hazards and may necessitate altering the driving path or increasing following distance to allow for safe maneuvering. Additionally, farther across the intersection, a stationary white car is observed facing away, prompting adjustments in speed and potential preparation for braking or steering responses.\n\nOn the right roadside, there are two traffic signs visible. One sign displays a 60 kilometers per hour speed limit, which drivers are expected to adhere to once past the intersection. Adjacent to it, a \"No Honking\" sign is also present, indicating that honking is prohibited in the area, particularly at the intersection.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there's a green light for making a left turn and a red light for going straight at the light directly ahead of our vehicle. This indicates the need to stop at the intersection, follow the red signal, and only proceed with a left turn as the green light directs. Meanwhile, another traffic light set facing the opposite direction displays a red light, suggesting stopped traffic in that lane. Although it does not directly impact our vehicle's actions, it's crucial for overall situational awareness.\n\nOn the right side, a metal fence delineates the boundary between the road and adjacent property, ensuring that both vehicles and pedestrians from the adjacent buildings do not inadvertently enter the roadway, thereby defining road usage and contributing to safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to a red light ahead for straight travel, this vehicle should prepare to stop if intending to go straight. Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck partially occupying the middle lane, and adjust lane selection accordingly. When the green light appears and it is safe to proceed, comply with the 60 km/h speed limit. Pay attention to changes in traffic lights at the intersection and movements of other vehicles. Stay within the marked lane and do not cross the separation barriers into the pedestrian area.",
