Firstly, there is a green truck on the left side, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The size and position of the truck are significant because it demands space and may block the view of other road users. Additionally, there is a black car ahead in the same lane as the ego car, also moving in the same direction. This car is important as it sets the driving speed and following distance for the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, there are construction workers present on the road median and on the right side beyond the traffic cones. Their presence near the roadway could impact the flow of traffic and may cause other vehicles to stop suddenly or change lanes unexpectedly.\n\nThe road also features traffic cones on both sides, indicating a construction zone and a narrowing of the lanes. These cones are directing the traffic flow and suggest that drivers should proceed with caution and possibly at a reduced speed due to the decreased lane width.\n\nLastly, barriers are placed on the right side beside the construction area, extending into the road shoulder. These barriers lead to a narrower road, necessitating that the ego car maintains its lane position with care.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."
