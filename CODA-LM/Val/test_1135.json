Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the right lane ahead, which may influence our car's speed and lane choice. Additionally, a dark-colored SUV is driving ahead in the same lane as our car, just passing the white sedan, and its driving behavior will affect our vehicle's speed and the distance we maintain from it.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the left of our car, there is a pedestrian walking close to the road. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, we must remain cautious as they could potentially step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nA traffic sign indicating a pedestrian crossing is visible on the right side of the road ahead. This sign alerts drivers that pedestrians might cross the road, and we should be ready to yield to them.\n\nLastly, there is a dog sitting on the sidewalk on the right side. The dog is not on the road but is near the curb, so we need to keep an eye on it to prevent it from inadvertently entering the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a proper following distance behind the dark-colored SUV ahead, be prepared to stop or yield at the pedestrian crossing, and stay alert for any unforeseen movements of motorcyclists and pet dogs that may enter the roadway. Exercise caution when passing the parked white sedan on the right, ensuring a safe interval. Keep a prudent speed, monitor for any movements of the parked white car, and pay close attention to the motorcyclists, pedestrians, and dogs on the left. Be ready to stop or slow down if pedestrians, motorcyclists, or dogs start moving onto the road. Continue driving while adhering to standard traffic rules and being mindful of surrounding traffic. Drive carefully, maintaining a moderate speed to quickly respond to pedestrians, dogs, and parked vehicles that may enter the traffic flow. Do not speed and be ready to take evasive action if pedestrians or dogs enter the roadway, or if vehicles with hazard warning lights or motorcyclists move into the traffic stream.",
