Due to the van's position and movement, it influences the driving behavior of the ego car, which needs to maintain a safe following distance and adjust speed accordingly to respond to any potential changes in the van's actions.\n\nAlongside, there are orange traffic cones arranged on the right side of the road delineating the border between the active lane and a section undergoing construction or maintenance. These cones serve as a guide for the ego car to remain in the current lane and prevent unintentional entry into the coned-off area.\n\nAdditionally, a solid, continuous barrier is present on the right, extending alongside the traffic cones. It serves to emphasize the separation of the construction zone from the active lane, ensuring vehicles stay clear of the restricted area for safety reasons. The presence of this barrier demands the attention of the ego car to adhere to lane discipline and avoid the construction space.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that would necessitate additional consideration for the driving strategy of the ego car."
