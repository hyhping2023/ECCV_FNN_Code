A yellow construction vehicle is positioned directly in the line of the ego car, at the intersection, affecting the driving behavior as it may move unpredictably and is large in size. Alongside this, other cars are present in the neighboring lanes on the right, with a black sedan standing out next to the construction vehicle, indicating that the ego car has limited lateral movement options. Additionally, there are cars on the opposite side of the road, which are not currently interfering with the ego car's trajectory, but caution is advised due to their perpendicular motion.\n\nA cyclist is also part of the scene, located on the far right, traveling in the same direction as traffic. The cyclist's potential for unexpected swerving demands attention from the ego car. Moreover, the traffic signs in view include a No Left Turn sign on the left, which prohibits such movements at the intersection, and a blue directional sign on the right that could carry important navigation instructions for the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, traffic lights situated ahead are displaying a red signal for all lanes, requiring the ego car and other traffic to come to a halt and wait for a change to green. There are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in the image, so these categories do not contribute to the current traffic situation."

The vehicle's position on the road indicates ongoing or upcoming construction or maintenance work. Due to its larger size and reduced maneuverability, the ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for unexpected stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle, and exhibit heightened awareness for potential roadwork or obstacles ahead.

Awareness of traffic signs is essential, and the No Left Turn sign restricts turning maneuvers. Adjust speed and positioning to anticipate potential actions from the road users around. The ego car should also prepare for vehicles on the opposite side once the light turns green, as they may cross the intersection or turn."
