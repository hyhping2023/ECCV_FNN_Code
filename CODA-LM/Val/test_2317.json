        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects to consider. Vehicles include oncoming traffic on the opposite side of the road with their headlights on, which requires the self-driving car to monitor and adapt to their driving behaviors. Additionally, there is a large vehicle—possibly a truck or bus—ahead on the right side with its taillights on, suggesting it may be moving slowly or is docked, which could impact available lane space.\n\nOn the right side of the road, barriers present an obstacle that is partially obstructing the lane, necessitating an adjustment in the vehicle's position to accommodate the reduced navigable space. Moreover, a red barrier ahead on the right side indicates potential construction or a closed-off area and a consequent reduction in lane width or driving path.\n\nFinally, visibility is impacted by strong reflections and glare from streetlights and oncoming headlights, which demands increased caution from the self-driving car's sensing systems. This is due to the possibility of obscured pedestrians, obstacles, or other road users.\n\nNotably, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the red light ahead and vehicles proceeding straight, this vehicle should come to a complete stop at the traffic signal and maintain a safe distance from the car in front. It is necessary to monitor oncoming traffic to enhance situational awareness, although yielding is not required since the opposing vehicles are on the other side of the road. This vehicle must also take into account the wet and slippery road surface, anticipate a longer stopping distance, and engage in cautious driving behavior. Due to reduced visibility and wet roads, please drive carefully. If the road ahead is clear and a right turn is intended, this vehicle may slowly execute the turn while monitoring for potential hazards. If continuing straight, this vehicle should wait for the red light to turn green and watch for any changes around large vehicles that are stationary or moving slowly on the right. Be prepared to maneuver around obstacles that enter the driving lane. At the same time, if an obstacle blocks the current lane, be ready to possibly change lanes and turn on the low-beam headlights to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers. Pay attention to any sudden changes in the vehicles ahead or traffic lights. This vehicle must wait for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding.",
