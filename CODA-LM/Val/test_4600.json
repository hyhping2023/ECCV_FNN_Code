The van's location may lead other vehicles to merge into the path of the ego vehicle to go around it, thereby increasing the possibility of a collision. Additionally, several vehicles are observed in the distance, sharing the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles will likely influence the overall pace of traffic and can affect maneuvering decisions. A blue car is present in the left lane going in the opposite direction to the ego vehicle, and along with other cars on the road, it represents a dynamic obstacle that must be monitored for unexpected actions.\n\nRegarding non-vehicular traffic, a cyclist is present ahead on the right, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This cyclist necessitates extra caution and a safe following distance due to potential sudden movements. Pedestrians are spotted near the stopped van, and they may unpredictably enter the traffic lane, posing a safety risk.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the view, which requires the ego vehicle to navigate based on road signs and general traffic rules. There are no discernible traffic cones or barriers in the image.\n\nAdditionally, there's a handcart placed partially on the road by the parked van, hinting at temporary unloading where individuals may suddenly come into the roadway. The presence of this object can lead to risks that need to be factored in while driving past the van and handcart.\n\nAll these road users and objects need to be taken into account for safe and efficient navigation by the autonomous system of the ego vehicle."
