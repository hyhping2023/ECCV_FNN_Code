On the right side of the road, a white sedan is parked with its rear red lights illuminated, indicating it has stopped or is parked. This vehicle reduces usable road space and suggests possible nearby activities that could affect road conditions. Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked further ahead on the right, increasing the driving complexity by limiting available space and potentially obstructing views of hidden hazards such as pedestrians.\n\nA pedestrian is also seen on the right side of the image, approaching the parking area, suggesting they might cross the road. The vehicle should be prepared to slow down and stop if this occurs.\n\nTraffic barriers and cones are also present on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the street area, likely indicating road construction or temporary hazards. This necessitates cautious driving and potential adjustments within the lane.\n\nLastly, the road surface exhibits light reflections and glare from oncoming traffic or other light sources. These glares could distract drivers or obscure road hazards and other road users."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the limited visibility and wet, slippery road conditions, the vehicle should proceed slowly, reduce speed to ensure sufficient braking distance, and be ready to stop at any time for pedestrians or to accommodate vehicles parked on the right side of the road. Approach parking areas with caution, maintaining a safe following distance, and stay vigilant for additional hazards that may arise due to reduced visibility and increased complexity of the driving environment. Pay attention to other road users who may be difficult to see at night, and continuously monitor for any obstacles and potential updates to road conditions.",
