The truck is occupying what appears to be part of the intended path of travel. It is nighttime, which reduces visibility, and while the truck’s side lights are reflective, they are dim, indicating that the truck might be stationary or moving slowly. This truck's position and size could obstruct the ego vehicle’s path and limit visibility ahead. This necessitates either a change in the ego vehicle’s trajectory or a complete stop to ensure safety, as the truck poses a significant obstruction and a hazardous situation due to the low visibility and potential for sudden stops."

The presence of this vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating caution and awareness of potential movement. It may require the ego car to slow down and pass the truck carefully to avoid any unexpected obstacles or the possibility of the truck entering the roadway.",

Since it is a night scene with limited visibility, the ego vehicle should use its high beam headlights to better assess the truck's position and movement. If the truck is moving, maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for it to make wide turns. If it is stationary, look for any possible signs of roadwork or indications that it may be turning soon. The ego car should not attempt to overtake until certain the opposite lane is clear and it is safe to do so. Additionally, continuously monitor the surroundings for any other road users that might be concealed by the size of the truck. The vehicle should activate its hazard lights to alert other road users of its intent to navigate around the obstruction and proceed with caution, ensuring there is no oncoming traffic and that it is safe to bypass the truck."
