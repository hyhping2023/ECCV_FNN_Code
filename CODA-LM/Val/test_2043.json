        "description and explanation": "In the observed image, there are various road users and objects, categorized as follows:\n\nVehicles:\nThere is a blue car in the same lane ahead of our vehicle, moving in the same direction at a moderate distance. It is essential to keep a safe following distance and adjust the speed of our vehicle accordingly, considering that the blue car's activities could directly influence our driving strategy. Our vehicle needs to remain alert for any abrupt changes in speed or direction from the blue car.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\nAn adult male pedestrian is notable for walking near parked cars on the street. Carrying a plastic bag, this individual is headed toward the right side of the image. The pedestrianâ€™s choice to walk on the road rather than the sidewalk can be a potential hazard. The autonomous vehicle must monitor his movements carefully since an unexpected entry into the traffic lane could pose a threat to safety.\n\nOther Objects:\nOn the right side of the street, scooters and an electric delivery bicycle with a cargo box have been parked, partially blocking the sidewalk. The consequence of these parked items is the narrowing of pedestrian space, possibly causing individuals to walk on the street, which requires additional attention from our autonomous vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, multiple objects, including trash bins and delivery boxes, are present on the right-hand sidewalk. These objects can conceal potential dangers, such as more scooters or pedestrians suddenly entering the street. As a result, an autonomous vehicle has to proceed with heightened caution in this area, being prepared for any unforeseen movements.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, so no actions or considerations related to these categories are necessary."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, maintain a low speed, and be prepared to stop at any moment in case pedestrians decide to cross the road or move further into the lane. If possible, slightly turn to the left while ensuring your vehicle stays within its own lane without crossing into the oncoming traffic lane, leaving ample space for pedestrians. Also, be aware of other vehicles that may pull out from parking spaces. Keep a safe distance from the blue car ahead, watching for any changes in its speed or direction. Stay alert for pedestrians on the right, ensuring they are not endangered by your vehicle's movements. Be prepared to make lateral evasive maneuvers within your lane to avoid motorcycle obstacles, while making sure your vehicle does not encroach on the opposite lane or collide with pedestrians. Drive cautiously and always be ready to respond to the sudden actions of pedestrians or other vehicles. The vehicle should also maintain a safe distance from the cars parked on the right to prevent accidents if car doors suddenly open or if there's movement. It is advised to closely monitor pedestrians and be prepared in case they step onto the road. In summary, in this urban environment with potential unpredictable elements, it is recommended to adopt a defensive driving strategy, being ready to stop or slow down at any time.",
