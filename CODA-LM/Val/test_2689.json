There are several vehicles situated around the ego car; ahead, the road is flanked by multiple vehicles parked on both sides, requiring the ego car to navigate a narrower space and remain vigilant for unexpected movements or doors opening suddenly. A white car on the left faces the ego car, and though it's not an immediate obstacle, it poses a potential risk if it were to become mobile or its doors were to open. Directly in front, in the same lane as the ego car, a white sedan is moving in the same direction, essentially setting the pace for the ego car's speed and following distance to ensure safe travel. A blue car is also present, driving towards the ego car in the opposite lane, part of normal traffic and not directly impacting the ego carâ€™s trajectory, unless it unexpectedly exits its lane.\n\nVulnerable road users are also in the vicinity, with a pedestrian crossing the road ahead on the ego car's side, commanding readiness to halt to permit safe passage. Additionally, there is a stray dog on the right side of the road, meandering towards the center of the lane, posing an immediate hazard; consequently, the ego car should be ready to decelerate or stop to avoid any potential collision.\n\nIn terms of signage, there is a pedestrian crossing sign positioned on the left, adjacent to the crosswalk, signaling a need for the ego car to drop speed and exercise increased vigilance.\n\nThe dataset contains no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that need to be taken into account in this traffic image."
