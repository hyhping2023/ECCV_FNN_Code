The size and load of the truck may limit the visibility for the ego car and necessitate an increased stopping distance. Considering the truck is positioned directly ahead, it is a primary point of interest for the ego vehicle. Additionally, there are several cars in the lanes to the left of the ego car; some of these are parallel, while others are slightly ahead or behind. These vehicles could potentially change lanes or adjust their speeds, affecting the driving decisions of the ego car. Furthermore, there is a white sedan to the right, slightly ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction as traffic, signifying its inclusion in the traffic flow and possible impact on the ego car's lane-changing decisions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are directional signs indicating lanes for going straight or turning right, which assist the ego vehicle in anticipating the layout of the upcoming intersection and in preparing for any necessary lane changes.\n\nThe intersection ahead is governed by traffic lights that are currently green for going straight. This allows the ego vehicle to legally proceed, but the driver must remain alert for potential changes in the signal.\n\nA median barrier is located on the left side of the road, separating the opposite directions of traffic. This barrier serves to guide the flow of traffic and clarifies that crossing over to the opposite lane is not allowed.\n\nThe traffic image does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects."

Monitor the cars in adjacent lanes for any indication of lane changing, be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary but only with clear space and proper signaling. Obey the traffic signals and be vigilant as the intersection approaches, and adjust speed for wet road conditions. Stay vigilant of the white sedan and watch for any vehicles that may react to the red turning signal. Decrease speed slightly to account for wet road conditions, and be prepared for longer braking distances. Continue to monitor the traffic lights and proceed while the signal is green, with caution and readiness to react to the traffic ahead and any unexpected lane changes from other drivers."
