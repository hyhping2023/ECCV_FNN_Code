This sign is easily recognizable by its red circle with a horizontal bar and denotes that vehicles are not allowed to proceed past the sign. Additionally, there are several orange traffic cones adorned with reflective white stripes, systematically placed to indicate a potential detour or an imminent lane closure. These cones serve as navigational aids to safely reroute vehicles around certain zones, which could be due to road work or temporary impediments. Complementing the traffic cones is a portable white barrier with orange reflective elements. This barrier is set up adjacent to the cones, signifying an extension of the temporary lane segregation, possibly highlighting construction zones or areas that vehicles must bypass for safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of a \"No Entry\" sign, vehicles must not drive towards the direction the sign is facing. The placement of traffic cones indicates a deviation path that vehicles should carefully follow. While maintaining a safe speed to respond to any sudden situations, be prepared to make a right turn in a controlled manner, obeying the mandatory turn signs and following the path outlined by the traffic cones. Drive carefully, adhering to the temporary lane divisions marked by traffic cones and barriers. Although currently there are no other road users or objects affecting immediate driving behavior, the vehicle should remain vigilant, watching for any other signs, signals, or changes in road conditions not shown in this image.",

Traffic cones are used to redirect traffic, indicate temporary traffic patterns, or mark off areas within a driving environment. It serves as a signal to drivers, including the driver of the ego car, to maneuver around the indicated space, often due to roadwork, hazards, or changes in the usual driving path. In this scenario, the ego car would need to adjust its path to avoid the cones and follow the altered traffic route, ensuring safety and adherence to the temporary driving conditions.",
