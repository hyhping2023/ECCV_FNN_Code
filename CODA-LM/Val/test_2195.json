There are also rectangular orange information signs warning of road work and lane shifts, alerting the ego car to upcoming changes in traffic patterns. Directional signs indicate an upcoming merge from the left, prompting the ego car to be ready for merging traffic.\n\nBright orange traffic cones are set up on the left side of the ego car's lane, signaling a lane taper for roadwork ahead, which means the ego car must merge to the right. Yellow and black temporary barriers are in place to separate the work zone from the ego car's lane, enforcing a no-entry zone and providing a physical boundary between the vehicle and the construction area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects mentioned in the data that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The driver or autonomous system should also be vigilant for any changes in the traffic pattern and ready to respond to any construction vehicles that might enter the roadway. Monitor the vehicles in the adjacent lane for any lane-changing opportunities while staying within the 40 km/h speed limit. Prepare for potential merge left depending on road work progress and stay alert for any changes in the road conditions due to the barriers. Maintain lane discipline and keep a vigilant lookout for any road workers or new road signs that might appear. Continue in its current lane, maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead, adhere to the speed limit of 40 km/h, and remain vigilant for merging traffic due to the indicated work zone on the left side. Overtake the blue truck with caution if necessary while complying with speed regulations. No immediate lane changes appear to be required, but the situation should be constantly reassessed for safety."
