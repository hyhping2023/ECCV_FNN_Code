This vehicle could potentially obstruct the lane or make unexpected movements, which requires caution. Additionally, a white tank-like truck is present in the same lane as the ego car, positioned in front of it and moving in the same direction. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from this truck. There is also a compact car directly in front of the ego car within the same lane, dictating the immediate speed and distance the ego car should maintain.\n\nRegarding road signs, there is a yellow overhead directional sign on the right, which may indicate upcoming road junctions or directions that could affect the traffic flow.\n\nOn the left side of the road, orange traffic cones have been set up, demarcating a section of the lane. These cones are likely in place due to road work or a lane closure and may cause vehicles to merge, altering the traffic flow.\n\nMetal barriers are also positioned on the left side of the road. These barriers serve to protect the pedestrian walkway and any work area from vehicles, resulting in a narrower usable road space for vehicles.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
