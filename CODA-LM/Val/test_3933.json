        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that are influencing the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Directly ahead, there is a large truck in the same lane that appears to be stationary or moving very slowly. The presence of this truck requires the autonomous vehicle to potentially slow down, stop, or consider a lane change when it's safe.\n\nOn the opposite lane, a white car is facing the camera, providing a clear view of its front. This car's position is important for determining right-of-way and ensuring that the autonomous vehicle does not mistakenly enter the opposing traffic lane.\n\nAdditionally, a silver sedan is traveling in the same direction to the left of the autonomous vehicle, but in a different lane. The proximity of the sedan necessitates careful monitoring to maintain safe lane discipline and to be prepared for any potential lateral movements the sedan might make.\n\nOn the left side of the autonomous vehicle's lane, red traffic cones are set up, starting near the vehicle and extending forward. These cones suggest the possibility of road construction or obstacles ahead, indicating that the vehicle should remain in its current lane and prepare to merge to the right if necessary.\n\nTo the right of the autonomous vehicle, there is a noticeable barrier placed behind the traffic cones, reinforcing the separation of the road. This barrier serves as a further indication that the vehicle should stay in its current lane while navigating the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, pay attention to whether the truck is moving, and be prepared to stop if necessary. Do not attempt to overtake the truck unless you have a clear view that there are no vehicles in the opposing lane. Continue to drive in your current lane, and pay attention to the traffic cones on the left, which may indicate roadwork ahead or lane closures. Your vehicle should monitor the movements of the silver sedan while maintaining its lane position. It is advisable to continuously observe the surrounding environment in order to respond to any changes in traffic conditions, such as the movements of vehicles or changes in the road construction areas.",
