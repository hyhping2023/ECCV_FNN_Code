On the right side of the road, a pedestrian is walking, facing the intersection and partially obscured by road facilities, which requires the autonomous vehicle to remain vigilant due to unpredictable pedestrian behavior.\n\nThere are several traffic signs present. A blue pedestrian crossing sign on the left alerts drivers to a crossing area ahead, requiring a reduction in speed and increased alertness. A blue parking sign with a white \"P\" on the right indicates a parking area, with an additional sign depicting an arrow pointing towards the parking direction, which is relevant if the vehicle is seeking a parking spot. Additionally, a blue circular traffic sign with a white arrow in the center mandates a right turn ahead, affecting the vehicle's route planning and steering.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, indicating a work area or road obstacles, and drivers should be prepared to respond to changes in road layout or sudden movements by road workers and pedestrians.\n\nOther objects in the scene include a portable blue cubicle, possibly a toilet, located to the right behind the pedestrian, overhead power lines scattered throughout, and a trash can and temporary structure on the right side of the road beyond the bicycle lane area. These objects are off the road and do not affect immediate driving decisions but are noted as fixed objects near the road.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the current situation, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, as it obstructs the view of the road and any potential hazards that may arise. It is advised to continually monitor pedestrians and cyclists, as they may suddenly change direction or unexpectedly enter the roadway. The presence of traffic cones and barriers on the right indicates the need for caution; this vehicle should be prepared for road work or lane closures, and comply with any temporary traffic signs or signals. Follow the instructions of the traffic signs, especially the mandatory right turn ahead, and be ready at all times to react to vehicles entering or exiting parking areas. Overall, vigilance should be heightened and there should be readiness to adapt to the driving environment.",
