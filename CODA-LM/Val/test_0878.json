The presence of these construction vehicles may indicate active work, possibly leading to lane restrictions, slower traffic, or sudden movements of construction equipment.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a cyclist is visible traveling in the same direction as the ego car on the side of the road. The cyclist's proximity to the driving lane necessitates caution from the ego vehicle to prevent any potential accidents.\n\nThere are brightly colored traffic cones set up in front of the construction area, leading into the ego car's lane. These cones signal changes in traffic patterns, such as lane merges or closures, requiring the ego car to adjust its path accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, temporary fencing and barriers are in place around the construction area under the overpass, separating the worksite from the road. These barriers indicate a controlled area, which might make the lane narrower and necessitate reduced speed."

The presence of this vehicle suggests that there might be construction work underway nearby. As a result, the ego car may need to proceed with caution, anticipate possible detours or road closures, and be vigilant for construction workers and additional construction machinery entering or exiting the roadway.",

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the cyclist's movements to ensure a safe distance is maintained. As no traffic signs or lights are visible, the ego car should stay alert for any on-site directional guidance or workers directing traffic. Proceed with caution, maintain a safe distance from the cyclist, be prepared to change lanes if the construction work encroaches into the driving lane, and adhere to posted signs or signals indicating changes in traffic patterns due to construction."
