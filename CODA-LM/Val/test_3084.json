Firstly, a pedestrian can be seen to the left side of the image. They are walking parallel to our lane but are separated from the flow of traffic by an obstacle. The presence of the pedestrian has a minor impact on the driving behavior as they are not on the road itself, yet it is important for the vehicle to continue monitoring them to anticipate any potential changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary barriers or fences installed on the left side of the road. This indicates that there are construction activities taking place, leading to the available lanes narrowing. As a result, the vehicle should adjust its position to ensure it remains centrally aligned within the confines of the reduced lane width to maintain safe passage through the construction area. \n\nNo other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects are reported in the scene that would affect driving behavior."
