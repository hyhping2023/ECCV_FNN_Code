These cones indicate the approach to a controlled access point and guide the ego car to either stop or proceed with caution. They serve as safety devices, alerting the driver to road work or other unusual road conditions.\n\n2. **Barriers:** A gate or checkpoint blocks the lane ahead, featuring an illuminated stop sign on top. This barrier suggests controlled access to the area ahead, requiring the ego car to prepare to stop. The presence of personnel indicates that interaction may be necessary to gain permission to proceed.\n\n3. **Other Objects:** Near the center of the driving path ahead, there is a booth with lights and signage, potentially functioning as a security checkpoint or toll booth. The presence of this booth necessitates that the vehicle prepare to stop, interact with personnel if present, and potentially perform a transaction or follow specific instructions before continuing."

Use low beam headlights to enhance visibility without blinding oncoming traffic or booth personnel. Stay within the boundary set by the traffic cones and be ready to follow any instructions given at the booth. Exercise increased caution due to the low visibility conditions and unknown road surface state."
