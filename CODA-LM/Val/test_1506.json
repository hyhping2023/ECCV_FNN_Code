This large vehicle may slow down to turn or stop suddenly, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed accordingly.\n   - A green cargo truck further ahead in the opposite lane, heading toward the ego vehicle. While it should not directly affect the ego vehicle's lane, its presence should be monitored in case of sudden lane changes or obstacles causing it to swerve.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - There is a blue road sign to the right, indicating a junction or exit ahead for Xiying Road. This sign alerts the ego car to potential turning or merging vehicles around the indicated area.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light ahead is green, indicating the ego car can proceed. The green light suggests the path is clear, but the ego car should be prepared for potential yellow or red light changes requiring it to slow down or stop.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Orange traffic cones on the right, signaling a work zone and partially obstructing the right lane.
