Firstly, there is a large truck up ahead with its tail lights on, which suggests it may be stationary or moving slowly. The presence and condition of this truck necessitate a potential reduction in speed or complete stop. Additionally, there is a white truck on the right, facing in the same direction as our vehicle. While the truck is not currently blocking the path, it's crucial to proceed with caution given that it might begin moving.\n\nAlso present on the road is a motorcyclist to the right of our vehicle. The proximity of the motorcyclist requires heightened alertness to ensure their safety and that of the autonomous vehicle, accommodating sufficient space and readiness for any abrupt changes in their movement.\n\nLastly, observed on the right side of the truck is a wheeled handcart that appears stationary. Although it's not an immediate threat, an autonomous vehicle should keep track of such objects due to the risk they pose if they were to move onto the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the image. These categories are disregarded as they do not contain any objects in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, and if the truck's behavior indicates that it is stopping or turning, be prepared to stop or slow down, and be cautious of the white van and handcart on the right that could become obstacles. Due to low visibility, reduce speed and heighten alertness in case of unforeseen events or road users suddenly entering your field of view. Proceed with caution until a clearer view of road and traffic conditions is acquired. Additionally, be mindful of the small white vehicle on the left and the motorcyclist on the right, providing them with ample space and being ready to react to their sudden movements or stops. Continue carefully towards the intersection, always ready to respond to changing traffic lights or the actions of other road users.",
