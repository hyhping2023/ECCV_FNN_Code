        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under observation, there are several notable elements that are crucial for an autonomous vehicle's navigation decisions.\n\nFirstly, a large yellow construction vehicle is positioned right ahead of our vehicle, taking up the entire lane. This construction vehicle has the potential to travel at reduced speeds or stop abruptly due to its operational nature. Consequently, the following distance and speed of our vehicle must be adjusted to safely accommodate these possibilities.\n\nAdding to the scenario, there are multiple vehicles located in close proximity: in front of, adjacent to, and on the opposite lane from our vehicle. The behavior of these vehicles must be continuously assessed since their sudden stops, turns, or lane changes could significantly influence the driving strategy of our vehicle.\n\nOn the right side of the road, pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. While they are not directly on the road and therefore do not pose an immediate threat, it is imperative for autonomous vehicles to be alert. This vigilance is necessary to swiftly react if a pedestrian were to inadvertently step onto the roadway.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, there are other objects of interest. A pedestrian crossing signal light and a zebra crossing are situated on the right side of the road, signaling a point where pedestrians might cross. Despite no pedestrians being visible at the crossing at the moment, drivers must be cautious and be prepared for any individuals who may enter the crosswalk unexpectedly.\n\nIn addition, orange barriers are noted by the side of the road, indicating ongoing road construction or alterations to standard traffic patterns. These barriers serve as warnings of potential hazards or changes in the driving environment, necessitating the vehicle to stay alert and adjust its route when required."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the engineering vehicle ahead, paying attention to any changes in its speed or operational status. Be alert for pedestrians who may attempt to cross the road, and be prepared to stop or adjust your speed. Stay vigilant for possible lane changes or changes in traffic patterns caused by roadside traffic cones. Continue to drive carefully when the light is green, and re-evaluate if the light or road conditions change. The vehicle should also be ready to stop or slow down in response to traffic signals and potential pedestrian crosswalk activities and monitor surrounding traffic for any sudden changes in behavior. Overtaking large vehicles should be done with caution, ensuring clear visibility and adherence to traffic rules.",

This vehicle usually moves slower than standard traffic and may make sudden stops or maneuvers. Due to its size and the nature of its operation, it can obstruct the view of other road users, and the driver of the ego car should maintain a safe distance, reduce speed, and be prepared for unexpected movements.",
