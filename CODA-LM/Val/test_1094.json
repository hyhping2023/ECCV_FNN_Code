Their current positioning signals the possibility of an active work zone, which necessitates heightened caution due to the potential for unexpected movements that could affect the roadway.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a blue compact car that appears to be either stationary or progressing slowly. The proximity of this vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, requiring vigilance and readiness to respond to sudden stops or directional changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are mounds of snow and debris scattered along the roadside. These could potentially obstruct parts of the road or conceal other hazards, making careful navigation essential for the ego vehicle.\n\nThe summary does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, as no such elements are reported in the observed traffic image."
