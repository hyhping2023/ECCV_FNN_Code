        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large red truck on the right side of the intersection. It is stationary and extends partially into the adjacent lane, which could obscure visibility for other road users and may become a dynamic hazard if it starts moving. Caution is advised for the ego car, which may need to adjust speed or change lanes to maintain safety. Behind the red truck, a construction vehicle is parked near some roadwork. This vehicle's presence suggests that there might be active construction, and as such, unpredictable changes in traffic flow and potential obstructions on the road could occur.\n\nAdditionally, a group of construction workers is observed on the right, within the roadwork zone. Their movements close to the driving lane necessitate a reduction in speed and increased alertness from the ego car to prevent possible incidents.\n\nThe traffic light for the direction the ego car is facing is green, located at the top-left of the image. While this signal authorizes the car to continue, it must do so with care, taking into account the truck and workers nearby.\n\nFinally, there are concrete barriers set up along the right side of the road. These are demarcating the roadwork site and suggest that there is less driving space available, thus enforcing that slower speeds and extra caution are required while navigating past. Other categories such as traffic signs, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects are not present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a piece of heavy construction equipment, typically used for earthmoving or road construction tasks. Its presence suggests ongoing construction work, which may lead to road closures, detours, or reduced lanes. The vehicle's large size and slow movement require extra caution and awareness from the ego car's driver. Traffic around construction zones is often regulated by temporary signs or construction crew instructions, so the ego car must be prepared to follow these and drive at reduced speeds.",

Slow down to accommodate the workers' safety and navigate carefully past the construction area, respecting the changed road conditions due to barriers and uneven surfaces. Maintain readiness to stop or adjust the trajectory if unexpected behavior from the truck or workers is observed. Additionally, keep to the left to avoid the truck and any potential hazards associated with the roadwork. Continue to observe any changes in the road conditions and adjust driving behavior accordingly."
