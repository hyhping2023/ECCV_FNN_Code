The presence of this vehicle affects the autonomous vehicle's options for changing lanes or adjusting speed to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist on the right edge of the right lane, slightly ahead of our vehicle, also moving in the same direction. The motorcyclist poses a situation that requires cautious maneuvering by the autonomous vehicle to prevent any possible accidents.\n\nLastly, an object, possibly a plastic bag or piece of debris, can be seen on the driveway. The autonomous vehicle must consider this object as it could contain materials that may damage the vehicle's undercarriage or disrupt the vehicleâ€™s sensor operations, presenting a potential risk.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are mentioned in the data, indicating that none of these features are present in the traffic scene."

Pay close attention to motorcyclists, and be prepared to react if they enter your lane or make sudden changes.

For the driver of the ego vehicle, it is crucial to monitor the plastic bag since it might obstruct the view or get caught in the vehicle's external parts like mirrors or wheels. If it appears to be blown towards the vehicle's path, the driver should be prepared to react, such as by slowing down or safely changing lanes to avoid it if necessary.",
