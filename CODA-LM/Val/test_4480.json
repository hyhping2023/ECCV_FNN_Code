        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present. However, the presence of other objects is notable. Specifically, there are trash bins situated to the right side of the road, adjacent to spilled debris. The positioning of these bins close to the curb indicates that they do not pose a direct obstacle to the ego car, assuming the vehicle maintains its lane and maneuvers to avoid the debris. Additionally, there is a brightly lit sign visible in the top right corner of the image, which likely belongs to a business and protrudes into the roadway. Although this sign does not physically obstruct the ego car's path, its luminosity and position may create visual clutter, potentially distracting the driver for a moment. This distraction could affect the driver's ability to fully observe road conditions or notice other road users ahead, thereby impacting driving behavior."

Use of hazard lights may also be beneficial to warn following traffic of the obstacle ahead."
