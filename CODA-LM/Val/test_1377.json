The only road user identified is a motorcyclist. The motorcyclist is traveling ahead on the right side of the ego car, which must be considered regarding driving behavior. They are wearing dark clothing and their motorcycle's tail lights are on, indicating motion. It's important to monitor the motorcyclist's movements as they require extra attention from the ego car to anticipate any potential changes in speed or direction that could influence the ego car's planned path."

This individual is using the roadway and is sharing the space with other vehicles such as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist requires the driver of the ego car to exercise caution and potentially adjust speed and position to maintain a safe distance and ensure the safety of both the cyclist and the occupants of the ego car. Depending on local traffic laws, the ego car may need to pass the cyclist with a wide berth or wait behind the cyclist until it is safe to overtake.",
