This obstacle may suggest that only authorized personnel can enter the area beyond this point, or it could be a closed section of the road. As a result, the autonomous vehicle should be prepared to stop or detour in case access is restricted.\n\nNear the fence, there is a chair and a stationary figure, who may be a security guard or a worker associated with the checkpoint or construction area. The presence of personnel by the roadside necessitates increased caution and readiness to respond to any unexpected movements or signals at any time.\n\nThere are no traffic signs or traffic lights in the image that need to be considered. Traffic signs, traffic lights, and other vehicles are absent from the scene, which simplifies the driving context to some extent."

    "driving_suggestion": "Remain vigilant around the personnel by the tents and be prepared to stop if necessary. Slow down when approaching traffic cones and stay alert for signs indicating changes to traffic patterns. Adjust the sun visor as needed and use sunglasses to mitigate visibility issues caused by sunlight. When approaching temporary obstacles, your vehicle should slow down and be ready to stop or detour according to the directions that might be provided by personnel or signs. Moreover, monitor lanes that are marked with traffic cones and safely change lanes when necessary. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, and due to traffic cones and temporary obstacles, monitor any available lane space changes on the right lane, and be prepared to adjust lane position if needed. Watch out for any unexpected pedestrian movements that might occur at the stalls and where people are on the right-hand side. Continue to monitor changes in any traffic control devices or road conditions ahead, as these changes might not be immediately visible in this image.",
