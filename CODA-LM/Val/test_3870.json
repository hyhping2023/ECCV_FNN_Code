The truck is a very large size, making it difficult to see around or past it. It appears to carry construction equipment and has a high center of gravity, which could pose rollover risks if it makes sudden maneuvers.",

The large physical size and potential for unexpected movements mean that the ego car should be prepared for possible abrupt changes from the truck."

They indicate that the ego vehicle should stay within the lane markings and avoid any unnecessary lateral movements that could bring it too close to the barriers. The barriers define the drivable area and restrict the ego car from changing lanes or leaving the roadway, indicating a caution for potential maintenance or hazards."

            "description and explanation": "A large, specialized vehicle typically used at construction sites is present, most likely a type of concrete mixer. It is characterized by a revolving drum used to mix concrete components. When encountering such a vehicle on the road, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards associated with the vehicle's size, movement, or the possibility of construction materials being transported. In this scenario, the ego car may need to slow down and be prepared for potential stops or reduced speed due to construction activity.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck ahead, taking into account its larger size and potential slower speed. Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed to improve vehicle control and stopping distance. Stay alert for any unexpected actions from the truck, such as sudden braking or debris falling off. Since the road is lined with barriers, do not attempt to overtake. Continuously monitor the situation for any changes and adjust driving behavior as necessary. The ego car should monitor the truck's signals and brake lights for cues on its actions. Overtaking should be avoided unless a clear and safe opportunity presents itself, and adhering to the wet road precautions is critical."
