A silver sedan is positioned on the left side of the ego vehicle, in the leftmost lane, and is moving parallel to the ego vehicle in the same direction. This vehicle's proximity and parallel movement could influence the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes to the left. The ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop in response to the sedan's actions.\n\n2. A black truck with articulated machinery mounted on its rear is located directly in front of the ego vehicle within the same lane, moving in the same direction. Due to its size and potential slower speed, the truck requires monitoring for any sudden stops or turns that could affect the ego vehicle's path. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance because of the truck's size and the potential for sudden stops or debris falling from the load.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."

Moreover, continue to monitor the road for any changes in the traffic conditions or the appearance of traffic signs or signals."
