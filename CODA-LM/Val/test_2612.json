Firstly, there is a cement mixer truck parked directly ahead with its brake lights illuminated, indicating it may be stationary or preparing to move but blocking the road. This requires the autonomous vehicle to keep a safe distance, ready to come to a halt or reroute if necessary. Furthermore, to the left of the mixer truck, a red container truck is parked adjacent to a white van, limiting the movement of the autonomous vehicle on that side of the road.\n\nOn the right side, a cyclist is spotted traversing the road on a zebra crossing, compelling the autonomous vehicle to yield until the cyclist has moved out of harm's way safely. Additionally, there is a pedestrian crossing traffic sign by the roadside on the right at the intersection, alerting drivers to be cautious and give right of way to any pedestrians that may cross.\n\nOverhead, the traffic signal displays a red light in the direction the vehicle is traveling, mandating the vehicle to come to a complete stop until it turns green.\n\nIt should be noted that no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the data, indicating their absence from the scene."

At the same time, this vehicle should pay attention to observe cyclists and pedestrians crossing the street, ensuring they have completely cleared the vehicle's path before proceeding. When the green light comes on, this vehicle can drive carefully, be aware of wet and slippery road conditions, and reduce speed for safety.",
