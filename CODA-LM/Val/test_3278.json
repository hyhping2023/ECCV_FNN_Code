Reduce speed if necessary to react safely to any potential hazards that may arise due to the presence of the cones or any other unforeseen obstacles. Maintain lane while observing the sequence of traffic cones on your right which may indicate potential hazards or lane closures ahead. Reduce speed if necessary, and prepare to merge left if signs or road markings indicate a lane closure. Continue to monitor the road while being cautious of any workers or unexpected obstacles. Because this is a night-time driving scenario with reduced visibility, use your headlights appropriately and stay alert."
