It has reflective markings and its rear lights are on, which suggests that it is currently in use. This vehicle could potentially make slow or sudden movements, and its presence indicates a potential obstacle for the ego car. The vehicle's stop might be temporary or due to a loading or unloading process, so caution is advised.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple pedestrians on the sides of the three-wheeled vehicle, indicating possible interaction with the vehicle or an intention to cross the road. One pedestrian is already crossing the road in front of the three-wheeled vehicle, moving from the left to the right side. These pedestrians are unpredictable and may enter the path of the ego vehicle, which requires careful monitoring and preparedness to stop. Since pedestrians have the right of way, the vehicle must be ready to stop to ensure their safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

Also, the ego car should observe for any indicators from the three-wheeled vehicle such as brake lights or turn signals for any potential turns or stops that could affect the flow of traffic. The ego car should reduce its speed and increase its following distance due to the wet road conditions. It should also prepare to stop or navigate around the three-wheeled vehicle and the pedestrians, who might unexpectedly enter the road. Use of headlights and lower beam is recommended to increase visibility and to signal the car's presence to other road users. The ego car should continuously monitor these road users for any changes in behavior or position."
