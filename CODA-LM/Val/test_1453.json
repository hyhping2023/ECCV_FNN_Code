This person may move onto the road, posing a potential problem for vehicles. Additionally, near the parked bicycles, the road surface is littered with unidentifiable objects, and insufficient lighting causes blurred vision, while artificial light sources produce glare effects.

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of bicycles on the roadside, poor lighting conditions leading to reduced visibility, and the potential for wet and slippery road surfaces, cautious driving is advised. Maintain a lower speed to allow more time to react to sudden obstacles or road users. Be prepared to stop or slow down if pedestrians or new cyclists start using the road. Keep a safe distance from parked bicycles and unknown objects on the road to avoid any contact if they suddenly move or enter the roadway.",

As a small and nimble vehicle, it may behave unpredictably in traffic compared to larger vehicles. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or changes in the moped's direction. The driver should also be aware of traffic regulations regarding mopeds, which might be different from those for cars and larger vehicles.",
