Vehicles:\n   - A large construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck, is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane. The mixerâ€™s drum, chute, and other components are visible. The presence and large size of the construction vehicle may block the view ahead and reduce the maneuverability for the ego car.

Its size and position limit the ability of the ego car to maneuver around it safely, and it may also potentially drop debris from the mixing drum.\n   - A red car is visible on the right side further down the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car.

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle typically used to mix and transport concrete. It is characterized by a large rotating drum, usually mounted at the rear of the vehicle, and various chutes and hoses used for dispensing the concrete. The presence of this vehicle indicates active or recent construction work in the area. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle due to its operational requirements or when it maneuvers around the construction site. The driver should also be vigilant for any construction workers or related traffic control signals and signs in the vicinity.",

Use indicators if changing lanes is necessary and be vigilant for any construction signs, workers, or sudden movements from the vehicle ahead. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from the red car on the right to allow for reaction time if it makes an unexpected maneuver. Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck to account for its unpredictable movements and potential to drop debris. Monitor the red car on the right lane for an opportunity to overtake the concrete mixer truck when it is safe to do so. Continuously evaluate the distance and speed of the red car and use turn signals early before changing lanes to inform other road users of the intention to maneuver. Be vigilant for the pedestrian on the left side of the road and prepared to stop or yield if they enter the roadway. Continuously assess the possibility of a safe lane change to the left, checking for the position and speed of the vehicle in the adjacent lane to overtake the mixer truck if needed and if it is safe and legal to do so."
