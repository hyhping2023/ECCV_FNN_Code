These parked vehicles narrow the drivable area, necessitating more careful maneuvering by the ego vehicle, particularly when sharing the road with oncoming traffic.\n\nMoreover, there are pedestrians located at the edge of the left side of the street, positioned just ahead of the ego vehicle, under low-light conditions. Given their proximity to the roadway and the potential for compromised visibility, there is an increased risk of them entering the road unexpectedly, which requires the ego vehicle to pay extra attention.\n\nLastly, there is a small, light-colored object of uncertain status in the middle of the road ahead of the ego vehicle. The ambiguity of whether this object is static or in motion creates a risk, and the ego vehicle must be prepared to either navigate around it safely or come to a stop to avoid a collision."
