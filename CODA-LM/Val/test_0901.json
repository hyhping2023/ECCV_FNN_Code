        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are influencing the driving conditions. Firstly, there is a white SUV ahead in the same lane, maintaining a moderate distance and steadily driving in its lane. The presence of this SUV is important as it dictates the following distance and speed of our vehicle, and the driver must be prepared to react to any sudden stops or turns the SUV might make.\n\nAdditionally, a cement mixer truck is present in the left lane, diagonally in front of our vehicle. It appears to be moving forward or possibly attempting to merge left due to a lane closure. The size of the truck may block the view ahead and could create hazards if it merges into our lane, so it is crucial for our vehicle to monitor its movements closely.\n\nThere is also a directional arrow sign on the road, indicating that there is a lane closure ahead and that vehicles should turn left or merge. This sign is essential for informing the driver about the upcoming road conditions and the need to change lanes.\n\nLastly, a green fence is situated on the right side of the road, marking a work area or lane closure. The fence serves as a barrier to direct traffic away from potentially hazardous areas and to facilitate the implementation of the lane closure.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle must maintain a safe distance from the SUV ahead and prepare to merge left in accordance with the road signs directing us and the barriers indicating the closure of the right lane. The driver should be vigilant for the cement mixer in the left lane and remain alert to its possible merging movements. It is necessary to monitor the surroundings and slow down to safely change lanes when needed. Before changing lanes, checking the rearview mirror and side mirrors to understand the behavior of the surrounding vehicles is crucial. Furthermore, our vehicle should reduce speed and be wary of any activities from road construction that may affect driving conditions. When changing lanes, use the turn signal to communicate this action to other road users. Continue to observe the possible interactions from the white vehicle in the far-right lane and maintain overall awareness while passing through the construction area.",
