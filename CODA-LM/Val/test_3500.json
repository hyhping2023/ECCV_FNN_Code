                "explanation": "Both vehicles are very heavy and could potentially move suddenly; the concrete mixer may perform unpredictable maneuvers while pouring concrete. The mixer's large size and its position in the right lane directly affect the driving behavior of our vehicle. If our vehicle intends to overtake, it may need to change lanes, or if it maintains its lane, it must keep a safe following distance. This limits the available lane width for our vehicle, and attempting to overtake could lead to the risk of a sideswipe collision."

These obstacles suggest that there may be construction ahead or the road may be narrowing. Self-driving vehicles need to drive cautiously to avoid any actions that might bring them too close to the obstacles, which could pose a collision risk. There are low obstacles, possibly concrete, that separate the traffic lanes. These structures define the traffic lanes and restrict the ability of vehicles (including self-driving vehicles) to perform lateral maneuvers."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, the scene features specific road users and obstacles:\n\n1. **Vehicles**: \n   - There is a concrete mixer truck ahead with a large rotating drum and chute. Additionally, to the right, a truck with a green open-top cargo space is present. \n   - Both these vehicles are significant due to their weight and potential for sudden movements. The concrete mixer, in particular, may perform unpredictable maneuvers while pouring concrete. Given their positions, if the ego vehicle intends to overtake, it might need to change lanes or maintain a safe following distance to avoid any collisions, which restricts the lane width available for the ego vehicle.\n\n2. **Barriers**:\n   - On the left side of the road, parallel to the concrete mixer truck, there are rectangular, interlocking beige barriers.\n   - These barriers indicate construction areas or lane dividers, limiting the space for vehicles, potentially hinting at roadwork or narrowing lanes. For the self-driving vehicle, this necessitates cautious driving to avoid contact with the barriers, as there is a risk of collision. These structures define the traffic lanes and prevent lateral maneuvers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck ahead, and if required by the construction zone, be prepared to merge to the right. Pay attention to traffic cones and fence signage, and be alert for possible merging or turning movements of trucks, as well as construction vehicles entering and exiting the road. This vehicle should keep a safe distance behind the concrete mixer, monitoring its brake lights, and be ready to slow down or stop if necessary. Lane changing should only be considered when it is safe to do so on the left and there is enough space behind the truck to merge without causing disruption. The driver should also be constantly aware of changes in road conditions indicated by fences on the left, which may suggest a construction area or roadwork. Due to the narrow space on the left caused by the protruding mixer and the passage of heavy vehicles on the right, this vehicle should stay at a safe distance behind the concrete mixer and wait for the road ahead to clear. Due to close traffic and obstacles, this vehicle should avoid changing lanes.",
