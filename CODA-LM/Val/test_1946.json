This situation requires the ego car to be ready to perform an emergency maneuver to avoid any damage. Additionally, there are multiple cars driving in parallel lanes next to the ego car, maintaining a similar speed. The ego car must monitor these vehicles closely as they may change lanes or adjust their speed without warning, necessitating a safe following distance.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic light visible ahead is green, granting the right of way to the ego car and other road users. Despite the permission to proceed, the ego car should stay alert and be prepared to stop if the light changes or to respond to unexpected incidents, such as the aforementioned falling debris from the truck.\n\nLastly, guardrails are installed along the side of the road, delineating the boundary between the roadway and pedestrian zones, as well as other parts of the infrastructure. These barriers serve as a reminder to the ego car of the limits of the drivable area and the regions that are inaccessible to vehicles."

Furthermore, it should continue to monitor the traffic light to respond to any changes. Regular scans of the mirrors and blind spots will optimize situational awareness throughout this traffic scenario."
