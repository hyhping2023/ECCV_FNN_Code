        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image analyzed, there are two significant observations pertaining to vehicles on the road. Firstly, a large truck is noted to occupy both the opposite lane and a part of our lane, partially due to the oversize load of construction materials it carries. This peculiar position and the potential for its load to shift or fall off categorize it as a potential hazard. Therefore, it mandates a careful approach from our vehicle, which might have to either slow down or completely stop, ensuring it's safe to maneuver past this obstacle.\n\nAdditionally, there's an approaching car from the opposite direction, easily distinguishable by its activated headlights. The presence of this vehicle, along with the illumination from its headlights, demands heightened vigilance. It signals the necessity for our car to possibly adjust its lane position slightly to the right. This adjustment aims to maintain a safe and prudent distance, safeguarding against any unforeseen developments that might compromise safety.\n\nIn this scene, no other road users such as vulnerable road users (including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists), traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are reported. This concentration on vehicular traffic underlines the critical interaction between larger and smaller vehicles in shared road spaces, underscoring key safety considerations essential for autonomous driving systems."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should immediately slow down and prepare to carefully navigate around the truck. At the same time, it is necessary to monitor oncoming traffic to ensure that it is possible to bypass the obstacle without interfering with vehicles coming from the opposite direction. Due to the wet road conditions, maintaining a high level of alertness is crucial for safely maneuvering around the obstacle. If the space is too narrow or unsafe, the vehicle should wait until the oncoming traffic clears, the truck has enough room to return to its own lane, or stops (if possible).",
