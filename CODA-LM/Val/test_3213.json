This vehicle may merge onto the main road, which could pose a potential danger to other vehicles merging or crossing in this lane.\n\nOn the left, there is a circular speed limit sign indicating a limit of 5 kilometers per hour. This suggests that the area is intended for slow-moving traffic, such as the entrance to a parking lot or service area, and vehicles should reduce their speed accordingly.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are positioned along the right side of the highway, creating a visual barrier at the roadside. These cones suggest the presence of road construction or areas where parking or driving is prohibited, signaling that vehicles should stay within the lane and avoid crossing the cones.\n\nMetal railings are present along the road, separating the traffic lanes from the sidewalks and other areas. These barriers indicate that crossing between the road and adjacent areas is not allowed, reinforcing the designated driving path for vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are plants and shrubs by the roadside. While they do not encroach on the path, they may obscure potential hazards or pedestrians at intersections or entrances and exits. Autonomous vehicles should remain vigilant when approaching areas with reduced visibility due to these plants."
