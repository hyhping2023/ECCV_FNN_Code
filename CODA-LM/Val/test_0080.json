The car directly in front of the ego vehicle has its brake lights on, indicating a slowdown or stop. This suggests the ego car must prepare for a potential traffic slowdown or stoppage.\n- A bus is seen on the left lane, either stationary or moving slowly, identified by its red taillights. The bus could indicate potential pedestrian activity or stopping traffic that the ego car should monitor.\n- A white car is cutting into the ego vehicle's lane from the right. This manoeuvre requires the ego car to either slow down or adjust its position to avoid a collision.\n\nFor vulnerable road users:\n- A pedestrian wearing a red jacket is on the right side of the road, standing close to a parked car. This person's position near the road edge and the parked vehicle suggests the potential for sudden pedestrian movement into the roadway.\n- Another person, also in red, is standing by a blue trash bin on the right side of the road. While this individual does not pose an immediate threat to traffic, their proximity to the roadway needs to be noted in case they step into the road.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs:\n- A pedestrian crossing sign is visible on the left side of the road. This sign alerts the ego car to the possible presence of pedestrians and signifies an area where extra caution should be taken.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones:\n- These cones are positioned in a line to segment the right lane from the center lane, guiding traffic flow and indicating a lane reduction or roadwork ahead. The ego car must remain within the demarcated lane and be alert for any changes in traffic pattern or road workers.\n\nLastly, other objects in the scene include:\n- Trees and foliage lining the street, which do not obstruct the roadway. While these do not immediately affect driving behavior, the ego car should remain aware of potential hazards like falling branches in tree-lined areas."

Stay in the designated lane marked by the traffic cones and be prepared for potential merges or shifts in traffic flow. Remain vigilant and ready to react to unexpected pedestrian or vehicle movements. The ego vehicle should continue proceeding with caution due to the heavy congestion and be prepared to stop or slow down because of the white car cutting in. The driver should be aware of the pedestrian crossing sign and be on the lookout for any pedestrians that may enter the crossing. Since traffic cones are present, the ego car should be prepared to merge or follow new traffic patterns. It's important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, and be prepared for sudden stops in traffic flow."
