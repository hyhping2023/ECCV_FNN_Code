The signs serve as a notice for the ego car to reduce speed and to be prepared for potential alterations in the traffic flow.\n\nThe traffic lights visible in the scene show red for both the lanes in front of the ego car and the cross traffic, which mandates that the ego car must remain at a halt until the light turns green.\n\nYellow and black traffic cones can be found around the construction area to the right, setting a clear boundary between the roadway and the work zone. These cones must guide the ego vehicle's route and indicate areas that should be avoided.\n\nThere are also temporary barriers and fencing encompassing the construction site at the intersection's right side, marking off an area that is off-limits. As a result, the ego car should be alert to constriction of the driving area and potential hazards from the construction activity.\n\nLastly, mobile cranes are active within the construction zone, and they can be seen carrying loads above the ground. Although they are not encroaching on the roadway, their presence points to ongoing construction that could influence the flow of traffic and necessitates vigilance for unexpected obstacles or personnel entering the road."
