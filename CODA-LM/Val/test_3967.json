        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects present. However, there is a notable presence of a vulnerable road user: an animal, most likely a cow or a large quadruped. It is situated in the center of the road, facing leftward. The animal is directly illuminated by the headlights of a vehicle, which creates a stark contrast against the dark background of the surroundings.\n\nThe presence of this large animal on the road presents a considerable hazard. Such an animal is inherently unpredictable and may move abruptly, which could put both the animal and vehicle occupants at risk. Consequently, the driver of the vehicle must exercise extreme caution and be ready to come to a full stop if necessary to avoid a collision."

The presence of this animal on the road requires the driver to be cautious and prepared to slow down or stop to avoid a collision. The driver should monitor the animal's movements and wait until the dog is safely away from the roadway before proceeding.

Utilize high-beam headlights if there are no oncoming vehicles to improve visibility. If possible, safely alert the animal of your presence with your vehicle's horn to encourage it to move out of harm's way. Do not attempt to drive around the animal until it is safe to do so, as it may become spooked and behave unpredictably. Activate hazard lights to warn other road users. Once stopped, if the animal does not move, the driver may need to slowly drive around the animal, ensuring there is ample space to do so safely if the conditions allow or wait until the path is clear. Extra caution must be applied due to the low visibility conditions, as there may be more hazards not immediately visible."
