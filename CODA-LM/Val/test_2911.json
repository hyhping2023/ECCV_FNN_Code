The presence of this pedestrian necessitates caution, as they may be preparing to cross the road or working near traffic, which could require the ego car to stop or slow down.\n\nWhile there are no traffic signs or lights visible in the current perspective that would impact driving behavior, there are traffic cones present. One cone is on the right, placed on the sidewalk near the pedestrian, suggesting potential hazards or changes in road layout ahead, although it does not currently affect driving. Another yellow cone is on the left-hand side, at the edge of the sidewalk, indicating possible construction, road hazards, or a need to redirect traffic flow. The ego car must remain cautious and may need to adjust its path accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a metal barrier runs along the right-hand side of the road, separating the sidewalk from the street. This barrier indicates that pedestrians should cross only at designated points and also narrows the available road space, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution.\n\nNo other objects, such as debris or dustbins, are visible in the roadways that would affect driving behavior, indicating no immediate concern for evasive maneuvers."

Keep a safe distance from the sidewalk in case the pedestrian decides to enter the road. Continue to monitor the sides for any additional pedestrians or unexpected obstacles that may come into the driving path."
