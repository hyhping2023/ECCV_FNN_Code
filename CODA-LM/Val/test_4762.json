        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, two vehicles are noted in the scene. A white van is located directly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle and a red vehicle is positioned slightly ahead in the adjacent lane to the left. These vehicles are considered potential navigational obstructions, and they may influence decisions regarding speed and lane choice of the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, to the right side of the road, there are orange traffic cones set up, creating a demarcation between the driving lane and an area where cars are parked. This barrier suggests a section of the road that should be avoided, possibly due to ongoing construction work or for safety reasons, guiding the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance.\n\nLastly, the image includes several parked cars aligned along the right side of the road. It is crucial for the ego vehicle to monitor these parked cars for any unexpected movements that may affect the flow of traffic.\n\nOverall, navigating this scenario requires careful consideration of the vehicles ahead, adherence to the guidance provided by the traffic cones, and vigilance for sudden movements from the parked vehicles, ensuring safe passage through the area."

The ego car should also be prepared to brake or maneuver cautiously in case any of the parked vehicles on the right side enter the road."
