        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are two notable observations. The first identifies a vehicle situated at the right side of the frame, with its headlights on and oriented away from the viewpoint of the ego vehicle. The presence of this vehicle suggests that it might either be parked or temporarily stationary due to road conditions or an incident. This situation requires the ego vehicle to exercise caution as the stationary vehicle might obstruct part of the lane or signal a potential hazard lying further on the road.\n\nThe second observation is related to a series of orange traffic cones equipped with reflective stripes. These cones are arranged diagonally across the lane, leading towards the aforementioned vehicle. This arrangement of cones is indicative of either a road closure or a diversion path that the ego car is obliged to follow. It serves as a signal for the ego vehicle to decrease speed and prepare for a change in direction to navigate around the cordoned-off area, underlining a possible lane closure or redirection of the traffic flow."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is typically used to redirect traffic in a safe manner. It serves as a warning signal for drivers to alter their path to avoid a potential hazard or to follow a different route, usually in cases of road construction, accidents, or other road disruptions. The cone is usually bright orange and made of a flexible material with a white band for visibility. These qualities are important for capturing the driver's attention and conveying the need for caution. When approaching traffic cones, the driver of the ego vehicle would likely need to slow down and steer away from the cones to continue driving along the available path, ensuring safety.",

Its purpose is to act as a temporary traffic control device that guides vehicles by delineating the boundary of safe driving paths, restricting entry into hazardous areas, and cautioning of roadwork or traffic disruptions ahead. In this driving scenario, it indicates that the driver of the ego car should reduce speed and possibly prepare to change lanes to avoid the area marked by these devices.",

Use caution and observe for any additional signs or personnel that may provide further instructions."
