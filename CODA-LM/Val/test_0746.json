        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a large yellow truck on the right side, sharing the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving forward. The presence of this truck is important as it occupies part of the lane, which could limit the ego vehicle's options for maneuvering. Additionally, the size of the truck might block the ego car's view of signals or other road users that may be ahead.\n\nMoving on to traffic signs, there are multiple road signs on the right, with at least one blue circular sign that likely indicates a mandatory direction to follow. These signs are essential as they convey directions and information necessary for the ego vehicle to navigate the roadway safely.\n\nRegarding the traffic lights, there are lights ahead displaying a green signal. For the ego vehicle, this means it has the clearance to continue driving, but it should retain a level of readiness in case the light changes.\n\nLastly, there are white plastic barriers on the left side of the ego vehicle. These barriers serve the purpose of segregating the traffic lanes and as such, they also indicate that lane switching or merging is not permitted at this point, thus restricting the lateral movement of the ego car."

Its presence suggests there may be construction ahead or that it is actively being used for work in the area. This means the ego car should maintain a cautious speed and be prepared for potential obstacles or changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures or construction workers on the road. The ego car should also give the construction vehicle plenty of space in case it makes sudden movements or stops.",

Keep an eye out for any signals the truck may give for turning or changing lanes. Stay in the current lane due to the lane barriers and continue driving while observing the traffic light for any changes. If the truck exhibits erratic behavior, be prepared to reduce speed or stop if necessary, always ensuring to obey traffic light signals. Additionally, the ego car should observe the road signs as they approach for any changes in mandatory directions and be ready to comply. Proceed through the intersection with caution, mindful that the green light is subject to change and other road users may enter the intersection."
