        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large truck with a concrete mixer on the right side of the ego vehicle. It is occupying part of the adjacent lane and appears to be in motion, which could potentially obstruct the ego vehicle's path. Due to the truck's proximity and its partial occupation of the left lane, the ego vehicle must slow down or maintain a safe distance to prevent reduced visibility and maneuverability, and to avoid unsafe situations like the truck merging into the same lane.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic signs present that indicate a mandatory right turn and a roundabout ahead. There are also signs showing a right turn arrow, which may suggest a merging lane or fork, and another sign with the same symbol oriented to the left, possibly indicating a directional change or an upcoming intersection. These signs are crucial for the ego vehicle to be aware of the approaching right turn, to prepare for a potential change in road layout, to anticipate possible merging traffic, to navigate the roundabout, and to adjust speed accordingly.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

The ego car should be prepared to potentially change lanes if the truck obstructs the lane and if it's safe to do so, in accordance with the mandatory turn signage and be mindful of potential blind spots created by the large vehicle ahead."
