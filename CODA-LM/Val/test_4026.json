It has a reflective surface to catch the headlights of vehicles, alerting drivers to its presence especially in low-light conditions. Its placement may indicate that there are road works ahead, or a section of the road is closed, which means the ego car should slow down and proceed with caution, possibly detouring around the cone or following an altered traffic lane.",

The driver needs to search for detour signs or an alternate route around the obstruction. In the absence of a detour sign, the ego car should stop at a safe distance before the barrier and determine the best alternative path to continue its route, possibly by reversing and taking a different road. It is also important to switch on the hazard lights to alert any following vehicles of the unexpected stop or detour."
