The ego car should also monitor the truck's brake lights and be prepared to reduce speed or stop if the truck's brake lights suggest deceleration or stopping. Additionally, the driver should be vigilant for any reflections of traffic lights on wet surfaces or other signals from the truck to anticipate its movements. Speed adjustments and careful steering are recommended to handle the wet road conditions safely."
