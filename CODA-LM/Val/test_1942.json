                "description": "A large heavy truck was severely overloaded, occupying almost the entire width of the opposite lane, and was heading straight towards our vehicle.",
                "explanation": "Due to the large size of wide-load vehicles, the cargo may shift or extend further into one's lane, necessitating cautious driving and possibly a reduction in speed. Because of the excessive load, if the truck sways or the cargo shifts, it could pose a risk, so it is important to stay alert and be prepared to stop if necessary. Since the truck fully occupies its lane and is large in size, there is a potential risk of the truck accidentally crossing into one's lane, especially if the truck makes any sudden movements or encounters obstacles."

The existence of motorcyclists necessitates self-driving vehicles to be prepared to slow down or adjust their lane position to maintain a safe following distance, especially when oncoming wide-load vehicles constrain the space."

The position of the sun may cause glare, reducing the visibility of both the driver of this vehicle and other drivers coming from the opposite direction, which could lead to slower reaction times."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several road users and elements with specific characteristics that affect driving behavior.\n\nFirstly, there's a large heavy truck that is overloaded and occupies almost the entire width of the opposite lane. It is heading straight towards our vehicle. The truck's size and load dictate cautious driving, such as reducing speed and being prepared to stop, due to the potential risk of the truck swaying, the cargo shifting, and accidental incursion into our lane.\n\nAlso spotted is a cement mixer truck on the opposite side of the road, moving away from our self-driving vehicle. While it does not pose an immediate threat, it requires monitoring in case it makes sudden stops or turns that could impact traffic flow.\n\nOn the opposite lane, a motorcyclist is observed heading in the same direction as our car. This necessitates maintaining safe following distances and being ready to adjust lane positions due to the additional space constraints presented by oncoming wide-load vehicles.\n\nLastly, the image captures tree shadows on the road, slightly reducing visibility and suggesting bright, possibly low sunlight that can cause glare. This can affect reaction times and demands a speed adjustment according to the varying light conditions to ensure safety.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this scene, nor are there any additional objects apart from the tree shadows that have been mentioned."

    "driving_suggestion": "When preparing to overtake, maintain a safe following distance from cyclists and motorcyclists, and do so when it is safe. Be particularly cautious when approaching heavy trucks, as they often occupy most of the opposite lane, closely monitoring any irregular movements or potential hazards. Due to the width of the truck's load, it's best to slow down and assess whether there is enough space to safely pass. If overtaking a cyclist, ensure to do it at a safe distance and be prepared to deal with possible obstacles that might cause the cyclist to turn suddenly or change their course. Continuously monitoring the oncoming lane is crucial for timely response to dynamic situations. Considering the presence of wide-load vehicles and motorcyclists ahead in the oncoming lane, it's advised to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance with motorcyclists to allow for a safe braking distance and stay alert to any potential dangers from wide-load vehicles, such as their loads extending into your lane. If visibility is affected by glare, consider using headlights to ensure your vehicle is more visible to oncoming traffic.",

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle partially obstructs the lane ahead. It appears to be a dump truck commonly used to transport materials such as dirt or gravel. Due to its size and positioning, it limits the available space for vehicles to maneuver around it. As a result, when approaching this obstacle, the ego vehicle must either slow down and wait for a safe opportunity to pass, or it may need to stop completely if oncoming traffic or road conditions do not permit a safe pass.",
