The driver should also be ready to adjust speed and position as dictated by the lane restrictions and any instructions on the construction signs. Caution should be exercised because of the construction barriers, which may require a lane change if the current lane becomes blocked or merges with another. Stay alert for any sudden movements from the truck, such as stopping or backing up, particularly given its nature of operation where it may need to do so for work purposes."
