First, there is a large tanker truck in the same lane as the ego vehicle. This truck occupies a significant portion of the lane and obstructs the view ahead, necessitating increased following distance due to its size and position limiting maneuverability and visibility. Additionally, a green bus is seen on the left side, traveling parallel to the ego vehicle. Monitoring the bus is important to anticipate any potential lane changes or stops that might impact traffic flow. \n\nThere is also a pedestrian close to the roadside near the tanker truck. This pedestrian's proximity to the road poses a potential hazard, and the ego vehicle should be prepared to take evasive action if the pedestrian steps onto the roadway.\n\nLastly, reflections and possible raindrops on the windshield indicate current or recent precipitation. These conditions reduce visibility and can lead to wet road surfaces, necessitating slower driving speeds for safety."

Given its size and the nature of its operation, buses may stop frequently and make wide turns. When driving behind a bus, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance to account for sudden stops and afford sufficient time for reacting to the bus's actions.

Caution is advised due to the limited sight distance provided by the large vehicle ahead. Additionally, the ego car should be aware of the green bus in the neighboring lane, be prepared for any potential lane changes from the bus, and adjust speed or position accordingly. Given the wet road conditions, the ego car should reduce speed to allow for increased stopping time. Overall, caution and readiness to react to other users' actions are advised."
