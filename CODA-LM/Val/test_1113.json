        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two vehicles and one vulnerable road user identified. \n\nThe first vehicle is a black sedan located ahead on the left side of the road, facing the same direction of travel as our vehicle. It is important to be aware of this sedan because it may slow down, stop suddenly, or make an unpredicted move. Therefore, our vehicle needs to maintain a safe distance and be ready to react to any of the sedan's actions.\n\nAdditionally, there's a yellow crane parked on the opposite side of the road. The presence of this crane is significant since it might block or narrow the traffic lane, obliging drivers to decelerate or maneuver around it.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist on the right side, traveling in the same direction as our car towards a parked crane truck. The positioning of the cyclist reduces the room available for our autonomous vehicle to alter its trajectory, necessitating cautious speed control and continuous vigilance.\n\nNoticeably, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image. Therefore, attention is concentrated on the vehicles and the cyclist as described."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of parked trucks, oncoming construction vehicles, and cyclists, our vehicle should slow down and prepare to navigate through the narrow road. Before safely passing the crane truck, it may be necessary to wait until there is no oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. At the same time, ensure not to encroach on the cyclists' path. Our vehicle should closely monitor the movements of cyclists and be prepared to adjust its position within the lane to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from the black sedan ahead, and be ready to change lanes at any moment if it starts to slow down or block the lane.",

            "description and explanation": "A yellow mobile crane vehicle with an extendable boom and outriggers is depicted. With the ability to lift and move heavy objects at construction sites, it is crucial for logistical and construction tasks. Its presence on the road can affect traffic flow, as it may take up more space than a regular vehicle and occasionally require temporary road closures or lane restrictions to perform its operations safely. The ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden stops or slow movement associated with such heavy equipment.",
