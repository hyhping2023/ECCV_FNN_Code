This creates a potential for lane changes or merging, which may require the ego vehicle to adjust its lane position and speed.\n\nTo the right and slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a silver SUV in an adjacent lane, moving in the same direction. The position of this vehicle could influence the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right if necessary.\n\nMultiple vehicles are visible in the opposing lanes, with at least one car making a turn. While these vehicles do not directly impact the ego car's path, they require monitoring in case of unexpected behavior.\n\nA cyclist is also present to the left of the frame, riding alongside the vehicles.

Since the traffic light is green, proceed with caution, prioritizing safety and preparedness for any unpredictable movements from nearby road users. Be prepared for the traffic light potentially changing to yellow by observing the cross-traffic and the light's timer, if visible."
