This truck seems to have stopped, with its rear work platform extended into the adjacent lane, blocking my lane and partially obstructing the adjacent lane. This obstruction requires me to potentially change lanes or stop if the next lane is not free-flowing.\n\nSecondly, on the left side of the image, a white sedan is visible, positioned in the adjacent lane ahead of my vehicle, traveling in the opposite direction. The location and trajectory of this vehicle are crucial to monitoring, as they indicate the traffic flow and potential lane changes or turns that might be made.\n\nAdditionally, the rear of a commercial vehicle with warning markings obstructs the view directly ahead of my vehicle. This large vehicle may be stationary or moving slowly, obstructing potential hazards or changes in traffic ahead. I need to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to change lanes if necessary to ensure a clear view of the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or change lanes to the left when it is safe to do so, while also taking into account the traffic conditions in the adjacent lane and behind. Since there are no visible traffic signs or cones indicating a detour or lane merging, the lead vehicle must rely on real-time observation to navigate around the maintenance truck. If the adjacent lane is clear, the lead vehicle should signal and carefully merge into the lane to bypass the obstacle, while being mindful of any road workers who may be present but not visible in the current field of view. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, anticipate possible deceleration or stopping, and watch for any lane-changing or turning behaviors from the white sedan in the neighboring lane. Should traffic conditions change suddenly, such as the traffic light turning yellow or vehicles ahead intending to turn or brake, the lead vehicle should also be prepared to stop or adjust speed.",

Given its large size, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for slower acceleration and deceleration from the truck. The driver should also be cautious as the truck may obstruct visibility ahead and may make wide turns.",
