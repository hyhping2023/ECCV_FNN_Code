Its frontal bucket is raised and is carrying debris. Behind this construction vehicle, a truck is also visible, indicating that there is activity in the area. The presence of these construction vehicles can disrupt the normal flow of traffic as they occupy part of the roadway, necessitating other vehicles to navigate around them.\n\nAdditionally, there are no traffic lights visible in the current field of view. This means that the ego car must depend on road markings and the actions of other road users to make safe driving decisions.\n\nFurthermore, informal barriers such as concrete blocks and piles of rubble are present on the side of the road. These barriers denote a construction zone or road work area, suggesting that construction activities may be affecting road conditions and traffic patterns. Drivers are advised to proceed with caution due to these potential hazards."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle is visible, showing characteristics typical of heavy machinery used at construction sites. It appears to be a front loader, with a bucket attachment at the front for moving materials. For the ego car, maintaining a safe distance from this vehicle is crucial as such vehicles can make unpredictable movements and may have blind spots where the driver cannot see smaller vehicles. This large vehicle could potentially obstruct the road or cause debris to fall onto the roadway. Therefore, the ego car may need to reduce speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver safely around the construction vehicle.",

The size of the truck implies that it might take longer to accelerate and decelerate compared to regular passenger cars. The ego car should anticipate the possibility that the truck may move slowly, stop suddenly or take wide turns. It is important for the ego car to keep a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow traffic flow due to the size and operational behavior of the truck.",

If it becomes clear that the construction vehicle is crossing or entering the lane, the ego car should come to a full stop and wait for the vehicle to pass or for it to be safe to navigate around it. Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared to stop or slow down, and proceed with caution. Observe the surroundings for any construction signage or workers directing traffic. If necessary, safely navigate around the obstruction when there is a clear and safe opportunity to do so, being mindful of the oncoming traffic and any other roadwork hazards. Reduce speed to ensure adequate reaction time given the unpredictable nature of the current driving environment."
