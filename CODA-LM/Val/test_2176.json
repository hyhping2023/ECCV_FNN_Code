Notably, its brake lights are illuminated, signifying a reduction in speed or a complete stop. The presence and actions of this vehicle are critical for the ego car's navigation decisions. Specifically, it necessitates adjustments in the ego car's following distance and speed to safely respond to the potential changes in the leading vehicle's movement. The activation of the brake lights serves as a key signal for the ego car, indicating the need to closely monitor the vehicle's speed and readiness to alter its own speed or stop in correspondence."

It is not common on major roads, particularly at night, and can be unexpected in such environments. The presence of a tricycle on the road ahead requires the ego car's driver to exercise caution, reduce speed, and prepare to potentially change lanes or stop if necessary to avoid a collision and ensure the safety of all parties involved.",
