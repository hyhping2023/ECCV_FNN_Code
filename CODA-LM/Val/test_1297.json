        "description and explanation": "The traffic image displays several critical elements that could affect driving behavior. On the right side of the street, there are multiple cars parked, which, while not posing a direct risk, limit the available road width for navigation. Also, concrete barriers visible on the left restrict the navigable road space even further, compelling the vehicle to stay right to avoid potential collisions. Additionally, the presence of street lights offers minimal illumination, indicating a road that is maintained but suggests that drivers should proceed with caution due to the reduced visibility. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and traffic cones are not represented in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility and narrow roads caused by parked cars and obstacles, please drive with caution. Maintain a slower speed to cope with potential hazards that may be difficult to see in the dark. Stay to the right to deal with the limited space caused by obstructions on the left. Use your vehicle's headlights if there is no oncoming traffic, and if possible, use high beams to improve visibility. Stay alert for pedestrians or other vulnerable road users who may suddenly appear, as such situations are likely to occur in residential-like areas. Due to the extremely low visibility of this nighttime scene, where apparent road users or traffic control devices are not visible in the imagery, self-driving cars should reduce speed and increase following distance to maximize reaction time. Self-driving cars should turn on their headlights and, if available, use high beams (considering local regulations and ensuring they do not blind oncoming traffic) to better illuminate the road ahead. If unexpected obstacles or road users are detected, self-driving cars should also be prepared to stop or maneuver safely. Properly use the vehicle's lighting to improve visibility and signal to other potential road users not observed in the imagery. Ensure all vehicle sensing and safety systems are operational to assist in detecting and responding to any unforeseen obstacles or road users.",
