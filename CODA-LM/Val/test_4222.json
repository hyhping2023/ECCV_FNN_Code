Its taillights are illuminated, suggesting it might be running or not completely turned off. The visibility is low due to nighttime conditions. This scenario requires the autonomous vehicle to be cautious, ensuring no oncoming traffic is present when potentially swerving to avoid the parked car, and to be vigilant for any signs of movement around the car, like passengers exiting that might step onto the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a reflective traffic sign visible on the right. It seems to be a speed limit sign or another regulatory sign, and while there is another sign further away, it is less distinct. The vehicle must identify these signs as it gets closer to adhere to any limitations or warnings they may present, which could affect the vehicle's speed or which lane to use.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

Pay attention to parked vehicles and be prepared to appropriately adjust your lane position after confirming there are no oncoming vehicles. Be ready to respond to any unpredictable actions near parked vehicles. When approaching traffic signs, adjust your behavior according to the regulations or warnings indicated by the signs. In the absence of visible traffic signs or signals, please continue to exercise the usual caution and adhere to road conditions and standard traffic rules.",
