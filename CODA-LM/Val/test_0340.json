Exercise caution due to the presence of construction obstacles that may indicate road work or changes in road layout. Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front, adjust your speed according to visible speed limit signs, and carefully navigate the reduced lane space caused by obstacles. Stay alert to any additional traffic signs or changes in traffic flow. Considering nighttime conditions and the potential proximity to construction sites, it is advisable to reduce speed and heighten alertness to respond to unforeseen events.",

It serves the purpose to guide vehicles and prevent them from entering restricted or dangerous areas. In the driving scenario, the barrier should alert the ego car to stay within the designated lane, possibly indicating road work or lane closures ahead. The ego car must adjust its driving behavior to ensure it does not breach the barriers, maintaining a safe distance and speed and preparing for potential changes in traffic patterns.",

Its bright colors and reflective surfaces are designed to be highly visible to drivers, even in low-light conditions. The presence of this barrier indicates that the ego car must stay within the limits of the open lane and not cross into the area that is blocked off for safety reasons. The ego car will need to maintain a safe speed and be prepared for potential changes in traffic patterns or unexpected obstacles due to the construction work taking place.",
