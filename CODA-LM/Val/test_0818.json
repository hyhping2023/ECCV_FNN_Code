        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are two significant vehicular presences on the road affecting driving conditions.\n\nFirst, there is an oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane with its headlights on, driving towards the ego car. Drivers must exercise caution in this situation, especially at nighttime, as the glare from the vehicle's headlights can reduce visibility and affect driving safety.\n\nSecondly, there is a large truck or bus parked on the right side of the road with its lights on, indicating either activity within the vehicle or the unloading of passengers or goods. The positioning of this large vehicle by the roadside diminishes both visibility and the available width of the road for the ego car, thus demanding additional care when maneuvering past this potential hazard."

It is important to maintain a safe distance from such vehicles, as they often make sudden movements and may have reduced visibility. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include increased alertness, reduced speed, and readiness to adjust the driving path to avoid the vehicle's operation zone.",

Exercise caution when approaching the parked vehicle, reduce speed, and be alert for any movement indicating a road user might emerge from between the parked cars. Due to the wet or glossy road conditions, the ego car should reduce speed to ensure it has adequate stopping distance and to maintain control of the vehicle. Dim the headlights when the oncoming vehicle is approaching closely to avoid glaring the other driver."
