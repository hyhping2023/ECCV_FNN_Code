        "description and explanation": "In the scene ahead, there is a black sedan traveling in the right lane in the same direction as our autonomous vehicle. The importance of this sedan is that it mandates the need to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to adjust to any changes in the sedan's speed or lane position. At the intersection ahead, a yellow construction truck with a yellow excavator is parked off to the left. Due to the truck's stationary nature and its cargo, it serves as an indication of potential road work in the area, meaning our car must remain vigilant for any construction-related obstacles or activities that could impact its route.\n\nAdditionally, the intersection ahead is regulated by a red \"Do Not Enter\" sign aligned with the far right lane, clearly stating that vehicles, including ours, are not to enter those lanes, thereby requiring navigation to an appropriate lane to safely traverse the intersection. Further commanding attention is the traffic light at the intersection that is currently red, signaling that our vehicle should prepare to stop.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or barriers present in this scene, there are several standard road facilities like lampposts and traffic signal poles which are part of the road infrastructure. These structures typically do not have a direct influence on the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior but are fundamental components of the overall road environment. Notably, there is a red tent-like structure on the right side of the intersection. While this structure doesn't directly affect the traffic flow, it's crucial for our vehicle to monitor any movement around it, which could signal the presence of road workers or other unexpected events that might necessitate heightened attention or changes to driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to come to a complete stop at the red light, whilst maintaining a safe distance from the black sedan ahead. Additionally, our vehicle should be alert to potential detours or lane changes due to construction, which is indicated by parked trucks and roadblocks. Obey \"Do Not Enter\" signs at intersections and avoid attempting to enter restricted lanes. Watch for movements of construction vehicles, and be ready to adjust speed or direction in response to their actions. Stay vigilant for any situations that may arise near the red tent-like structures on the right.",
