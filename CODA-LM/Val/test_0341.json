Its position and trajectory could affect the ego car's ability to change lanes or it could merge into the ego car's lane. The ego vehicle needs to be prepared to react as the sedan may slow down or stop. Additionally, a red truck is directly in front of the ego car in the same lane. This truck dictates the speed and following distance of the ego car. Since trucks can obscure the road ahead, extra following distance is necessary and the ego vehicle needs to keep a safe distance due to the truck's potentially longer stopping distances and unpredictable movements.\n\nNo vulnerable road users are present in the image.\n\nThere are no visible traffic signs that impact immediate driving decisions for the ego vehicle, meaning no action is required regarding traffic signs at this moment.\n\nA traffic light visible ahead shows a green light for the direction the ego vehicle is following. This indicates the ego vehicle can proceed if the path is clear, but it should remain alert as the traffic light could change.\n\nNo traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are seen in the image."

Continue moving forward as the traffic light is green, but stay cautious and ready to adjust speed in response to changing traffic conditions and potential red light ahead. Monitor the truck's intentions through indicators or brake lights for any sudden changes in its driving behavior. Keep an eye on the sedan to the left in case it decides to merge into the ego car's lane. Continue to obey the traffic light and monitor it for any color change which would require a prompt response. Stay in the current lane, as the road ahead is clear and there are no immediate obstructions or reasons to change the driving pattern."
