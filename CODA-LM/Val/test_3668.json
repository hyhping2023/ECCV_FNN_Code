Maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles to allow room for maneuvering if anyone steps out from behind the vehicle or if it starts moving unexpectedly. Additionally, the vehicle should prepare to safely navigate around the improperly parked three-wheeled vehicle on the right, paying attention to the open dustbin and ensuring not to enter the pedestrian zone marked by the barriers. The driver must be prepared for sudden movements from the pedestrians and any other unexpected obstacles. The ego vehicle should also be prepared to change lanes to the left if the lane ahead remains obstructed by the stationary three-wheeled vehicle, after ensuring it is safe to do so."
