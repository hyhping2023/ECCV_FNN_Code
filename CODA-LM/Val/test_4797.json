However, there is a large animal, possibly a dog, on the left side of the road ahead of the ego vehicle. The dog appears to be in mid-stride as though it is moving across the road. This animal presents a potential hazard as it may unpredictably enter the path of the ego vehicle, requiring careful monitoring and potential evasive action.\n\nAdditionally, there is glare evident in the image that may be stemming from streetlights or reflections. This glare could impair the visibility of the driver or the imaging sensors equipped on an autonomous vehicle. As a result, the glare has the potential to diminish the effectiveness of detecting other road users or changes in road conditions, making it a noteworthy factor for driving behavior considerations."
