However, there is one notable observation in the category of 'other objects'. The object of interest is a large industrial cable reel situated on the left side of the image, either by the roadside or within a storage area. There's an individual near the reel who seems to be either inspecting it or performing some operation. While these cable reels are not positioned on the roadway itself, their proximity to the roadside might pose a distraction to drivers. It may also indicate ongoing work in the vicinity, which could be relevant to the driving conditions."
