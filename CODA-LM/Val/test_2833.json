The car is dark in color, and there is no visible activity inside or around it. The presence of this parked car necessitates increased vigilance from the ego vehicle, as it may have to adjust its course to maintain a safe distance due to the reduction in the usable width of the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pile of rubbish along with a green dustbin, located on the right side of the ego vehicle's path and partially on the roadway. These objects serve as potential hazards as they obstruct part of the driving lane. The ego vehicle will need to navigate carefully to avoid these obstacles. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the current traffic image."
