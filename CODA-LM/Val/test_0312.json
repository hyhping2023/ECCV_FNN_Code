        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements to note regarding the road users and environment. Firstly, the scene includes a white van positioned on the left lane, on the far left side of the image, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The proximity of this van in the adjacent lane requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any potential maneuvers the van might make. Additionally, there are several cars visible in the distance across the lanes, also moving in the same direction as the ego car, indicating flowing traffic. The ego car must remain alert to the conditions and any changes in the flow of traffic. Moreover, passenger cars are noticed in the distance on both sides of the road, moving away from the ego car, which helps in predicting the traffic flow and potential hazards.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users identified in this scene, thus no action or considerations regarding them are required.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, directional signs are visible above the roadway towards the top right corner, indicating lane destinations such as 'Lanzhu East Path', 'Danzi Blvd', and 'Qingsong West Rd'. These signs are crucial for the ego car to be aware of upcoming road junctions or points of interest and to ensure it is in the correct lane well in advance if intending to follow these routes.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene are green and located directly ahead on the other side of the intersection, indicating that the ego car has the right of way to proceed. However, vigilance is advised for the ego car to monitor for any road users who may disregard the red light and for any sudden changes in the light status.\n\nTwo striped traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the right-most lane, potentially indicating road hazards or work ahead. It is advised that the ego car avoids the cone-marked area for safety reasons.\n\nLastly, long stretches of gray metal barriers are on both sides of the road, delineating the separation between the roadway and sidewalks or other areas. These barriers signify a designated safe boundary for the ego car, emphasizing the importance of staying within the road confines.\n\nNo other objects of significance that could impact driving behavior are observed in this scene."

Prepare to navigate the intersection according to the ego car's desired route, paying close attention to the directional signs to ensure being in the correct lane. Additionally, keep a watchful eye on the traffic lights to ensure they remain green while approaching. Avoid the marked area where the traffic cones are placed, as this could represent potential hazards or road work. Maintain a safe distance from the white van ahead, observe the green traffic light while being prepared to stop if it changes, follow the directional signs to stay in the appropriate lane, and avoid the area marked by traffic cones. Monitor the road conditions and adhere to the lane markings. Maintain a steady speed while following the traffic ahead, stay vigilant for any changes in the traffic signal and prepare to respond accordingly. Stay in the lane unless a lane change is necessary due to the traffic cones indicating a potential lane closure. Continue following directional signs for navigational purposes."
