        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several road users are actively and passively influencing the driving environment:\n\n1. **Vehicles**:\n   - A large truck, loaded with various items and driving in the same direction and lane as our vehicle, has limited maneuverability due to its size. This could potentially obstruct the driver's view or cause sudden movements that necessitate driving adjustments.\n   - A silver minivan is parked on the right side facing the same direction. While it currently doesn’t pose an immediate threat, its potential movement or the disembarking of passengers calls for caution.\n   - Multiple cars are parked in a designated area on the left. These vehicles are stationary and do not directly obstruct our vehicle’s path but should be observed for any sudden departures.\n   - A white sedan waits in a left-turn lane facing the opposite direction, posing no immediate threat but potentially affecting visibility for oncoming traffic.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Pedestrians are present on the left sidewalk. They are not on the road yet, but their possible sudden crossing necessitates constant vigilance, requiring vehicles to stay prepared to halt.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A blue sign on the right warns of vehicles potentially entering and exiting the road ahead, suggesting a need for decreased speed and readiness to stop.\n\nGiven this traffic setup, the autonomous driving system should remain alert, accommodating for possible sudden movements of the vehicles and pedestrians, and abide by the indications of traffic signs to ensure safe navigation through the area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, as it may suddenly stop and block the lane. If the van intends to merge into the traffic flow, adjust your speed or change lanes safely when necessary. Be prepared to yield to pedestrians who may cross the street, and comply with pedestrian crossing signs. Considering the presence of the truck, the van parked by the roadside, pedestrians on the sidewalk, and wet road conditions, your vehicle should keep a safe distance behind the truck, monitor the movements of pedestrians, be ready to stop safely at crosswalks to let pedestrians pass, and drive at a speed suitable for wet road conditions. Pay attention to any signs that the parked van may move into the lane. Overall, your vehicle should be guided by the principle of caution and readiness to respond to the actions of other road users. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, be prepared to slow down when approaching crosswalks, and watch for any signs of pedestrians from the sidewalk entering the lane. Your vehicle should stay in the right lane but be ready to adjust your position appropriately to safely overtake parked vans while maintaining an adequate gap.",

Its presence on the road influences the driving behavior as the ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slowdowns or stops due to construction activities. Drivers should also be aware of any roadwork signs or signals that could indicate changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures that require merging.",
