        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, we observe several road users, primarily vehicles, with no other road features or users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, lights, cones, barriers, or other objects present.\n\nThe vehicles observed include:\n\n1. A black forklift, which is positioned to the left of our autonomous vehicle. It appears to be either stationary or moving at a slow pace, angled in a manner suggesting it might be turning or possibly merging with the flow of traffic. The placement and orientation necessitate caution on our part. The forklift may pose as an obstacle or could potentially move into our vehicle's path, requiring vigilant monitoring and possibly necessitating adjustments in our driving behavior to ensure safety.\n\n2. A white SUV positioned slightly ahead and to the right of our vehicle. It is either stationary or navigating the road at a very low speed in the same direction as our vehicle. Due to its current state, there's a likelihood that it may either merge into our lane unexpectedly or someone may open its doors onto our lane. This scenario demands our vehicle to keep a close eye on the SUV and be prepared for any sudden movements or changes that could affect our driving path.\n\n3. A large trailer truck is observed further up the road, transporting machinery. This truck, by virtue of its size, occupies a significant portion of the lane. The presence of such a large vehicle on the road necessitates that our vehicle ensures there is ample space when attempting to overtake, to prevent any close encounters or accidents. \n\nThese descriptions and explanations shed light on the dynamic and nuanced environment the autonomous vehicle finds itself in, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring of surrounding vehicles and adjusting driving behaviors accordingly to uphold safety standards."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead and stay alert to its dynamic changes. At the same time, pay close attention to any signs of the white SUV entering the lane or opening doors. When driving, maintain a cautious speed to ensure sufficient reaction time and situational awareness in response to the continuously changing traffic environment. Your vehicle should also keep a safe distance from the forklift on the front left to ensure both vehicles can pass safely without collision risk. Moreover, when passing the parked SUV, be aware and observe any indications of vehicle activity or obstacles that may impede your driving path. Slowing down and enhancing situational awareness around the parked SUV would be wise. Your vehicle should also be vigilant for any unexpected obstacles or changes in road conditions. When overtaking the forklift, maintain a cautious speed and give enough space in case it starts moving. Be prepared to stop if necessary. Pay attention to changes in the speed or direction of the traffic ahead, and adjust your following distance accordingly to ensure a safe reaction time. Continuously monitor the situation as it evolves, adjusting your driving behavior in a timely manner if new information becomes available or the behavior of road users changes.",
