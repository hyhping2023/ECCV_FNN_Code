        "description and explanation": "In the scene ahead, there are a couple of vehicles and some construction-related barriers that the ego car needs to consider.\n\nFirstly, there's a white car parked on the side of the road ahead. It is stationary, without any brake or indicator lights on. While it's not moving or interrupting traffic flow, it does limit the available space for the ego vehicle to maneuver.\n\nSecondly, a white van is parked on the right side, facing away from the ego vehicle. Although it isn't moving at the moment, there is a potential risk that it could start driving or someone might exit the vehicle, which mandates that the ego vehicle keeps a safe distance and stay alert for any sudden movements.\n\nIn terms of barriers, an excavator arm extends out into the road from the right, partially blocking the lane. This obstruction will most likely require the ego car to alter its path, either by changing lanes or slowing down to navigate safely around the obstacle without incident.\n\nAdditionally, there is an excavator positioned close to the roadway. While it's not directly blocking the lane, its presence is a strong indicator of construction activities in the vicinity, suggesting that there might be debris and the likelihood of encountering unexpected obstacles. Such a scenario calls for the ego vehicle to possibly reduce speed and exercise caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car. The ego vehicle's driving behavior must take into account the stationary vehicles and construction barriers to ensure safe navigation through the area."

Given its size and the potential for movement, the ego car must maintain a safe distance to avoid any unexpected maneuvers by the excavator that could encroach on the roadway. If part of the excavator is extending into the road, the ego car will need to slow down or stop and wait for a clear passage or move around the obstruction cautiously when it is safe to do so.",

Prepare to navigate around the parked car while being aware of any potential movements from the construction excavator. Use low-beam headlights if not already on and watch for any signs of activity around the construction equipment, including workers that might not be immediately visible in the dark. Maintain a safe distance from the parked car as you pass to avoid any sudden doors opening or the car pulling out. Reduce speed and prepare to either stop or change lanes if necessary, ensuring no traffic is coming from the opposite direction. Use vehicle indicators to signal any lane changes to other road users and maintain vigilance for any unexpected movements from the parked van. The ego car should slow down and maintain a safe distance from the stationary car, be alert for any potential movement from it, and watch for signs of construction activity that could require navigation changes."
