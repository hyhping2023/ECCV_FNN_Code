There is a black vehicle parked on the right side of the road, partially on the sidewalk, near the pedestrian crossing. This vehicle may pose a potential hazard by obstructing the view for pedestrians trying to cross the road and may also impede the flow of traffic. \n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian walking towards this parked vehicle, on the road's right side, who appears to be approaching the parked car. The presence of this pedestrian near the roadway is a safety concern as they may enter the road, requiring the ego car to remain alert and possibly adjust its path to ensure safety.\n\nAhead of the ego car, a traffic light is visible on the image's left side, showing a green light. This permits the ego car to proceed through the intersection or continue driving along its route without interruption.\n\nOn the pedestrian crossing in front of the ego car, there are orange traffic cones placed in the middle of the road. These cones likely signify ongoing construction or road work, prompting a deviation from the normal traffic path, which the ego car needs to navigate around carefully.\n\nLastly, there are guardrails positioned on the road's right side that extend into the distance. These barriers indicate that the road shoulder is inaccessible in this section and that stopping or pulling over is not permissible in this area. \n\nThere are no relevant traffic signs or other objects impacting traffic in the provided image."
