This truck is blocking the right lane and could slow down traffic or cause merging into the left lane, which would impact the ego car's travel path.

Its presence means that the ego car should be cautious of potential road work ahead, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared to obey any posted signs or directions from road workers. Due to its size and the possibility that part of it might be obstructing the road, it is also important to check for any workers or obstacles before passing safely.",

It is significantly larger and longer than standard passenger vehicles, requiring extra caution when maneuvering around it. The ego car must take into account the limited visibility around such a large vehicle and keep a safe following distance, as trucks have larger blind spots and can take longer to stop. When passing, it is essential to ensure there is sufficient clear space ahead, as the truck's length makes it a longer maneuver.",
