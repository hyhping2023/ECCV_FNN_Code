This vehicle is maintaining its lane and does not pose a direct threat, but it still needs to be monitored for potential lane changes or other actions. Additionally, an orange maintenance truck is traveling in the same direction on the right lane, with the back of the truck bed piled with debris. Due to the risk of debris falling onto the road, it is important for the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to respond to sudden stops or obstacles that may arise from the truck's load.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a green arrow, indicating that vehicles have the right to proceed straight ahead. This provides a clear signal for the autonomous vehicle to continue with its intended path as directed by the arrow.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones and yellow warning signs placed in the center of the intersection, suggesting that there is construction or roadwork taking place. These objects serve as markers for potential hazard zones, and the autonomous vehicle should navigate carefully around them to avoid any incidents.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects present in the image that need to be considered in this scenario."
