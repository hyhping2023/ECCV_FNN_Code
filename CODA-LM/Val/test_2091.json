There is a large truck ahead in the same lane with its bed raised, indicating it may be in operation, which could block the lane or create unexpected obstacles. Several cars are lined up with their brake lights on, suggesting slow-moving or stopped traffic, necessitating readiness to brake and follow traffic flow. Directly in front of the subject vehicle is a dark-colored sedan with brake lights on, implying deceleration or stopping, requiring a safe following distance. A white truck is parked on the left side of the road, facing opposite the direction of travel and appearing stationary, though caution is still necessary. A light-colored sedan is located to the left of and slightly ahead of the dark-colored sedan, both traveling in the same direction, which could be a concern if either vehicle changes lanes or if traffic conditions impact their speed.\n\nPedestrians are observed near a roadside work area, some appearing to be workers, necessitating caution as they might enter the roadway. A motorcyclist is riding along the right lane, who may weave through traffic or change lanes, requiring close monitoring. Among the pedestrians on the left side of the road, one individual is nearly stepping onto the carriageway, posing a potential traffic impediment and requiring the vehicle to be ready to stop or take evasive action.\n\nTemporary yellow barriers are installed on the left side, indicating possible road construction or lane closure, suggesting potential traffic flow disruptions and the need for the vehicle to remain vigilant and possibly adjust lanes. Lastly, debris related to construction may be near the operational truck, which poses a danger and requires careful driving to avoid."
    },
    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, slow down due to the queue of stopped vehicles ahead and possible road construction, and be prepared to stop when necessary. Drivers must monitor the road users around them, especially pedestrians and motorcyclists, and be aware of bicycles that are directly in the vehicle's path. When it is safe, the vehicle should change lanes to pass bicycles and be mindful of large vehicles, as they may influence traffic behavior. Due to wet roads and reduced visibility, increased vigilance is needed, and drivers should be ready to adjust their driving according to the visible traffic lights at any moment. The driving system should also be alert to debris that may appear on the road due to work activities and safely navigate around any obstacles, including being ready to potentially merge into another lane. Lastly, the presence of trucks and other vehicles necessitates that the vehicle be prepared to respond to unexpected movements.",
