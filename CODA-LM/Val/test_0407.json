It appears to be a cement mixer truck, characterized by its cylindrical mixing drum at the rear, which is used to mix cement, sand, gravel, and water to form concrete. Given the size and purpose of this vehicle, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movements, as this type of vehicle often performs drop-offs or pickups at construction sites and may operate unpredictably in comparison to standard passenger vehicles.",

Follow the directional markings and be alert for any sudden movements from the truck or other road users."
