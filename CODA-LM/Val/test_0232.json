        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, the ego vehicle comes across multiple road users and objects that impact its driving decisions. Directly ahead, in the same lane, a black car is slightly offset to the right, signalling a potential move to park or slow down due to adjacent parked vehicles. This situation requires the ego vehicle to adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain safe driving conditions.\n\nOn both sides of the road, there are cyclists. A group on the right seems ready to cross the road, while others are sharing the lane with motor vehicles. These cyclists could influence the ego vehicleâ€™s speed and lane position, necessitating caution or a possible lane shift to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a pedestrian on the left side of the road, facing away and not actively crossing. While they are not currently a direct threat, the ego vehicle must keep watch for any sudden movements into the road.\n\nA traffic sign is also part of the visual landscape - a blue pedestrian crossing sign on the right, signalling a crosswalk ahead. The ego vehicle must be ready to halt for any pedestrians that may cross or prepare to cross.\n\nMoreover, red and white temporary barriers line the right edge of the road, marking the separation between the vehicle lane and areas used by pedestrians and parked bicycles. These barriers guide the ego vehicle to stay clear of zones designated for non-motorized use.\n\nFinally, parked bicycles on the right suggest a vicinity bustling with pedestrian and cyclist activity, urging the ego vehicle to drive with heightened alertness for any individuals that might enter the driving lane unexpectedly."
