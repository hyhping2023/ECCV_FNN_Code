Regularly check mirrors and be aware of any other road users that may be hidden in the surroundings or in blind spots. No immediate action is necessary apart from vigilance and preparedness to react. Due to the presence of the tractor, which could be operating at a slow speed, the ego car should prepare to reduce speed and follow the tractor at a safe distance. The ego car should also scan the environment for any oncoming traffic or for a safe opportunity to overtake the tractor. Overtaking should only be attempted if the opposing lane is clear and it's legal and safe to do so in the current road conditions. The ego car should slow down and prepare to stop or move slightly to the left if safe to do so, ensuring there is enough space to pass the tractor without risk. Overtaking should only be attempted if the tractor is stationary or moving away, and there is clear visibility ahead with no oncoming traffic. The lack of lane markings necessitates heightened awareness of the road edge and any potential oncoming traffic that may also be maneuvering around the tractor."
