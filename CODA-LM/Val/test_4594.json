        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario captured in the image is as follows:\n\nThere are several cars parked on the right side of the road, all perpendicular to the direction of traffic and mostly facing the direction of our vehicle. The presence of these parked vehicles effectively reduces the usable width of the driving lane, potentially causing obstructions for pedestrians and other road users who might be obscured from view.\n\nFurthermore, a black car is observed merging into the middle of our lane from the left side. The merging of this vehicle into the lane without ensuring adequate clearance or failing to adjust its speed or position appropriately introduces a risk of collision. This demands heightened awareness and readiness to react from our vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, several vehicles are present on the adjacent left lane traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Their movement and possible lane changes could impact our vehicle's ability to switch lanes smoothly. There might also be instances where these vehicles attempt to enter our lane, requiring our vehicle to be vigilant and possibly adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nIn terms of signage, there is a blue traffic information sign located in the distance on the right, positioned above the parking lot. This sign likely provides important information regarding upcoming road conditions or directions, which could influence the future routing decisions of our vehicle.\n\nOn the right edge of the sidewalk, near the parked vehicles, there are yellow and black traffic cones placed. These cones typically signal the presence of temporary road works or obstacles, leading to narrowed lanes. Such setups necessitate cautious and considerate driving to safely navigate the altered road conditions.\n\nThis summary encapsulates all the described road users and elements within the image, highlighting their implications on driving behavior and the necessary adjustments required from our vehicle to ensure safety and compliance with road conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Closely monitor the merging behavior of the black car, and be ready to adjust speed or lane position if necessary. Stay alert for potential movements from people or other vehicles behind parked cars. Maintain a safe distance from traffic cones, noting the potential hazards they may indicate. Follow the instructions or information on traffic signs, while keeping an eye on the overall traffic situation. This vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, prepared to deal with any obstacles that might be caused by vehicles parked on the right side, and continue to travel in the lane, unless directional signs indicate a route change. Overtaking should be done cautiously, taking into account the traffic situation in the left lane. Maintain a safe following distance from the SUV in front that is braking. Be prepared to respond to traffic flow changes that may result from roadwork indicated by traffic cones. Unless lane signs indicate a lane change to continue on the planned route, keep traveling in the current lane. Watch for any movements from vehicles parked on the right side, as they could affect traffic. Continue to monitor the surrounding traffic, drive carefully, and be ready to adjust based on the behavior of road users and any road signs.",
