This indicates it is responding to an emergency, necessitating that the ego car yield as per legal and safety protocols.\n  - A yellow construction vehicle (bulldozer) is in the same lane as the ego car, ahead and moving in the same direction. The construction vehicle is likely moving slower, so the ego car should be ready to slow down or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance. This vehicle could disrupt the traffic flow and make unexpected stops or turns in the construction area.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: \n  - A green directional sign with white text is visible on the right side of the road, providing lane directions or turns. This sign is essential for guiding lane usage and anticipating road configurations that the ego car needs to follow.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - A traffic light is showing a red signal for the lane that the ego car is in. The ego car must come to a complete stop and wait for the green light before proceeding to ensure compliance with traffic laws and safety.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: \n  - Red and white traffic cones form a line separating the construction zone on the right from the drivable lanes. These cones guide the ego car to stay in the correct lanes and alert it to the presence of road workers and equipment.\n\n- **Barriers**: \n  - Red temporary barriers are positioned on the right roadside, indicating construction or a closed-off area. Similar to the traffic cones, these barriers signal a potential detour or work zone ahead, necessitating careful navigation away from the usual path."
