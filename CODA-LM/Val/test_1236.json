        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two vehicles identified with specific details and implications for driving behavior. The first is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, positioned away from the ego vehicle. This parked car is considered a potential hazard that requires caution from the ego car, as it could unexpectedly enter the driving lane or have its doors open into the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is another vehicle with its headlights on, parked further ahead of the white sedan. This vehicle seems to be facing the ego car, indicating that it might be parked facing the opposite direction of traffic. The presence of such a vehicle parked in this manner constitutes a hazard due to the risk it poses if it were to start moving or if it were parked improperly. The ego car must remain vigilant for any sudden movements from this second vehicle. All other categories, including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, have no entries and, therefore, are not present in this traffic scene."

Since the vehicle is facing the ego car, it is either parked or positioned to move in the opposite direction of the ego car. The driver of the ego car should take note of the vehicle's positioning and lights, ensuring there's no movement from the vehicle that could indicate it is about to enter the roadway or cross the ego car's path. Proceeding with caution and readiness to stop or yield, particularly if the vehicle begins to move, would be a wise driving behavior.",

The headlights and any reflective surfaces should be used to spot any additional users or obstacles not immediately visible. Due to the limited visibility and presence of a vehicle potentially parked against traffic, the ego car should proceed with caution, lower its speed, and prepare to stop or maneuver with little notice. If needed, the ego car can illuminate the area with its high-beam lights to enhance visibility, ensuring it does not blind other drivers. Attention should be given to detect any unexpected movements of the parked vehicles or sudden appearance of other road users."
