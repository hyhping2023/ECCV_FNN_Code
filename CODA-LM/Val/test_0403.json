Maintaining a lower speed will allow for a safer reaction time if the pedestrian were to unexpectedly enter the roadway. The vehicle's headlights and street lighting should be used for better visibility, and the driver should be prepared to stop if necessary. Proceed with caution, particularly watching the pedestrian on the right side. Maintain a slow speed to be able to stop quickly if the pedestrian or their dog enters the road. Due to low visibility, turning on the appropriate headlights (if not already on) and staying alert for any unexpected obstacles that might be hard to see would be advisable. Since there are no visible lane markings or barriers, the ego car should be prepared for oncoming traffic potentially occupying any part of the road. The ego car should maintain a cautious speed given the wet road conditions, keep a safe distance from the parked car on the right, and be prepared to stop or slow down if the pedestrian with the dog becomes an active hazard by moving closer to or into the driving lane."
