The truck's size and position may obstruct the view ahead for the ego car, and it may start moving or make turns unexpectedly.

Due to the lack of clear information, it must be assumed that the road ahead has no special restrictions or warnings.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: No traffic lights are visible in the image, indicating there are no traffic lights influencing the driving behavior at this moment.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: Orange traffic cones are aligned on the right side, indicating some form of work or an obstacle ahead on the right side of the road. The cones are channeling traffic to the left, narrowing the available driving space.

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone often used for road traffic control or to delineate temporary traffic lanes. These cones are typically orange-colored for high visibility and may feature a reflective sleeve for better visibility during night or low light conditions. The traffic cone is generally made of plastic or rubber, which allows it to be lightweight yet sturdy enough to stay in place. In a driving scenario, traffic cones indicate areas that are off-limits to vehicular traffic, such as construction zones or accident scenes. Their presence signals the ego car to slow down, move over to an adjacent lane (if available), and proceed with caution to avoid the section of the road that is blocked or under maintenance.",

Also, keep to the right to avoid the section of the road marked by the traffic cones. Due to the large size of the truck ahead, be alert for any other road users or obstacles that could be obscured by it. Reduce speed if visibility of the road ahead becomes significantly restricted or if there are any indications of work or obstacles ahead not yet visible. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, be prepared to react if the truck slows down or stops, and stay within the lane boundaries, being mindful of the demarcated area by the traffic cones. Monitor the surrounding environment for any additional road users or signs that may affect travel. If overtaking is necessary, ensure it is done when it is safe and legal, considering whether the opposite lane becomes clear and if no oncoming traffic is present. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes if it is safe to do so, due to the truck's potential slow speed or stoppage and to navigate past the traffic cones."
