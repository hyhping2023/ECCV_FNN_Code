Given the state of the load on this truck, there is a risk of debris falling onto the roadway, which could pose a significant danger to the ego car and other road users. The truck appears to be a construction vehicle possibly losing part of its load, which poses a risk for the road surface condition, and could lead to material being deposited on the ego car if it follows too closely."

Additionally, the driver should be alert for any indications from the truck regarding its movements, such as brake lights or turn signals, and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. If the truck is stationary and it is safe and legal to do so, the car can consider changing lanes to bypass the truck. The driver must also remain vigilant for any traffic light that may come into view and be prepared to adhere to its signals. Regularly monitoring the space around and the stability of the truck's load is also advised. Increase following distance to avoid potential debris and maintain a safe stopping distance. Monitor the truck's load and be prepared to take evasive action if larger pieces begin to fall. If it is safe to do so, consider safely passing the truck to avoid any hazards from the falling debris."
