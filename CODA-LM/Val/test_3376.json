This dog could be a potential hazard as its unpredictable movements increase the risk of a collision. Additionally, there are blue construction barriers on both sides of the road. These barriers not only reduce visibility but also narrow the road, signaling the possibility of construction activity nearby, which could involve the presence of workers or unexpected changes in the road layout. There are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."
