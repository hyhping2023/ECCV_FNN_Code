This vehicle is positioned with its rear end facing towards the ego car and is indicated by multiple red lights as being stationary. This presence obstructs the pathway and potential maneuvering space, necessitating careful consideration for passing or stopping. The ego car may need to decelerate or stop entirely, depending on the available space in the adjacent lane for safe navigation.\n\nAdditionally, bright reflective lights from a traffic light are visible in the distance, but the current state (red, green, or yellow) is unclear from the image. This uncertainty necessitates that the ego car approach cautiously and be prepared to stop if the light is red.\n\nMoreover, high-intensity glare from lights, likely headlights or work lights, emanates from the right side of the scene. This glare may reduce visibility or temporarily blind drivers, complicating the detection of other road users or obstacles, and thereby increasing accident risk, particularly under the limited visibility conditions typical of nighttime."

The driver should watch for any sudden movements from the construction vehicle and other road users that might emerge around the vehicle. Due to low visibility conditions, the ego car should have its headlights on, use low beams to reduce glare for other drivers, and keep a watchful eye for any temporary traffic signs, workers, or unexpected obstacles."
