        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic situation, there is a dark-colored SUV stopped directly in front of the ego car within the same lane, which most likely is due to a red traffic light or traffic congestion ahead. The stopped state of this SUV directly influences the ego car's movement as it necessitates maintaining a suitable following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are directional traffic signs positioned on the right side of the road, indicating the available lanes for either making turns or driving straight. These signs provide necessary guidance to the ego vehicle for choosing the appropriate lane according to its intended travel route.\n\nThe traffic light itself is not visible in the image, but the presence of other stopped vehicles suggests that it is red. This implies that the ego car should remain stationary until the light turns green, indicating it is safe to proceed.\n\nOn the rightmost lane, there is a set of orange traffic cones arranged around a hole cover. These cones signify the presence of a hazard or road work, and they serve as a warning for the ego car to keep to the left, ensuring a safe margin from the cones.\n\nAmidst the traffic cones, one can notice a manhole cover and what appears to be a cable or wiring extending across the road surface. This presents a potential hazard, and the ego car must navigate with caution to avoid these obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, there is a digital road sign display near the traffic cones, likely providing information or warnings about current road conditions or upcoming road work, which may necessitate adjustments in the ego car’s speed or lane positioning.\n\nFinally, an electronic signboard is installed on the left side of the road, with text that seems to convey crucial traffic information. The sign’s content might include notices about detours, road work, or different traffic conditions, information that the ego car must factor into its driving decisions."

Additionally, the ego car should stay within its lane while avoiding the rightmost side where the traffic cones and wires are present, to prevent any potential damage or hazards. Use the lane indicators to anticipate the intended actions of vehicles ahead, and adjust speed and positioning accordingly when the traffic flow resumes. Maintain a safe following distance behind the black SUV, monitor the roadwork area indicated by the cones and be prepared for a potential lane change if the current lane becomes obstructed. Pay attention to the directional signs overhead to stay on the correct path, and observe the digital road sign for any additional instructions or warnings. Continue to monitor the road conditions and drive with caution, adapting speed and positioning as necessary for safe navigation through the area. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead and prepare to possibly slow down if it decelerates. Stay to the left to avoid the marked area by the cones. Pay attention to the electronic sign for any pertinent traffic information which may require action, such as lane changes or speed adjustments."
