This sedan's behavior and our distance from it are determining factors for the speed and lane choices our autonomous car may make.\n\nNext, we see a white sedan driving adjacent to the black sedan in the left lane, also heading in the same direction. Given the closeness and movement of the white sedan, it could influence our vehicle's decisions for lane changes or merging.\n\nAdditionally, several vehicles, including a truck and multiple white vans, are parked along the right side of the road. The presence of these parked vehicles narrows the available lane width and could potentially conceal pedestrians or other hazards that are not immediately visible.\n\nLastly, the road is partially obstructed by a series of red and white alternating traffic cones placed on the right side, effectively reducing the usable width of the lane. These cones suggest possible construction or roadwork ahead, signaling the need for our vehicle to slow down and possibly consider merging into the left lane if necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene that impact the driving behavior of our car."

Since the traffic cones indicate that the right lane might be closed, be prepared to merge left. Continue to monitor the traffic conditions that may change due to construction activities. Pay attention to the large truck parked on the right and maintain a safe distance.",
