        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scenario, the ego vehicle navigates a road with several considerations to keep in mind. There is a white sedan parked on the right side, reducing the available lane width and requiring careful driving when passing. The road ahead is populated by construction vehicles such as a crane and a road roller, indicating an active construction zone. This setup generally leads to narrower lanes and necessitates slower, more vigilant driving. Additionally, a large construction vehicle occupies the left of the road, further limiting navigable space.\n\nA cyclist dressed in a bright orange vest is also on the road to the left, traveling in the same direction as traffic. As they are vulnerable road users, the ego vehicle must give them extra space and be prepared for any sudden movements they may make.\n\nThe presence of multiple road work signs including 'Road Work Ahead', 'No Entry', and 'Keep Right' alerts drivers to forthcoming construction and instructs the ego vehicle to stay right and obey reduced speed limits, specifically 40 km/h in this area. A 'No Parking' sign is also visible, reinforcing that parking should only be in designated spaces.\n\nWhile there are no traffic lights present in the scene, traffic cones are arranged near the construction vehicles to the right, guiding traffic flow towards the left, away from the work area. This is supported by metal barriers alongside the sidewalk, clearly marking the construction zone limits, ensuring that the ego vehicle steers clear from it.\n\nOther objects include construction machinery and materials on the road and sidewalk, which could lead to sudden obstructions and demand slower speeds and increased attention. A dustbin is seen on the left sidewalk near the construction area, but it does not impact the driving scenario directly. \n\nOverall, the ego vehicle must drive with heightened caution, adhere to the reduced speed limit, and be vigilant of indications for lane changes or diversions while navigating through the congested construction area and considering the safety of road workers and the cyclist."

Anticipate potential stops or slow-moving traffic within the construction area. Proceed with caution due to the cyclist on the road and potential narrowed lanes ahead caused by the parked car and road work. Reduce speed as advised by the speed limit sign and in response to the wet road conditions. Prepare to merge left if necessary to safely pass the road work, while being attentive to other vehicles' actions around the construction zone. Maintain a safe distance from the cyclist and be ready to stop or adjust the path if the cyclist changes direction or the road conditions change suddenly."
