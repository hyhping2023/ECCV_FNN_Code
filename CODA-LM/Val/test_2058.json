The white SUV is currently not actively engaged in traffic, but if it were to suddenly join the flow, it could pose a potential hazard."

        "description and explanation": "In the scene observed, there are several road users and elements to take into account for autonomous driving. \n\nFirstly, there is a large truck with an open-top cargo bed traveling in front of our vehicle in the same direction. The significant size and load of the truck are essential considerations when determining a safe following distance due to its potential to obscure our view and risk of dropping debris.\n\nAlso on the road is a white SUV parked on the right side, facing the same direction as our vehicle. Our car must keep an appropriate lateral distance from the SUV as a safety precaution. The parked SUV may pose a risk of causing an accident if its doors were to open unexpectedly or if it decides to merge back into traffic without warning.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist located to the left and slightly ahead of our vehicle, traveling in the opposite direction. Extra vigilance is needed when interacting with motorcyclists due to their vulnerability and the necessity to be prepared for sudden lane changes or unexpected maneuvers.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that have been noted to affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, allowing ample reaction time and a clear view of the road conditions. Be vigilant of the white SUV parked on the right, and watch for any signs of it starting. At the same time, pay attention to the motorcycle on the left, give it extra space, and be prepared for any sudden lane changes or stops it may make. Due to the wet road surface, adjust your speed to ensure vehicle control and braking capability. Do not attempt to overtake unless it is safe, legal, and there is sufficient visibility.",

This type of vehicle often indicates construction work ahead or nearby, which may affect traffic flow. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include increased alertness and preparedness to slow down, as well as the possibility of lane closures or detours ahead due to construction activities. The driver should watch for additional signage or signals and be prepared to follow any temporary traffic directions or restrictions that might be in place.",
