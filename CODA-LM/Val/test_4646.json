        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene ahead, there is a white sedan occupying the left lane, moving further away from our vehicle. It's essential to monitor this vehicle closely to maintain a safe following distance, as well as to be prepared for any sudden turns or braking it might perform.\n\nAdditionally, the road is shared with several vulnerable users, including motorcyclists and cyclists, dispersed across various lanes. Their smaller size and unpredictable movement patterns necessitate increased vigilance to safely adjust our vehicle's speed and direction in response to their presence.\n\nNotably, from the current perspective, no traffic signs are evident, which means we must adhere to known road rules and base our driving behavior on standard practices until any road signs come into view. Similarly, no traffic lights are visible in the image, requiring the same default adherence to general road norms while remaining alert for any other signals or behaviors that might indicate the need for specific actions.\n\nLastly, a sizable industrial-grade mixer is positioned directly ahead of our vehicle, presumably attached. This object notably hinders visibility and could restrict the car's maneuverability. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise additional caution, especially during turns or lane changes, as this affects the dimensions of our own vehicle and limits the driver's field of vision."

The presence of a bus indicates that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance if it is behind the bus and be aware of potential stops or turns the bus may make, which could affect the flow of traffic. The ego car driver should also be cautious of passengers alighting from the bus, leading to potential pedestrian traffic near the bus.",
