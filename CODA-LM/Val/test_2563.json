Whilst this car appears to be stationary, given its proximity to the driving lane, it is essential for autonomous vehicles to keep a safe distance. This precaution is advised to mitigate any risks associated with potential unexpected movement or the opening of the car's doors, which could otherwise lead to accidents. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in the image that would influence the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the dim lighting and the presence of vulnerable road users, one's vehicle should reduce speed to allow for increased reaction time. Additionally, if the headlights are not on, they should be activated to improve visibility, and one should be prepared to stop or yield as necessary. The vehicle must be attentive to pedestrians who may intend to cross the street and anticipate that dogs might move suddenly. Furthermore, close attention should be paid to any activities involving vehicles parked by the roadside. When approaching traffic lights, the vehicle should also be ready to respond to potential changes in the signal and be prepared to stop at the intersection.",

The red signal indicates that vehicles must stop and wait before the intersection until the signal changes to green, which grants permission to proceed. The ego car must adhere to this signal by coming to a complete stop and not entering the intersection to ensure safety and compliance with traffic laws.",
