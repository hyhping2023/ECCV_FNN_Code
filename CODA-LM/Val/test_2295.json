        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, the ego car is presented with multiple road users and environmental signals that require attention. Directly ahead, there is a sedan with its brake lights on, indicating that it might be slowing down or has come to a stop. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this sedan and be ready to reduce speed or come to a stop if necessary. Additionally, the traffic ahead is congested, as signified by several vehicles in the same lane showing brake lights, indicating that traffic is either moving slowly or has formed into a queue. The ego car needs to be prepared for variations in traffic flow and adapt its speed to ensure a smooth and safe drive.\n\nFurthermore, there's a truck positioned ahead and slightly to the right of the ego car, only partially visible in the frame. This requires the ego car to be cautious of the distance to this truck and stay alert to any potential changes in lanes or speed that the truck may undertake.\n\nOn the right side of the lane, next to the ego car, there are road workers dressed in high-visibility clothing. This calls for a cautious approach from the ego car, with a heightened readiness for the possibility that the workers might step into its path.\n\nA distant red traffic light is seen, indicating the reason for the halted traffic ahead. This means the ego car must be ready to stop if the light remains red upon approach.\n\nThe traffic scene also includes traffic cones arranged in a manner that possibly indicates a shift in traffic flow or a work zone presence. This hints to the ego car to stay within its lane, approach with caution, and possibly at a lower speed than normal.\n\nLastly, there are temporary barriers located on the road's right side, likely signifying an active construction or work zone. These barriers signal to the ego car the importance of staying within lane limits and being vigilant for any sudden alterations in the traffic pattern or unexpected obstacles that may arise."

No lane changes should be made unless the traffic signs or markings indicate otherwise and it is safe to do so. The presence of workers and barriers suggests the need for vigilance, readiness to adjust speed, and following any temporary directions provided for navigating the work zone."
