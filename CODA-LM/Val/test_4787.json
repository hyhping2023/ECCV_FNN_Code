        "description and explanation": "The traffic image displays various road users and objects that significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego car. Predominantly, parked cars, both white in color, are noticed on both sides of the road. They are positioned in such a manner that they are either perpendicularly or parallel to the curb, effectively occupying potential parking spots along the street. The parked vehicles notably reduce the available road width, leading to a scenario where careful navigation around these vehicles is necessary, thereby potentially causing traffic congestion.\n\nIn addition to vehicles, there is a pedestrian observed walking on the right side of the road with their back towards the ego vehicle. The presence of a pedestrian in close proximity to moving traffic is inherently risky, necessitating the ego car to be prepared to either slow down or come to a stop to ensure the pedestrian's safety.\n\nThe traffic scenario further includes black traffic cones placed near the parked cars on the right side. These cones likely signal an area that should be avoided, possibly due to road work or obstructions. As a result, caution is advised, and a shift in the driving path of the ego car might be required to maintain a safe distance from these cones.\n\nAnother noteworthy object is a loose, deflated tire lying in the middle of the road, detached from any vehicle. This object poses a significant hazard as it could potentially cause the ego vehicle to swerve or stop abruptly. Therefore, it is crucial for the ego car to navigate safely around this obstacle without coming into contact with it.\n\nIn this traffic image, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present, making the previously mentioned objects and users the focal points in determining the ego vehicle's driving behavior in this specific scenario."
