The presence of parked cars necessitates that your vehicle maintains a safe distance to prevent any mishaps that could occur if car doors are suddenly opened or pedestrians emerge from between the parked vehicles unexpectedly. Additionally, there is a trash bin situated on the right side of the road, close to a streetlight pole. The proximity of these objects to the roadway adds to the visual complexity of the environment, requiring vehicles to proceed with caution on the chance that pedestrians might step out from behind these obstructions without warning. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility and slippery roads, please drive cautiously and reduce speed. Maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and stay alert in case they or pedestrians suddenly move. Obey lane markings and avoid crossing the central divider. This vehicle should keep a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, pay attention to their brake lights, and adjust speed or stop if necessary. Considering the slippery roads, increase the braking distance and slow down to prevent skidding. Drivers should also be aware of trash bins and lamp posts along the road to avoid unexpected obstacles.",
