        "description and explanation": "On the road, there is a gray sedan parked off to the right side, partially concealed by vegetation but still visible from the ego vehicle's direction of travel. While this vehicle is not actively on the road, it presents a potential hazard as someone may enter or exit the car, possibly intruding into the path of the ego vehicle. Thus, it requires monitoring for any sudden movements that could affect the flow of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be an object akin to debris or a cardboard box, which is situated flat on the road in the right lane, closer to the right edge. The presence of this object necessitates caution, as the ego vehicle may have to execute a slight left turn to circumvent it, provided that the adjacent lane is clear, or reduce speed to safely navigate past the obstruction if moving over is not possible."

As debris on the road, it could require the driver of the ego vehicle to make decisions like swerving to avoid it or slowing down, depending on the size and the potential damage it could cause. The presence of such objects on the road can lead to unpredictability in driving patterns and calls for increased driver attention to maintain safety.",
