It is partially merging or drifting towards the lane this vehicle is in, and seems to have activated its right turn signal (amber light is visible).",
                "explanation": "This truck is occupying the adjacent lane and has created large blind spots to its rear and to its side, meaning that our vehicle must maintain a safe distance and exercise caution when considering a lane change. The activated turn signal indicates an intention to move laterally, requiring our vehicle to adjust speed and position to avoid a collision."

Our vehicle should be prepared to slow down and maintain a safe following distance. Although the maintenance truck is close by, as long as it stays in its own lane, it will not pose a direct threat to our vehicle's driving trajectory."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario described by the JSON data, we are observing two distinct vehicles, while there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified.\n\nThe first vehicle is a red truck carrying a large shipping container. It is situated in the lane to our vehicle's left, traveling in the same direction as our car. Notably, the truck is in the process of possibly merging or drifting into the lane that our vehicle occupies. Its intention to shift lanes is signaled by an activated amber turn signal. Due to the truck's position, it creates significant blind spots directly behind and to its side. Consequently, our vehicle should maintain a prudent distance and proceed with caution before attempting any lane changes. We must be vigilant and ready to adjust our speed and positioning to evade any potential collision prompted by the truck's lateral movement.\n\nThe second vehicle is an orange, heavy-duty maintenance vehicle conspicuous by its rear warning signage. It is located ahead, slightly to the right within the same lane as our vehicle, and is currently showing no intention of changing lanes or turning. The mere presence of this maintenance vehicle hints towards possible roadwork or slower traffic ahead. It is advisable that our vehicle prepares to decelerate and keep a secure following distance. Given that the maintenance truck is maintaining its lane without any erratic maneuvers, it does not directly endanger our vehicle's navigation path."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the heavily loaded maintenance vehicle ahead. Be cautious of the large red truck in the adjacent lane-do not attempt to overtake unless the lane ahead is truly clear and safe. If road work or obstacles arise due to the maintenance vehicle, be prepared to decelerate further. Considering the circumstances, the vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the red truck ahead, especially given the truck might merge or change lanes. If necessary to allow the truck to merge safely, be prepared to slow down or change lanes. Continuously monitor the truck's position in order to respond appropriately to its maneuvers and maintain situational awareness for any sudden changes, including the behavior of utility trucks or other unforeseeable road users or situations. Given the close proximity to large vehicles and the uncertainty of traffic light statuses, it is advised to keep a safe distance from the truck ahead in the right lane, monitor the movements of the truck on the left, and be ready for any changes in traffic flow or signals, especially considering its hazardous cargo. The vehicle should also decelerate appropriately due to wet road surfaces to ensure sufficient stopping distance and prevent loss of vehicle control.",
