The headlights are reflected onto a snowy surface, indicating icy conditions. This parked vehicle narrows the drivable road space and could potentially obscure pedestrians or other obstacles from the ego car's view. There is also a concern that the parked car could pull out into traffic, requiring the ego car to remain vigilant.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic lights visible in the distance with blue lights illuminated. However, the blue lights are unusual and not standard traffic signal colors, which are typically red, yellow, or green. Further observation is necessary to determine their relevance to traffic control."

Its position, indicated by the visibility of its side profile and wheels turned away from the travel lane, suggests it is not currently moving. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe distance from the parked car to avoid any potential hazards, such as the car door opening or the car unexpectedly entering the travel lane. The ego car may need to slightly adjust its trajectory to maintain this safe distance while passing the stationary vehicle.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the poor visibility and potential slippery road conditions, the ego vehicle should have headlights and potentially fog lights on, if equipped, to increase visibility. The vehicle should also proceed with caution, at a reduced speed, and maintain an increased following distance to account for reduced traction and increased stopping distances. If the parked car shows any indication of movement, such as brake lights or turn signals, the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or yield the right-of-way. Maintain a cautious speed and ensure a greater stopping distance due to potentially slippery road conditions. Be prepared to adjust course for the parked vehicle, allowing a safe passage without entering the opposite lane. Observe the traffic lights for further cues when approaching; if necessary, slow down to understand their function and any required response. Monitor for any additional road users that may be obscured by the parked vehicle or low visibility. Reduce speed to accommodate the reduced traction on the snow-covered road. Increase following distance to allow for increased stopping distances in icy conditions. Use low-beam headlights to improve visibility and avoid glare. Proceed with caution around the parked vehicle, watching for any hidden hazards it may be obscuring, including pedestrians or debris on the road."
