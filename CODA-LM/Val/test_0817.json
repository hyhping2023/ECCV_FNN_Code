This construction vehicle is taking up most of the lane width and therefore affects the driving behavior of the ego car. The ego car will need to ensure a safe following distance from this vehicle and may need to reduce its speed to match the speed of the construction vehicle ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a speed limit sign posted next to the road indicating that vehicles should not exceed 40 km/h, paired with a directional sign featuring an upward arrow. This configuration suggests there may be merging traffic or the route continues straight on. The implied instruction for the ego car is to adhere to the speed limit and be mindful of possible incoming vehicles from the right.\n\nFinally, guardrails are seen on both sides of the road, serving as barriers that restrict lateral movement on the roadway. This means that the maneuverability of the ego car is limited, and it cannot move freely around potential obstacles that may appear on the road.\n\nNo other road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the scenario."

Additionally, be aware of the potential for other vehicles merging from the right and prepare to adjust position if necessary, while monitoring the construction vehicle's speed and signals for any sudden stops or turns. Considering the construction vehicle ahead, the ego vehicle should prepare to either slow down or change lanes to the left if safe to do so. It must also remain aware of the potential exit, ensuring not to miss any intended turns."
