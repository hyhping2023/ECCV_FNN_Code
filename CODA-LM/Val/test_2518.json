They are dressed in dark clothing and their light source is only able to partially illuminate their immediate vicinity. The presence and movement of this pedestrian are critical for the ego vehicle to consider, as they present a potential hazard. The autonomous driving system of the ego car must be ready to decelerate or come to a stop if necessary to guarantee the pedestrian's safety, especially given the compromised visibility.\n\nAdditionally, the light reflections and light sources from other vehicles or streetlights add to the complexity of the driving scenario without posing any immediate hazards. These may further challenge the vehicle's perception systems due to the low visibility environment. There are no other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present that need to be accounted for in this specific scene."

The car should continue at a low speed and monitor for any additional pedestrians or obstacles that may not be immediately visible due to the poor lighting conditions. Proceed with caution at a reduced speed while maintaining a vigilant watch for the pedestrian and any other potential obstacles that may arise due to the low-light conditions. Be prepared to adjust the trajectory if the pedestrian moves into the path of the vehicle. Use vehicle headlights appropriately to enhance visibility. Reduce speed and increase following distance due to wet or icy road conditions. Be prepared to stop or maneuver gently to avoid any unsafe interaction with the pedestrian, while ensuring to maintain a safe buffer zone. As visibility is low, make sure the vehicle's headlights and taillights are functioning properly to alert the pedestrian and other road users of the ego vehicle's presence."
