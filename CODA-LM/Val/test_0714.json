        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several notable features. \n\nConcerning vehicles, there is a light commercial vehicle parked on the left side of the road, facing the same direction as our vehicle, which is not expected to affect our path as it remains stationary. Meanwhile, a red passenger car is also parked but on the right side of the road, facing our vehicle. Although this vehicle is not moving, it should be carefully monitored for any signs of movement as we drive past.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user present: a pedestrian clad in a blue jacket who is walking a dog across the road from right to left directly in front of the self-driving vehicle. This situation requires the autonomous vehicle to yield or stop to allow the pedestrian and dog to cross safely.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones are reported in this scene.\n\nTwo forms of barriers have been observed. An iron gate is seen on the right side of the road, which obstructs direct access to the area behind it, signifying restricted access that may influence other road users. Additionally, a fence is noticed next to the right-side parking space, which sets the boundaries of the driveable area and instructs the vehicle to stay within the road's navigable space.\n\nOther objects identified include several large waste containers situated on the right side that may conceal other road users, necessitating cautious driving to prevent potential surprises. On the left, large trash bins are present near the corner of a truck and a building, posing similar challenges in visibility, particularly for spotting smaller individuals such as children."

    "driving_suggestion": "If the vehicle has not stopped, it should halt to ensure the safe passage of pedestrians and dogs. Once the pedestrians have cleared the vehicle's path, the vehicle should proceed cautiously, paying attention to any signs of movement from parked vehicles, and remain alert to the narrowing of space caused by obstacles and trash containers. In this crowded area, always maintain a low speed and be prepared to stop at any moment. This will reduce risk and enhance the safety of all road users.",
