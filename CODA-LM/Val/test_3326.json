Its size and potentially slower speed may affect the ego vehicle's driving speed and require the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance or consider overtaking if safe to do so. Being a heavy vehicle, it may accelerate or decelerate more slowly than smaller vehicles.\n   \n2. **White Bus:** Positioned on the right side, parallel to the ego vehicle, also in motion and sharing the road. This bus may make stops to pick up or drop off passengers, potentially slowing down or stopping abruptly, which can affect the lane choices of the ego vehicle, especially if the ego vehicle needs to change lanes or if the bus moves into the ego vehicle's lane.\n   \n3. **Various Other Vehicles:** Including a blue car in the adjacent lane to the left and a scooter between lanes. The presence of these vehicles in neighboring lanes requires careful monitoring in case they change lanes or slow down. The presence of oncoming traffic in the opposite lane can affect the ego vehicle's decisions about overtaking.\n   \n4. **Blue Sedan:** Located on the opposite side of the road, facing toward the ego vehicle, indicating two-way traffic.

Vulnerable road users such as pedestrians near or on the road can create unpredictable situations, necessitating caution and readiness to stop.\n\n### Barriers:\n1. **Metal Barrier on the Right Side:** This barrier creates a physical boundary between the road and the sidewalk, with a pedestrian just behind it. It dictates lane boundaries and movement patterns for the ego vehicle, especially concerning the proximity of the pedestrian.\n   \n2. **Pedestrian Barrier on the Right Side:** Separates the sidewalk from the road, reducing the likelihood of a pedestrian-related incident by preventing any pedestrian from accidentally stepping into the roadway.\n\n### Other Objects:\n1. **Barrier on the Right Side:** Separates the road from the sidewalk where a pedestrian is walking.
