        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, various elements with potential influence on the ego vehicle's driving decisions are identified. A large truck is present, obstructing most of the lane ahead and is likely a construction or maintenance vehicle. The ego vehicle will need to alter its lane or speed to maneuver safely around the truck if the adjacent lane is free. In addition, a green bus is partially in the ego carâ€™s lane to the left, signaling potential stops or speed reductions, impacting overall traffic flow. There's also a bus in the opposite lane moving away from the ego vehicle, implying the possibility of nearby pedestrian activity linked to a bus stop.\n\nFurthermore, an overhead traffic sign structure is visible but doesn't show any information at the moment, so it's an element to watch for future advisories. Placed after the large vehicle on the road are multiple traffic cones on the right, suggesting road work and a potential lane merger. It requires careful driving from the ego vehicle. Lastly, barriers are observed on the left side of the ego car's lane, indicating road work or a lane closure and ensure the ego car stays within the lane's limits.\n\nNo traffic lights or other objects are considering in the image."

Additionally, maintain a safe following distance from the truck to provide ample time to react to any unexpected movements or stops. The ego car should also ensure its lights are on if needed to be visible to other road users."
