Due to its size and operational function, this vehicle may move slower than the regular traffic flow and may also make frequent stops or maneuvers that are unexpected to other road users.

Monitor the white car in the adjacent lane for any lane-changing behavior, and be ready to adjust speed or position accordingly. Drive cautiously due to the wet road conditions, reducing speed to ensure safe braking and handling. Remain in the current lane as the 'No Entry' sign indicates a prohibition for a direction not applicable to the ego car. Keep an eye on the overhead road sign once closer for any pertinent navigation information."
