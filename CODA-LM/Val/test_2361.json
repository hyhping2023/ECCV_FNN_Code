If passing the cyclist, ensure there is enough clearance space to do so safely, and be prepared for potential movements from them. Clean the windshield at the earliest opportunity to improve visibility. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the cyclist and be prepared to slow down or stop if the cyclist makes any unexpected movements. The vehicle should also reduce speed appropriately due to the reduced visibility from the weather conditions and continue to monitor the environment for any other potential hazards."
