This influences the ego car's speed and requires maintaining a safe following distance and adjusting speed according to the truck's actions.\n\nThere are concrete barriers on the left of the ego car demarcating the edge of the lane and indicating the start of a construction or protected area. These barriers restrict lane-changing options to the left. Additionally, concrete barriers are present on the right side of the truck, delineating the boundary of the lane and constraining the driving space on the right, preventing overtaking from that side. A continuous metal barrier is also on the left side of the road, preventing access or crossing into oncoming traffic and ensuring unidirectional traffic flow, making overtaking or evasive maneuvers to the left impossible."

Since there is no immediate indication of whether the truck will turn or change lanes, keep a constant watch on its brake lights and indicators. The presence of barriers and the absence of visible road signs or traffic lights suggest that the road conditions are stable and the ego car can continue driving with normal caution. Overtaking should not be considered at this moment due to the concrete barriers to the right and the following curve. Stay attentive to any changes in speed or direction of the truck, and remain within the lane while navigating the curve ahead."
