        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, several categories of road users and objects affect driving behavior:\n\n**Vehicles**:\n1. **Parked Cars and Motorcycles**: On the right side of the road, a row of cars is parked parallel to the direction of traffic. Additionally, a few motorcycles are parked next to these cars, occupying extra space along the curb. These parked vehicles reduce the width of the drivable road surface, potentially obstructing pedestrians or other road users who might suddenly enter the traffic flow.\n2. **White Car in Opposite Lane**: A white car is approaching from the opposite lane in the distance, with other vehicles ahead. Without lane markings, this car could perform unexpected maneuvers, so it must be monitored to avoid sudden actions.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users**:\n1. **Pedestrians**: Pedestrians are walking parallel to the direction of driving on the right side of the road, with one person crossing the street ahead. These pedestrians pose a risk of suddenly walking onto the road, and the vehicle needs to yield or stop to ensure their safety.\n2. **Cyclist**: A cyclist is moving in the same direction as the traffic, positioned in front of the vehicle. The vehicle must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden changes in the cyclist's direction or speed.\n3. **Puppy**: A puppy is crossing the road in front of the car. The vehicle must slow down and be prepared to stop to avoid a collision, as dogs may suddenly run or stop in the vehicle's path.\n\n**Traffic Signs**:\n1. **Directional Signs**: Signs indicating lane directions and possible road exits are installed at a high position in the distance. These signs provide crucial information for lane selection and navigation decisions.\n\n**Barriers**:\n1. **Metal Fence**: A metal fence extends along the left side of the road, separating the opposite lanes. This barrier limits the vehicle's ability to make left turns or overtake using the opposite lane, ensuring it stays in the right lane and remains mindful of oncoming traffic.\n\n**Other Objects**:\n1. **Street Stalls and Vehicles**: The roadside is lined with street stalls and vehicles, which may attract pedestrian activity. Increased pedestrian activity in these areas can affect road safety and traffic flow."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed to ensure sufficient reaction time in case pedestrians suddenly step onto the road. Be prepared to stop for pedestrians crossing the street. Keep a safe distance from cyclists, and if the left lane is clear and safe, be ready to overtake with caution. Watch for any movement from vehicles and motorcycles parked on the right, as this may indicate that a vehicle is preparing to merge into traffic. Drive according to the traffic signs to deal with the upcoming road layout. Slow down for small dogs crossing the road and be prepared to stop if necessary. Keep a safe following distance from motorcycles and tricycles ahead. Be mindful of pedestrians on the right and be careful of obstacles that may be caused by parked vehicles and roadside stalls. There is currently no need to take action for oncoming vehicles, but stay alert to the traffic in the opposite lane.",
