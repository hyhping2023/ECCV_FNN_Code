Firstly, there is a white van in the far left lane, slightly ahead of our vehicle, and it is in motion. The autonomous vehicle must monitor the van's speed and trajectory to ensure safe driving decisions. Additionally, a large yellow construction vehicle is parked on the right side of the road with its arm extended upwards. This vehicle is not blocking the lane but signals ongoing construction activities, which means the autonomous vehicle should reduce speed and be more vigilant.\n\nA person is observed standing on the central divider, with their back to the autonomous vehicle, likely involved in operating or monitoring the construction vehicles. The presence of this pedestrian near the construction site indicates that the autonomous vehicle should be ready to stop or slow down if the person steps onto the road.\n\nAlong the right side of the road, multiple traffic cones are placed, leading up to the construction vehicles. These cones are directing traffic away from the far-right lane due to construction work, and the autonomous vehicle may need to merge left if necessary.\n\nLastly, bicycles are parked on the sidewalk to the left. While they do not pose an immediate threat, their presence suggests that the autonomous vehicle should be cautious of potential bicyclists entering the lane from the left.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image that affect the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior."
