The presence and potential movements of the forklift could obstruct the path or interfere with the regular flow of traffic, posing a risk to safe driving conditions. Additionally, traffic lights displaying a green signal are observed at a distance at an intersection. This green signal indicates that vehicles, including the ego car, are allowed to proceed through the intersection, provided the way ahead is clear. In terms of road modifications, there are temporary construction barriers on the left side of the road, which partially block the adjacent lane. These barriers suggest the presence of potential road work or obstacles, affecting the lanes available for traffic flow."

The presence of this type of vehicle suggests that there may be construction activity nearby. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for the potential of encountering construction-related obstructions or detours ahead. The driver should also be cautious and watch for construction workers and equipment that might enter the roadway unexpectedly.",

It should be ready to slow down or stop in case the forklift moves into the path of traffic. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car can continue driving through the intersection if it is safe to do so, while remaining vigilant for any instructions from road workers or unexpected shifts in traffic due to the presence of barriers."
