This vehicle is facing away from the ego car and is occupying the right lane as well as part of the left lane. Due to its size and position, it's limiting the available space for the ego car to navigate safely. This may require the ego car to change lanes or adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light with a left-turn arrow illuminated, indicating that the ego car has the right of way to proceed or turn left when it is safe to do so. However, the ego car must consider the position of the heavy construction vehicle ahead when deciding to proceed, especially if a turn is intended.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Due to its size and potential load weight, the presence of this vehicle on the road can lead to slower movements and potential lane width restrictions. The future driving behavior of the ego car may include maintaining a safe following distance, being prepared for sudden stops or slowdowns, and potentially maneuvering to change lanes if the construction vehicle occupies more space or is moving at a significantly reduced speed compared to regular traffic.",
