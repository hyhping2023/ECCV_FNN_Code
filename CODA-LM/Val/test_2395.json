It is partially illuminated, perhaps by a nearby street lamp. This bicycle does not directly influence the car's immediate driving behavior as it is parked off the roadway. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered in this scenario."

In situations where obstacles may be present, reduce your speed to ensure safe stopping distance. Where possible, safely keep to the side of the road that is clear of trash to minimize any potential risks. If necessary, make sure to use your headlights and high beams appropriately to maintain good visibility, as it appears to be nighttime.",

For the ego car, encountering garbage on or near the driving path could affect driving behavior by necessitating a deviation from the normal driving path to avoid physical contact with the debris. The driver may need to steer slightly to ensure safe passage and prevent any potential damage to the vehicle or spreading of the garbage.",

It is stationary and parked on the side of the road or within a designated parking area. The presence of a parked moped near the ego car's trajectory is crucial as it may indicate that there could be pedestrians nearby, or that the moped may potentially enter the roadway. Awareness of such objects is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance, to monitor for any signs of movement, and to be prepared to react if the moped becomes active or if there are interactions with pedestrians.",

It is a collection of various items discarded and left for collection. The presence of garbage on or near a roadway can present a driving hazard as it may attract animals, can potentially be blown onto the roadway, or may cause drivers to swerve to avoid it. In the future driving behavior of the ego car, the driver should maintain awareness of the potential for debris to enter the roadway and be prepared to react if necessary by slowing down or safely navigating around it.",
