The vehicles category includes a stationary blue city bus on the left, positioned at a bus stop parallel to the curb. The presence of the bus might restrict the maneuverability within the lane for the ego car, especially if the bus reenters traffic, which would necessitate the ego car to possibly slow down or change lanes. Additionally, there are several cars on the road ahead moving in the same direction as the ego car, following the lane markings. The ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for the potential decelerations or lane changes from these cars. There are also multiple vehicles observed in the oncoming lanes, such as a white car and a red car, moving away from the ego carâ€™s perspective. While they are not currently affecting the ego car's path, they must be watched cautiously in case any of them decides to make a turn.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, pedestrians are seen crossing the street directly in front of the ego car within a marked crosswalk. The ego car is legally required to yield to the pedestrians and must wait for them to safely cross before proceeding.\n\nConcerning traffic signs, there are directional signs over the road indicating the proper lanes and directions for traffic flow, which the ego car should adhere to for maintaining order and lawfulness on the road. Moreover, there are road markings on the pavement indicating a pedestrian crossing. These serve as a reminder for the ego car to respect and yield to any pedestrians who may be using the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic lights visible in the image are showing green and are positioned above the road at an upcoming intersection. The green light signals that the ego car may proceed but with continued vigilance for other road users, including the aforementioned crossing pedestrians.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in this particular image, indicating that these features are absent from the scene and therefore do not affect driving behavior in the present context."
