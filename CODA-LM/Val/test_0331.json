Additionally, there is an oncoming vehicle with its high beams on, creating potential glare and requiring the driver to stay in their own lane and remain vigilant.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian dressed in dark clothes standing beside a bicycle on the right side of the road with their back to the street. This individual, despite not being on the roadway, poses a risk of suddenly entering the driving path, necessitating cautious driving.\n\nAs for other objects, a bicycle and a trash can are parked on the right side of the sidewalk. These objects signal an area with frequent activity where pedestrians or cyclists may appear suddenly. Furthermore, trees by the roadside are adorned with lights, enhancing visibility but potentially causing distractions for drivers.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are identified in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed to ensure you have enough reaction time to navigate around parked cars on the right, while remaining vigilant for pedestrians near bicycles who may suddenly enter the roadway. Use low-beam headlights to prevent being dazzled by oncoming traffic, and stay in the correct lane to safely pass vehicles coming from the opposite direction. Continuously observe the surrounding environment to prevent any unexpected obstacles or road users from appearing. Drive cautiously at reduced speeds in the presence of pedestrians and when parking may block the lane or car doors might open suddenly. Keep a safe distance from the red car parked on the roadside, and be aware of oncoming traffic. Pay attention to changes in the road conditions that could be caused by lighting conditions and reflections.",
