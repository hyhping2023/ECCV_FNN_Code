Ahead of the ego car, a red car is stopped at a traffic light, indicating that the ego car should also prepare to stop. Additionally, vehicles are traveling in the opposite lane, which requires the ego car to maintain awareness for any potential hazards, such as a vehicle crossing the median.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the scene.\n\nA red traffic signal at the intersection ahead signals that the ego car must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding. This is reinforced by another traffic light displaying a red signal, which requires the ego car to come to a halt.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are set up to guide traffic from the right lane to the left, indicating that the right lane is closed. The ego car should follow this guidance and stay in the left lane.\n\nPermanent barriers, in conjunction with the traffic cones, separate the road from the sidewalk and planted areas, ensuring that the ego car stays on the road and away from pedestrian zones.\n\nLastly, there are potted plants situated beyond the traffic cones to the right. These plants are stationary and do not affect the roadway, but any movement near them should be monitored for the potential appearance of pedestrians or animals."
