This sign signifies that the road ahead is closed for entry, thus requiring the ego car to either stop or find an alternative route.\n\nAdditionally, red and white traffic cones are arranged in a line across the road, signaling that the area is closed off to vehicles. These cones form a physical barrier that the ego vehicle must not cross, necessitating a detour or alternative route.\n\nFurthermore, a visible barrier composed of red and white striped tape stretches across the road, indicating that the road is closed to vehicular traffic. This barrier mandates that the ego car must stop or divert its course due to the road closure.\n\nNo other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects are present in the image."

It is not necessary to stop, but caution should be used when navigating around the blocked-off area."
