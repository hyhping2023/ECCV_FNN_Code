This serves as a signal that congestion may be present ahead, and hence, it is essential for the driver to stay vigilant and be ready to halt at a moment's notice.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side, a cement mixer truck is visible. Its location in the lane directly in front, slightly obscuring the view, is noteworthy. The truck's large size and presence suggest that it could make unexpected turns or create obstructions, requiring the driver to stay cautious and anticipate any sudden movements from it.\n\nFurthermore, there is a hanging signboard with route information for different lanes. While this sign helps in planning for lane changes or exits that may be coming up, it does not require any immediate adjustments to driving behavior."
