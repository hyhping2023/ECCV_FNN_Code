We see a large yellow road maintenance vehicle positioned ahead in the right lane. This vehicle is uniquely equipped with a flashing arrow which is indicating that vehicles should merge to the left. The presence of this road maintenance vehicle affects the driving behavior of our car, as the signaling of the flashing arrow suggests there is a potential hazard that necessitates a lane change. This is a precaution for the safety of all involved, both for the road maintenance vehicle and the ego vehicle."

This vehicle may be stationary or moving slowly, often on or near construction sites. The presence of this construction vehicle on or near the roadway indicates that there might be road work ahead. The ego car should approach with caution, reduce speed, and be prepared to alter its route according to road signs, signals, and any directions given by traffic controllers or construction workers.",

It is also advisable to increase following distance to provide a buffer zone for any unexpected stops or slowdowns caused by the road maintenance operations. Maintain a safe following distance from the large yellow vehicle ahead to allow for sufficient reaction time. Be prepared to change lanes if the yellow vehicle is moving significantly slower than the speed limit, checking for other traffic before doing so. Continue to monitor the road conditions and traffic ahead for any changes that could affect driving behavior."
