        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under review, there are a few key elements that affect or potentially affect the driving environment. Firstly, there's a white car located on the left side of the road. It is partially visible and is positioned in the same direction as our vehicle. While this car is parked and doesn't pose a direct threat to driving safety, its presence suggests that the area may be busy or residential, indicating to drivers that caution should be exercised possibly due to the activities typically associated with such areas.\n\nOn the signage front, there's a blue parking sign on the right side of the road, marked with a white \"P\" to indicate the presence of a parking area ahead. For drivers seeking parking, this sign is an important marker; however, for those continuing their journey, it may not have an immediate impact on their driving behavior, aside from indicating the potential movement of vehicles entering or exiting parking spaces nearby.\n\nLastly, an area of concern is spotted with trash bags and other clutter piled up on the right side of the road, close to a building. This debris spills onto the street, presenting a potential hazard. There's a risk that more items might fall or be blown onto the road, which could create obstacles for vehicles. Drivers need to be aware of such possibilities and possibly adjust their speed or lane position to safely navigate around these obstructions.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers have been noted in the image, suggesting that these do not contribute to the current driving scenario in a significant way."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the tricycle ahead, watch out for obstacles possibly due to debris on the right, and be prepared to swerve if necessary. Since white vehicles might intrude into the driving lane, and pedestrians may appear near parked bicycles, your vehicle should slow down and be prepared to change lanes if necessary while continuously monitoring the road for any sudden movements or obstacles. Parking signs indicate available parking areas if needed. Continue to monitor the surroundings for potential road users or signs. Parked bicycles indicate the possible presence of pedestrians or cyclists nearby; thus, please drive carefully. Your vehicle should also maintain a moderate speed and stay towards the left side of the road to avoid potential movements of stationary vehicles.",

The presence of garbage on or near the road may require the ego car to maneuver carefully to avoid any potential obstructions to the driving path and to maintain a clean environment by not contributing to the littering. Additionally, the ego car's sensors need to be able to differentiate between stationary objects such as trash and dynamic ones like pedestrians or animals that might emerge from behind the garbage, requiring vigilance and potentially adaptive speed.",
