        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large black garbage truck on the right side of the road. It appears to be either stationary or moving very slowly in a direction parallel to the ego vehicle. Due to the truck's significant size and operational nature, designed for garbage collection, it may make frequent stops and execute slow maneuvers. These actions have the potential to disrupt the regular flow of traffic. As a precaution, other vehicles including the ego car may need to maintain an increased following distance from the truck to ensure safety and accommodate its unpredictable driving patterns. There are no other road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, reported in the scene."

The presence of this truck on the road indicates that the ego car needs to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for slower acceleration and longer stopping distances of such large vehicles. Additionally, the truck might limit visibility ahead, so overtaking maneuvers should be conducted with caution.",
