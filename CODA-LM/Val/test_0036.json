        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a white sedan directly ahead of the host vehicle. The movement of this sedan is critical as it will influence the driving decisions of the host vehicle, such as when to drive on or when to change lanes. Additionally, there is a tanker overtaking the self-driving vehicle on the left lane, which is marked for carrying hazardous materials. Due to the potential risks associated with its cargo, the autonomous vehicle must maintain a safe distance and exercise caution when overtaking or changing lanes. Also present is a blue bus on the left side, moving in the same direction as the host vehicle. The size of the bus and its potential stops could impact the traffic conditions and flow.\n\nThe overhead traffic sign provides directions for the lanes and indicates a left turn ahead. This information is essential for the self-driving vehicle to position itself correctly in advance if it intends to take the left turn.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are red and white traffic barriers delineating the road from a construction area. These barriers suggest the presence of construction workers or vehicles near the autonomous vehicle's path, recommending a reduction in speed and heightened alertness.\n\nLastly, a construction crane is visible in the background on the right, beyond the barriers, signaling ongoing construction work. While the crane does not directly influence the immediate driving decisions of the vehicle, it provides context for the presence of the barriers and the need for caution in the area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should remain stationary before the traffic light turns green, maintaining a safe distance from the tank truck ahead, being vigilant of any potential movements of the bus on the left, and watching for vehicles that may enter from the parking facilities indicated by the blue signs. Due to obstacles on the right, signal in advance before changing lanes, and execute with caution. Keep a safe distance from the white sedan in front, and be prepared to slow down due to potential red lights or traffic congestion from the merging lanes ahead. If you need to change lanes due to lane closure, check your rearview mirror and side mirrors to ensure safety, and continue monitoring the surrounding traffic, especially for vehicles that may merge from the right lane. Additionally, as you approach the construction site, be mindful of the site marked by obstacles and cranes, drive carefully, and be alert for any construction-related vehicles or personnel that may enter the road.",
