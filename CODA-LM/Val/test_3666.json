When driving behind such a vehicle, the driver of the ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance to ensure there is sufficient room to stop or maneuver in case the truck slows down or stops suddenly. The size of the truck may also limit the visibility of the road ahead, so the ego car's driver should be cautious and prepared for any unforeseen obstacles or changes in traffic flow.",

With the large vehicle blocking the path, the ego car cannot proceed as usual and will have to wait for the vehicle to move, or if possible and legal, carefully navigate around the vehicle, taking into consideration the road conditions and visibility. It is essential to ensure there are no oncoming vehicles or other road users that may be obstructed from view due to the darkness before attempting any maneuver."
