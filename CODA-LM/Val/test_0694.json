The truck's significant size and its position directly ahead mean it dictates the immediate driving behavior for the ego car, affecting following distance and the ability to overtake. Additionally, the operation of the mixer truck could lead to potential falling debris, which requires increased caution.\n\nBesides the truck, there are other objects in the environment that could potentially affect driving. There are overhead power lines running parallel to the road that do not directly influence driving behavior but are an important part of the general traffic environment. Awareness of such infrastructure is crucial in case of road works or unexpected obstacles that may be related to them. Furthermore, there are power lines above the road and unsecured tarp-like material on the right side, which can become hazards if dislodged. The presence of construction materials and the potential for loose debris necessitates additional vigilance to respond to unexpected obstacles."

Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed to increase vehicle control and stopping performance. Constantly assess the possibility of safely overtaking the truck if it is traveling below the speed limit and if road conditions allow. Be vigilant for any debris on the road, adjust speed for the road conditions and visibility, and be prepared to adjust the driving path if necessary while staying in the same lane due to the lack of oncoming traffic and absence of road users or signs indicating a need for lane changes. Monitor the surroundings for any changes in road conditions or traffic signs."
