As the brake lights are not noticeably lit, it could either be moving or stationary. This SUV is on the route of the self-driving car and has a set lane speed, making it necessary to maintain a safe following distance to allow for potential driving maneuvers.\n\nSecondly, a black sedan is situated on the adjacent lane to the right of the ego car, in front of it. This indicates that the sedan's speed is similar to or slightly faster than the ego vehicleâ€™s speed. The position and movement of this sedan are significant as it might change lanes or influence the traffic flow of the two lanes."

Due to the blurry images, our vehicle should use all available sensors to maintain clear situational awareness and be ready to respond to any unexpected changes in the driving environment at all times. Should the view ahead become uncertain or traffic conditions change, always be prepared to slow down.",
