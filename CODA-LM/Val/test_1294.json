The presence of the SUV directly affects the following distance and speed of autonomous vehicles, which needs to be carefully monitored to avoid rear-end collisions.\n\nAdditionally, a red vehicle is situated on the left side of our car, also traveling in the same direction. The proximity of this vehicle necessitates awareness of potential lateral movements, which may affect the ability to change lanes.\n\nAhead in the left lane, there is a bus traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. The bus's frequent stops may affect the flow of traffic, and drivers of private cars need to monitor the movements of buses to prevent sudden stops or turns.\n\nOn the right, a blue traffic sign displays a roadwork symbol, a symbol for changing lanes to the left, and a speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour. This sign alerts self-driving vehicles to be aware of road construction ahead, to consider changing lanes to the left, to reduce speed as recommended, and to increase vigilance.\n\nTemporary green barriers are placed on the open ground between road lanes, indicating that there may be road construction ahead or closed lanes. Drivers should be cautious and a lane change may be necessary.\n\nLastly, there are random fragments (chunks of concrete) scattered on the right side of the road. These fragments could pose a danger if they cause any vehicle to swerve suddenly to avoid them or block the road. It is necessary for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to respond at any time.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe following distance behind the white SUV, observing its speed and braking patterns and adjusting accordingly. Also, pay attention to the lateral distance of the red vehicle and the possibility of the bus stopping. Due to the speed limit sign indicating 30 km/h and the road construction sign, deceleration is necessary. It is recommended to continuously monitor the surrounding environment to respond to any changes in traffic or road conditions. Compliance with the lane adjacent to the concrete barriers is a must, ensuring a safe lateral distance. Caution is required due to traffic cones and obstacles, indicating possible road construction or lane merging.",
