        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a white delivery vehicle parked on the side of the road, partially obstructing the right lane. It has yellow and orange branding and appears larger than an average car, which suggests it might be challenging to navigate around. This parked vehicle could be an obstruction for the ego car and thus might necessitate either a lane change or a reduction in speed to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nFurthermore, there is a dark grey sedan traveling in the same direction as the ego car, located in the center lane of the multi-lane road. This sedan is part of the ongoing traffic and will influence the ego car's decision to either continue following at a steady pace or overtake, depending on the relative speeds and desired trajectory of the ego car.\n\nThere is no mention of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene, which implies that such elements do not need to be considered in the driving decisions in this particular situation."

The tricycle appears to be carrying a large load, which may affect its stability and maneuverability.
