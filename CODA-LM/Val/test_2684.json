The tricycle is moving at a slower speed than typical car traffic and may make sudden movements or stops, hence careful distance monitoring is required.",

It is close and sharing the same lane, which requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary."

This tricycle is moving slower than typical car traffic, which necessitates careful distance monitoring. The ego car may need to adjust speed or change lanes to avoid a collision, as the tricycle could make sudden movements or stops.\n\nA white arrow on a black square background sign is seen directly beneath a red advertisement sign, indicating that the lane continues straight ahead. This overhead sign is positioned on the right-hand side above the road and provides important lane guidance for the ego car, suggesting it should proceed in the current direction.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light showing a red signal is visible ahead in the distance, positioned above the center of the road, with a green light currently illuminated for the ego car's lane. This indicates that the ego vehicle should continue moving if it is safe to do so while adhering to traffic regulations."

While driving near this type of vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe passing distance and be prepared for the possibility that the cyclist may make unexpected maneuvers or stops.

Continue in the current lane following the direction of the arrow sign and monitor the wet road conditions, adjusting speed accordingly to allow for increased stopping distance. Remain alert for potential road users not currently visible and prepare for possible lane changes if overtaking the tricycle is deemed necessary and can be done safely. The ego car should reduce speed if necessary to maintain a safe following distance behind the three-wheeled vehicle and prepare to come to a full stop at the red traffic light ahead. The driver should not attempt to overtake or change lanes unless the lane beside is clear and it's necessary to follow their intended route. Furthermore, they should continuously monitor the traffic light to proceed when it turns green."
