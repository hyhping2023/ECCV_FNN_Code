It is advised to be vigilant, ready to respond to the dog crossing the driving path or other unpredictable actions. If it is safe to do so, the vehicle could also slightly turn left to maintain a greater distance from the dog on the left side as a precaution. Considering the slippery road conditions, vehicles should increase their following distance to compensate for the reduced traction. Maintain the current lane and a safe driving speed; if a dog enters the driving lane, be ready to slow down or stop. Stay alert to any changes in road conditions or the appearance of traffic signs or signals.",
