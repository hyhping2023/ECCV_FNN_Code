The presence of a large, slow-moving vehicle ahead can affect the ego vehicle's speed and may require the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance or consider overtaking when safe."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large, open-topped truck loaded with debris visible on the right side of a two-lane road. It is traveling in the same direction as the ego car and is occupying the right part of its lane, with some of the debris extending slightly into the ego car's lane. This situation could impact the ego car's travel, as the truck's load and positioning may hinder the ability of the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, presenting a potential risk from falling debris. Additionally, due to the truck's size and potentially slower speed, the ego vehicle may need to adjust its velocity and consider overtaking when it is safe to do so. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large, specialized vehicle typically used for construction purposes. It is characterized by its heavy-duty structure and may be carrying construction materials or equipment. The vehicle appears to be stationary or moving very slowly, possibly due to ongoing work in the area or preparing to turn. The presence of this construction vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution, a potential reduction in speed, and preparedness for unexpected stops or detours. The driver should be alert for construction workers, signage indicating construction zones, and may need to change lanes if the construction vehicle is obstructing the path.",

Be alert for any potential roadwork ahead that the construction vehicle may be indicating. Overtaking the truck is not currently advisable due to the curve of the road and limited visibility ahead. Continuous monitoring of the truck's signals and brake lights is also recommended to anticipate its movements. Be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary while ensuring the opposite lane is clear. Monitor the truck's movements for any sudden changes in speed or direction that may indicate potential obstacles in the road ahead. Prepare to overtake if the truck slows down and it is safe and legal to do so on the left side, considering the clear road conditions. Regularly check rear-view and side mirrors for other vehicles that may be approaching to overtake."
