The first sign is a warning of an upcoming pedestrian crosswalk, and the second, placed just below it, prohibits honking. Drivers need to exercise increased caution when approaching the area indicated by these signs, staying alert for potential pedestrians or vehicles that could cross their path, and also be prepared for any changes in traffic flow that might require them to slow down. Additionally, there are reflective cones or posts to the right of the vehicle ahead, suggesting possible road constructions or a reduction in lane availability. For safety, drivers should be aware that their ability to move laterally could be constrained and that they may need to navigate around unforeseen hazards or traffic pattern alterations."
