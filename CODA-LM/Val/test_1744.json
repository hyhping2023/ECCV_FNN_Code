Prominently, there is a traffic sign with red and white diagonal stripes on a rectangular board mounted on the fence to the right side of the road, signaling that the area behind the fence is off-limits for vehicles and should not be mistaken as an accessible route by the ego car.\n\nAdding to this are traffic lights currently showing the red signal for both directions, which obligates the ego car to halt completely at the intersection for compliance with traffic laws and to maintain safety on the road.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is placed on the sidewalk, right side, hinting at a potential hazard or cautioning against entering a specific area. This signifies that the ego car must be aware of probable roadworks or pedestrian activities that may encroach onto the driving path.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier with red and white stripes is found in the foreground of the right side, acting as an obstruction to a particular zone. This barrier signifies a blocked area not meant for vehicles, including the ego car, and signals that a change in course or an alternate pathway must be sought out.\n\nFurther observations do not reveal any other significant objects in the scene."

If the stone is large enough to pose a potential hazard to vehicles, it may require the driver to steer around it to avoid tire damage or loss of control. Even small stones can be a risk if they are thrown up by the tires, potentially causing damage to other cars or pedestrians.
