An individual in a white dress is on the sidewalk to the left, whose close proximity to the crossing area suggests exercising caution in case they decide to cross.\n\nTraffic signage includes a speed limit sign on the right-hand side of the road indicating a limit of 30 km/h, mandating adherence to this speed limit. The traffic light above the intersection is displaying green for the direction the ego vehicle is facing, which indicates the right of way to proceed, provided there is no emergency vehicle or crossing pedestrian.\n\nOther objects on the sidewalk to the right, including a dustbin and an electrical box, are also present, though they do not directly influence driving behavior but should be noted as peripheral elements."
