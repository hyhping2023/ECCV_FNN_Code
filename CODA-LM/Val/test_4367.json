        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles present. The first is a large, yellow construction-related vehicle loaded with heavy machinery, which occupies the full lane ahead of the ego car. This vehicle could obstruct the view ahead and may move unpredictably or suddenly stop, requiring quick reactions from the ego vehicle. The second vehicle is a black sedan, which is in the lane adjacent to the right of the ego car and positioned slightly ahead. The sedan's presence means the ego car might have to consider a lane change or merging action, particularly if it needs to navigate around the truck ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic signal visible to the right of the construction vehicle, indicating that traffic in the direction of the ego car should stop. This signal directly influences the ego car to remain stationary until the light turns green.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in the scene. The ego car's driving behavior will be mainly influenced by the large vehicle ahead and the traffic light's instructions."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle is being transported on a trailer. The construction vehicle appears to be a large, heavy-duty piece of equipment, commonly used in roadworks or building construction. Considering its size and the fact that it is being carried by a trailer, the ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance to allow for sufficient stopping time in case the trailer slows down unexpectedly or stops. Moreover, the size of the construction vehicle might obstruct the view ahead, requiring the driver of the ego car to exercise even greater caution and to be prepared for any roadway changes or obstacles that could be hidden from sight.",

The vehicle should also keep monitoring the black sedan for any sudden lane changes or movements, especially as traffic begins to move. Once the traffic light turns green, the car should proceed with caution and be mindful of the large vehicle's slower acceleration pattern and possible stops for construction activities."
