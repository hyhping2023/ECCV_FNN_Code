        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene includes parked vehicles on the side of the road which are poorly illuminated and some lack visible tail lights or reflectors. The varying shapes and sizes of these vehicles suggest that they could be a mix of cars or small trucks. These vehicles pose potential hazards as their placement on the road could reduce the drivable space, and their limited visibility increases the risk of a collision. It is essential for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance to avoid any accidents. Additionally, the absence of clear road demarcations or barriers coupled with a lack of ambient lighting means that there is a high demand for attentive driving. The ego vehicle must be ready to stop or navigate around unexpected obstacles and is advised to proceed with caution at a reduced speed."

The position of the car indicates it is parked. The ego car must maintain an appropriate distance from the parked car to avoid any potential collision and to ensure a safe passage through the area. If the road width does not allow for sufficient clearance between the ego car and the parked car, the ego car may need to reduce speed or stop to yield to oncoming traffic or to safely navigate around the parked car.",

Its position is a relevant factor in foreseeing the ego car's potential driving behavior. The driver of the ego car should be aware of this parked car to avoid any potential collisions and to ensure a safe distance is maintained while passing by. Additionally, the ego car driver should be cautious of any movement from the parked vehicle, like doors opening or the car pulling out into the road, and be prepared to react accordingly.",

It should use appropriate headlights and possibly fog lights, if equipped and conditions require, to improve visibility while being mindful of oncoming traffic to avoid glare. Scanning for non-illuminated obstacles and being prepared to stop or maneuver safely is essential. Without external lighting sources and clear road markings, reliance on vehicle sensory systems should be heightened."
