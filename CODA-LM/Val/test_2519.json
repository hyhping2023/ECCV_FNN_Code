        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are a few notable elements affecting navigation and driving behavior for the autonomous vehicle (ego car).\n\nFirstly, there is a red forklift positioned on the right side of the road. It is partially on the road and partially on the curbside, facing toward the direction of the ego car. The presence of the forklift could obstruct the lane partially, limiting the navigable space available for the ego car. This situation demands attention and may require the ego car to perform potential maneuvering to safely navigate past the forklift without incident.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light situated directly in front of the ego car is displaying a red signal. This mandates that the ego car must come to a stop and wait for the traffic light to change to green before it can proceed further. This is a critical directive for ensuring compliance with traffic laws and maintaining road safety.\n\nMoreover, barriers are located to the right of the ego car. These barriers are distinguishable by their green and blue tarpaulins and serve the purpose of creating a partition between an ongoing construction area and the road. The presence of these barriers is indicative of a construction zone, which could potentially affect lane availability and necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe distance to avoid any hazards associated with the construction activities.\n\nThese elements collectively inform the driving behavior required of the ego car in this scenario, emphasizing the need for cautious navigation and adherence to traffic regulations to ensure safety.\n"

            "description and explanation": "This image features a construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, located to the left side of the road. It appears to be stationary or moving slowly, often associated with construction or maintenance activities. The presence of this vehicle indicates that there may be ongoing work in the vicinity, which could lead to potential obstacles or changes in the usual traffic pattern. Consequently, the driver of the ego vehicle should remain attentive, reduce speed, and be prepared to obey any temporary traffic signals or instructions from road workers. The driver should also watch for any construction workers or additional construction machinery that may unexpectedly enter the roadway.",

The driver should wait for the forklift operator's indication if the forklift is intended to move or continue operating in place."
