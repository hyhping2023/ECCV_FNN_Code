The presence of extended equipment suggests it may be moving slowly or stopping frequently, affecting traffic flow and requiring caution."

This vehicle is taking up most of its own lane and is also encroaching on the oncoming traffic lane. Due to its size and the extended equipment it is carrying, it could pose a hazard, especially if the ego vehicle tries to overtake it without enough room to do so safely. The construction vehicle may also move slowly or stop frequently, which could affect the flow of traffic and would require other drivers to exercise caution when approaching or passing it. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."

It appears to be occupying a part of the roadway ahead, which implies that the ego car would need to exercise caution, reduce speed, and possibly change lanes to maintain a safe distance while passing the construction site, if roadway conditions and traffic regulations permit.",

Prepare to slow down or stop if the vehicle ahead does so. Overtake only if there is clear visibility ahead and sufficient space to return to the lane, complying with road markings and rules. Considering the rural setting, be alert for potential unexpected road users and obstacles that may appear suddenly, such as wildlife or vehicles entering from side roads."
