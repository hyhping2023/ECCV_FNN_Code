Currently, there are no other road users such as pedestrians or cyclists, so attention should be focused on observing the static environment. Given the construction happening on the right side, drivers should be prepared to keep to the left and be alert for any possible workers or unexpected obstacles. Even after the red light turns green, considering the circumstances, speed should be reduced and vigilance increased to safely pass through the construction area.",
