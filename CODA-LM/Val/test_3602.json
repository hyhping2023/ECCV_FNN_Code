However, there is an object of interest captured in the image. Specifically, there is a large green object on the right side of the road. It appears to be a trash bin or a large container. The presence of this object is significant as it could potentially affect driving behavior. If the object were to extend into the roadway or if a pedestrian were to unexpectedly emerge from behind it, it could constitute a hazard to oncoming traffic, thus necessitating caution by the self-driving car."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the dimness of the road, which makes it difficult to discern potential hazards, please maintain a lower driving speed. Use the appropriate headlight setting to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic, and be prepared to respond to sudden obstacles at all times. Exercise caution at intersections and be aware of pedestrians that may appear around green objects by the roadside.",

This object is often used for accumulating garbage and is typically emptied by waste collection services. In a driving scenario, this waste bin being placed near the edge of the road may affect the ego car's navigation by potentially narrowing the drivable space on the road. The driver may need to steer slightly away from the container to maintain a safe distance and ensure there is no risk of collision.",
