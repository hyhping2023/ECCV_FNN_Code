It is a small white truck or delivery van with hazard lights flashing, which suggests that it may be stopped due to an emergency or for loading/unloading purposes. Because the vehicle occupies part of the lane, it may require the ego car to maneuver around it.\n\nAdditionally, there are two orange traffic cones in the middle of the ego car's lane, directly behind the stationary vehicle. These traffic cones are set up to guide traffic away from the stationary vehicle or a potential road hazard ahead. As a result, the ego car must adjust its path to change lanes or navigate around the obstruction, taking care to avoid entering the path of any oncoming traffic.\n\nThere are no visible vulnerable road users like pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity, nor are there any traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
