These cones serve as a warning to drivers that a portion of the road may be unfit for travel, possibly due to nearby potential hazards or construction activities. Consequently, drivers are advised to remain within the marked lanes and keep a safe distance from the cones to avoid any danger.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concern regarding glare on the windshield, which could be caused by reflections from either interior or exterior lights. This glare has the potential to impair the driver's visibility, and it is recommended to address this issue by ensuring the windshield is clean and by adjusting the interior lighting to minimize the reflections and maintain clear visibility while driving."

Take measures to reduce windshield glare, thereby enhancing night visibility. Keep your current lane position and drive according to the temporary lane markings set up by traffic cones, avoiding restricted areas on the right. Watch for possible roadworks or related obstacles ahead, follow the lanes indicated by traffic cones, and be prepared to handle potential slippery road conditions.",
