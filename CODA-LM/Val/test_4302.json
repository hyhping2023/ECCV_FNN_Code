        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a white car parked on the left side, partially on the sidewalk, with its front facing our vehicle. This poses a potential risk as the car may decide to enter the road, necessitating caution and readiness to stop. Additionally, a dark-colored car is parked on the same side, closer to our vehicle, and is partially blocking the lane. This reduces the available driving space, and our vehicle may need to adjust its path slightly to the left to safely pass by.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the far right, moving away from our vehicle and parallel to the road. While the pedestrian is not directly affecting the driving behavior at the moment, autonomous vehicles should keep an eye on their movements to anticipate any sudden crossing of the road.\n\nThe road ahead is obstructed by yellow barriers, indicating that a detour is necessary to continue. The vehicle will need to modify its driving route to navigate around these obstacles safely.\n\nLastly, there are construction materials or rubble piled up on the right side of the road, near the parked dark-colored car. This could potentially lead to debris on the road, and it is recommended to drive with caution to prevent any damage to the vehicle.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the vehicles parked along the side of the road and possible pedestrian activity, this vehicle should proceed with caution. If the white car shows any sign of movement, be prepared to slow down or stop. When passing parked vehicles, especially dark-colored ones, this vehicle should move slightly to the left to ensure safe passage, while also being mindful of oncoming traffic. Additionally, cautiously navigate around debris and traffic cones on the right, maintaining lane integrity and avoiding obstacles. Given the current situation and road users, ensure a safe distance is kept from parked vehicles and be ready to maneuver around traffic cones and obstacles. It is advised to monitor pedestrians' movements to respond to any potential changes. Special attention should be paid to the risk of slipping due to wet and slippery road surfaces.",
