A white cement mixer truck is positioned ahead on the road, occupying the active lane with its right turn signal active. This indicates that it is about to make a right turn, potentially requiring the ego vehicle to slow down or stop to allow the truck to turn.\n2. A police car is parked on the left side of the intersection, slightly behind a row of yellow poles. It represents an authority presence, necessitating extra caution and strict adherence to traffic laws by the drivers.\n3. A white car on the left nearby lane is facing towards the same direction as the ego vehicle and appears to be in motion. This car's position and movement require monitoring in case it changes lanes or adjusts its speed.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A cyclist is moving alongside the cement mixer truck, slightly ahead, positioned between the mixer and a row of yellow barriers. The cyclist's proximity to the turning truck necessitates careful consideration to ensure safety.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. No visible traffic signs affecting immediate driving decisions are observed in this image. This lack does not lead to direct adjustments in driving behavior.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n1. Red traffic lights are visible on the traffic signal directly above the cement mixer truck's cab. This indicates that all vehicles and bicycles at the intersection should stop, including the ego vehicle, which should wait for the green light before proceeding.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. Yellow and black traffic cones are placed in front of the pedestrian crosswalk and to the side of the ego vehicle's lane. They may indicate a lane closure or separation from part of the roadway, guiding the traffic flow, and suggesting reduced lane width.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Yellow and black bollards are lining the edge of the pedestrian crossing area, separating it from the cycle lane. These bollards define the boundaries for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, guiding the ego car's driving path.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n1. A billboard is standing by the roadside to the right, along with other urban fixtures like lamp posts. These do not directly affect driving behavior but are part of the peripheral environment.\n2. A dustbin is placed near the crosswalk on the right-hand side. While it does not obstruct the road, it should be acknowledged in case pedestrians approach it, potentially entering the roadway.\n3. Construction scaffolding is on the building to the right. Although it does not directly affect the road, it indicates potential construction activity in the area, necessitating awareness of possible road condition changes and the presence of construction vehicles."

Once the traffic light turns green, proceed with caution, especially if the mixer truck is executing its turn, to ensure the truck completes its maneuver safely and the cyclist is not at risk. The presence of the police vehicle reinforces the importance of following traffic laws precisely in this scenario. Monitor the white car's movement for any indication of lane changes or speed adjustments. Keep a safe distance from the cyclist on the right and be alert for any potential pedestrians that might approach the crosswalk from the right. Once the traffic light turns green, proceed with caution, especially if the traffic cones indicate reduced lane width or detours ahead."
