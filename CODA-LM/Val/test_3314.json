Additionally, the ego car should monitor the parked vehicle for signs of movement and be prepared to navigate around it if necessary, while also being ready to give way to the pedestrian. Proceed with caution due to the presence of a pedestrian near another vehicle. The pedestrian's behavior suggests potential interaction with the vehicle, which may cause unpredictability in their movement. Maintain a lower speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver if the pedestrian steps onto the road. The road conditions seem normal and there are no additional hazards from traffic signs, lights, cones, or barriers. Keep an eye on the stationary objects to the right as a precaution."
