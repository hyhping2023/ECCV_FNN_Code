Additionally, a large truck occupies the lane to the right, a significant consideration given its size, the risk of a side scrape, and its blind spots which could affect lateral maneuvers.\n\nThere are also workers near the left edge of the driving lane, clearly visible in their high-visibility jackets. Their proximity to the roadway necessitates increased attentiveness as they pose a potential risk of entering the road.\n\nOrange traffic cones are situated on the left edge of the roadway, designating a separation between the traffic lanes and a construction zone, guiding the vehicle's path and limiting the available driving space on that side.\n\nMoreover, a green barrier encloses a construction or work zone on the left side of the road. Though not intruding into the traffic lanes, its presence necessitates a lower speed and heightened awareness due to the closeness of the construction activity to the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the scene that impact driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the mixed traffic involving heavy vehicles, construction elements, and pedestrians, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed, ready to come to an abrupt stop or swiftly decelerate at any moment. The driver should pay close attention to concrete mixer trucks that may enter the lane, and be prepared to yield at all times. Observing the behavior of the white van is crucial for maintaining a safe following distance. Furthermore, the vehicle should stay vigilant for any workers or pedestrians who might step onto the road, and when the road ahead is clear and safe, the vehicle should appropriately adjust its lateral position to the right to steer clear of construction areas and traffic cones on the left. Be aware of potential lane changes or stops by large trucks on the right, which could affect the lateral or longitudinal space around the vehicle. Continue to scan the surroundings, noting any additional road signs or signals that become visible as the vehicle approaches, and adjust driving behavior in accordance with the current road conditions, adhering to all traffic sign instructions.",
