This affects the ego car's ability to continue moving at its current speed and requires maintaining a safe following distance to avoid collisions.\n- Two trucks are visible on the right side; one is white with a blue tarp-covered load, and the other is green and farther ahead. A green truck is parked farther ahead on the right side, partially obstructing the curb lane. These trucks affect the lane width and require caution when driving past. The parked truck could potentially affect the traffic flow, necessitating a potential merge to the left.\n- A white van is parked on the right near a red canopy, which may influence the ego car’s lane choice if it pulls out into traffic. It should be monitored for any movement indications.\n- Several vehicles are visible in the opposite lane, moving perpendicular to the ego car's trajectory, requiring monitoring in case any vehicle turns and crosses the ego car’s path.\n\n**Vulnerable road users** include:\n- Pedestrians are visible on the right side of the road, interacting with roadside stalls and potentially indicating road crossing activities. Their proximity to the traffic lane poses a risk for sudden crossing, requiring the ego car to be vigilant and prepared to stop.\n\n**Barriers** are present:\n- Metal barriers on the right delineate the space between the roadway and the stalls, clearly separating the market area from the road. However, the presence of nearby pedestrians necessitates close attention.\n\n**Other objects** include:\n- Market stalls and goods displayed on the left, close to the road, with some extending near the vehicle's lane. Red and white roadside stalls on the right and a red canopy indicate a market-like setting with pedestrian activity. These objects can cause obstructions or distractions, necessitating cautious driving, and the presence of pedestrians could lead to unpredictable movements near or onto the roadway.\n\nOverall, the image depicts various dynamic and static elements requiring the ego car to exercise caution and maintain awareness of the surrounding environment."

Caution should be exercised due to the market activity and potential pedestrian movement near the roadway. Constant observation of the vehicles from the opposite lane is necessary to anticipate any that may turn. The driver must also be aware of potential sun glare and adjust sun visors as needed. The speed should be reduced to ensure that the ego car can react safely to any unforeseen events or movements from the road users and objects around it. Be particularly attentive to pedestrians on the right who may enter the road and be prepared to stop. Navigate carefully past the parked trucks, ensuring not to veer too close to the market activity. Continue to observe the road ahead for any additional road users or signs that become visible. Maintain a safe distance behind the white SUV, be observant of the green truck and white van parked to the right in case they start moving, and exercise caution to deal with potential pedestrian movements near the red canopy. Be prepared to merge left if the traffic situation requires it due to the parked vehicles or roadside activity."
