        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there's a significant presence of a vehicle, specifically a red forklift. This forklift is located on the right side of the road, directly facing the viewpoint of the ego vehicle. It is notable for being partially positioned on the road with its forks pointing downwards, suggesting movement, an assertion supported by its activated lights. The placement and behavior of the forklift create a potential risk for the ego vehicle. The primary concerns arise from the forklift's unexpected positioning on the roadway, its relatively slow speed compared to typical road traffic, and the potential for it to execute unpredictable maneuvers. Furthermore, the forklift's presence might signal ongoing loading or unloading activities in the vicinity, prompting the ego vehicle to be vigilant and ready to decrease speed or come to a complete stop should the situation necessitate such actions. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects of note in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, is located on the side of the road. This industrial machine typically features a front-mounted lifting mechanism used for lifting and moving materials. Its positioning on the side indicates that it may be involved in road work or nearby construction activities. The presence of this vehicle should prompt the ego car to remain vigilant and possibly reduce speed, being prepared for potential workers in proximity, unexpected vehicle movement, or the presence of other construction-related obstructions that might affect the normal flow of traffic.",

Prepare to stop or maneuver cautiously if the forklift enters the main driving path. Watch for any signs of activity around the forklift, such as loading or unloading. Monitor the road conditions continuously and avoid harsh braking or steering to prevent skidding on the wet and potentially slippery surface. Remain vigilant for any changes in the forklift's activity and be prepared to stop or maneuver safely. Additionally, due to the road conditions, exercise caution to prevent skidding and maintain control of the vehicle."
