        "description and explanation": "The current traffic image presents a noteworthy aspect: the presence of traffic cones. Specifically, we observe orange traffic cones neatly arranged in a row on the road ahead. These cones seem to delineate an area which autonomous vehicles, along with other road users, are advised against entering. The reason behind this setup is fairly straightforwardâ€”the cones are there to signal the onset of construction activities ahead or a lane closure. This arrangement naturally plays a critical role in guiding vehicles to maintain their path within the open lanes, thus ensuring smooth and safe navigation through the affected section of the road. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or any other objects noted in this scene, making the traffic cones the primary focus for anyone navigating this stretch of road."
    },
    "driving_suggestion": "Approach the intersection carefully, ready to stop or maneuver around traffic cones. If the road is indeed slippery, adjust your speed to accommodate potential skidding conditions. If the traffic cones indicate a deviation from the usual path, follow the new route while remaining vigilant for any workers, debris, or equipment on the road. The presence of traffic cones suggests there may be closed lanes or ongoing construction ahead, so once the green light is on and it is clear which lane is obstructed by the cones, be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary.",

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used to signal areas where vehicular traffic is prohibited or redirected. It is commonly seen at construction sites, during road works, or when a part of the road is designated as off-limits for safety or organizational reasons. The presence of this cone in a traffic scenario suggests that the ego car should navigate around it without crossing the area it marks, which could indicate a closed lane or a segment of the road that should be avoided.",
