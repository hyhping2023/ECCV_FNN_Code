These cones are likely marking road construction areas or lane closures, guiding the vehicle to stay in its lane and alerting to potential obstacles or workers on the road. \n\nAlong the right side of the road, obstacles are placed, indicating construction or potential danger areas along the curb, signaling the need to merge left. These obstacles indicate the need to change lanes because the area is designated as a road construction zone or is unsuitable for driving. \n\nOn the far right lane, debris is scattered, including small objects that appear to be rocks or building materials. This debris on the road can pose a threat to vehicle safety, potentially causing tire damage or requiring emergency evasive action. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to road construction and the potential merging behavior of trucks, this vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to deal with potential hazards. It is recommended to monitor the behavior of trucks to observe any indications of them entering the traffic flow. This vehicle must remain vigilant to avoid debris and stay within the lane; if it is safe to do so, adjust the position slightly to the left to maximize the distance from the trucks and possible road workers. It is advised to continuously watch for any road workers or additional signs to accordingly adjust speed and lane position.",
