A black car is located slightly to the right in front of our vehicle, moving in the same direction. We need to pay attention to this vehicle as it occupies the lane ahead of us and could affect our driving decisions regarding speed and lane changes.\n\nAcross the intersection, there are several vehicles prepared to cross or already crossing, dependent on their respective traffic light signals. It's crucial for us to observe these vehicles since they have the right of way, so as to avoid any potential conflicts as they traverse the path our vehicle might take.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist ahead to the front right, riding a motorcycle with a blue rear cargo carrier and traveling in the same direction as we are. We must keep a close watch on this vulnerable road user since they are very close, could change directions unexpectedly, or might need to stop urgently.\n\nTo the left of our vehicle, a blue roadside information sign is visible. While this sign does not directly impact our driving behavior, it contributes to overall situational awareness and, therefore, should not be overlooked.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic scenario includes a green light ahead for our direction of travel. With a green light, we are given the clearance to proceed but must ensure the road is clear and safe, considering the positions and movements of other road users before advancing.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the scene that would influence our driving behavior or the need for immediate action."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the black car ahead. Pay attention to the trajectory of the motorcyclist, and be prepared to yield or stop if necessary. As the traffic light is green, continue to observe any vehicles changing lanes or turning. As long as overtaking the black car or adjusting for the bicyclist's movement isn't necessary, it seems there is no immediate need to change lanes. With respect to the right-of-way and considering the green traffic light, our vehicle should proceed through the intersection.
