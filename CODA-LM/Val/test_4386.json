        "description and explanation": "In the visual data observed, the image presents a road scenario with a significant presence of a large truck directly in front of the ego vehicle. The truck is noted for its considerable size, potentially heavy load, and the red and white reflective warning tape identifiable on its rear end. These characteristics suggest limited visibility around the truck for the ego vehicle. The significance of the truck's positioning relative to the ego car is profound. It directly influences the driving behavior, necessitating increased following distance, potentially limiting maneuvering options, and requiring more stopping time for safety.\n\nAdditionally, concerning traffic lights, the data indicates a lack of visibility within the image provided. The absence of visual confirmation on the status of traffic lights requires the ego vehicle to rely on following the lead of the truck ahead by default. This scenario underlines the importance of situational awareness and adaptability in autonomous driving, especially in conditions where not all typical traffic control elements are perceivable."

Until more of the road ahead becomes visible and it can be determined whether the large vehicle is stopped or merely moving slowly, the ego car should proceed with caution. Do not attempt overtaking unless the left lane is clear and it's safe and legal to do so."
