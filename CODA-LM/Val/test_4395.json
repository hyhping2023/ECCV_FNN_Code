    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, monitoring for any sudden changes in speed or direction. Additionally, due to the proximity of workers, be prepared to stop or slow down if any worker approaches the vehicle's path. Follow temporary traffic management measures, such as traffic cones, and reduce speed when necessary due to irregular road surfaces and possible debris at the construction site. The overall recommendation is to drive cautiously, respect green traffic lights, and remain vigilant for all road users and conditions that may affect safety. Monitor cyclists' movements to ensure safety and comply with green traffic lights while being prepared for the appearance of workers or changes in road conditions due to construction. Use available lanes to bypass the construction area and do not enter the areas marked by cones. Given the current traffic conditions, the vehicle should slow down due to the construction zone, slightly move left while staying within the lane to keep a safe distance from the work area, and be prepared for any unexpected actions by construction workers or cyclists. It is also important to obey any additional signs or signals that may appear near the construction site.",
