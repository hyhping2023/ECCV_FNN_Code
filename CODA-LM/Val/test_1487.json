It is oriented parallel to the direction of the ego car's lane. Its position partially obstructs the right lane, which leaves less space for the ego car to pass safely, especially if there may be oncoming traffic. The carâ€™s headlights are off, indicating it is stationary, but caution is required as the driver might unexpectedly return, open the door, or start to pull out into traffic.\n\nSecond, there is an oncoming vehicle with headlights on, traveling in the opposite direction on the other side of the road. The presence of this oncoming traffic necessitates for the ego car to remain in its lane and maintain a safe speed, ensuring it does not swerve into the opposite lane to avoid a potential head-on collision.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Headlights should be properly adjusted to ensure maximum visibility without blinding other drivers. Maintaining a safe speed and readiness to react to unexpected hazards are crucial."
