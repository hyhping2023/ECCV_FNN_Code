Firstly, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog is seen crossing the road directly in front of the ego car, illuminated by headlights against a night background. This scenario presents a significant safety risk that demands immediate attention from the driver. Additionally, multiple red traffic lights are visible at an intersection ahead, indicating that the ego car must come to a complete stop to adhere to traffic regulations. Furthermore, there is moderate illumination from street lights and vehicle headlights within a nighttime setting. These low-light conditions suggest that more cautious driving behavior is necessary due to potentially reduced visibility."
