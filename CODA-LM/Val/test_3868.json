The mixer truck is marked with the number '529' and has a license plate ending in '6978'. Since these types of trucks usually move slower and can stop abruptly, the ego car should keep a greater following distance and stay vigilant, as the truck may obscure the road ahead. \n\nBeside the ego car, within the adjacent lane, there are multiple vehicles including a white sedan ahead of the ego vehicle to the left. It's essential for the ego vehicle to keep track of these vehicles, particularly the white sedan, for any potential lane changes by them or the ego car itself.\n\nBehind the mixer truck, in the rightmost lane, there's a sedan that the ego car should keep in mind when considering lane changes or adjusting speed.\n\nAbove the mixer truck, a green traffic light is visible, giving the ego car's lane the right-of-way. The ego car should continue but be ready for the possibility of the traffic light changing and the actions of the heavy vehicle ahead."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. It is characterized by a rotating drum used to mix concrete components. Concrete mixer trucks are typically heavy and move slower than passenger vehicles. Considering its size and purpose, the vehicle may make sudden stops or slow down frequently to maneuver into construction sites or while preparing to unload concrete. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for potential stops or slow speed, and be cautious when overtaking, ensuring there is enough space and time to do so safely.",

Monitor the vehicles in adjacent lanes, be aware of their movements, especially the white sedan, and be prepared to adjust speed or position safely. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car can continue, but should be ready to react to the traffic situation accordingly, such as slowing down or stopping if the mixer truck ahead does so. Do not attempt to overtake vehicles from the right lane unless there is ample space and it is safe to do so. Stay vigilant for any unexpected road users or situations that may require evasive action."
