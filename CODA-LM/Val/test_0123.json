The vehicle must yield to the pedestrian as they have the right of way and directly influence the car's ability to proceed.\n\nYellow barriers are temporarily placed ahead, possibly indicating ongoing construction or roadwork. Drivers should proceed with caution as these barriers suggest modifications in the road layout.\n\nAdditionally, there are trees and shadows on the road that can affect visibility but will not impede traffic flow. Cautious driving is advised as other road users or pedestrians might be hidden in the shadows."
