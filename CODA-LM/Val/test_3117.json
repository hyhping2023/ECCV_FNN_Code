It has bright lights on and is transporting some type of cargo, which is potentially heavy or bulky, as suggested by the container and structure. The vehicle's brake lights are visible, indicating that it might be slowing down or coming to a stop.",
                "explanation": "The truck's presence and brake lights are critical for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential changes in speed or direction of the truck. It also limits the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car, necessitating increased caution."

        "description and explanation": "On the road ahead, there is a large truck directly ahead of the ego car, within the same lane and proceeding in the same direction. The truck stands out with its bright lights on and appears to be carrying a substantial load, given the visible container and its structure. It's noteworthy that the truck's brake lights are illuminated, signaling that the truck might be reducing its speed or preparing to stop.\n\nIt is crucial for the ego car to consider the truck's actions by maintaining an adequate following distance for safety reasons. The visible brake lights serve as a warning to be ready for any sudden changes in the truck's speed or course of travel. Moreover, the truck's substantial size and position obscure the ego car's view of the road that lies further ahead, which requires the ego car to proceed with heightened vigilance to ensure safety."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large, heavy vehicle known as a truck, specifically appearing to be a cargo transport vehicle with a container attachment. The vehicle's bright lights are on, likely indicating that it is actively operating on the road. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, this truck represents a dynamic object that requires careful distance maintenance. Overtaking such a vehicle should be done with caution, ensuring clear visibility and ample space to maneuver back into the lane. Furthermore, the driver should be alert for any sudden stops or turns that the truck may execute.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the limited visibility at night and the presence of a large truck in the same lane, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, adjust speed to the truck's actions, and be prepared to stop or slow down. The ego car should also remain alert for any sudden movements from the truck and opportunities to safely change lanes if the truck's behavior suggests a longer delay, such as turning or stopping. Additionally, the ego car should use its headlights effectively to ensure it is visible to other road users and to enhance its own visibility of the road ahead. Maintain a safe distance from the truck, reduce speed due to potentially slick road conditions, and continuously monitor the truck's brake lights for signs of stopping or slowing down to adjust the ego car's following distance and speed accordingly."
