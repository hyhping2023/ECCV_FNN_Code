Further ahead, there are several vehicles, including cars, which contribute to the traffic density and could affect the ego car's use of cruise control, decisions to overtake, and preparedness for sudden stops.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs in the immediate vicinity that require attention, there is a green traffic light ahead on the right for lanes going straight, which suggests that the ego car can maintain its current speed without needing to stop.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed along the median, indicating a work zone or lane obstruction, which means the ego car should remain cautious, anticipating potential changes in traffic patterns or the presence of workers.\n\nMetal barriers are present on the central reservation, separating the opposite lanes of traffic, ensuring that vehicles stay in their respective lanes and limiting the ego car's ability to perform certain maneuvers, such as U-turns.\n\nLastly, a dustbin is located on the edge of the median. While it is not an immediate hazard, its presence is a potential static hazard that the ego car's sensors should monitor in case it becomes dislodged onto the road."
