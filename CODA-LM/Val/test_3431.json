However, there is a vulnerable road user to be cautious of: a small, light-colored dog is in the middle of the road ahead, facing towards the ego car. The presence of the dog is a safety hazard and requires the autonomous vehicle to either slow down or come to a complete stop to avoid a potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign of interest on the right side of the roadâ€”a blue parking sign with a white 'P'. This sign indicates that there is a parking area nearby, suggesting that vehicles may be entering or exiting the parking area. While this does not directly affect the immediate driving behavior, it is important for situational awareness.\n\nThe traffic lights in the distance are green, which under normal circumstances would signal that the vehicle can proceed. However, they are partially obscured by trees, and due to the presence of the dog on the road, the ego vehicle must remain cautious despite the green light.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, which means there are no additional obstructions or hazards in the immediate vicinity that the ego car needs to navigate around or be aware of at this moment."

Monitoring the green traffic light ensures that when it is safe to move forward, the ego vehicle can continue its journey. Maintaining vigilance for any possible small obstacles or changes in the traffic light is also advised."
