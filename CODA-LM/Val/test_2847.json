        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a white SUV positioned on the right side of the road. The presence of this vehicle reduces the available road width for itself and may obstruct the view or movement of other road users, such as pedestrians who might emerge from between parked vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are red barriers aligned along the sidewalk on the right side of the road, with some extending into the street. These barriers signal the presence of construction areas or closed-off sections, which may result in a narrower path for vehicles to navigate, necessitating extra caution.\n\nFurthermore, there is a tree situated on the sidewalk ahead that partially obstructs the view. While the tree is not on the road itself, its presence is significant as it requires drivers to be more vigilant to maintain clear visibility of the road ahead and to be aware of any potential hazards that might be concealed by the foliage."

    "driving_suggestion": "When the green light is on, if there are no other road users or obstacles on the straight path ahead, the vehicle should continue to move forward smoothly. The presence of traffic cones and obstacles signals the need to be more vigilant and may require a reduction in speed due to nearby road construction or lane restrictions. The vehicle should monitor for any signs of road users or changes in road conditions that may necessitate adjustments to the driving path or speed. Due to vehicles parked on the right side of the road, the vehicle should reduce speed and proceed with extreme caution, maintaining a safe distance. If it is necessary to avoid areas marked by cones, prepare to change lanes to the left, and comply with any road changes indicated by the obstacles. Pay close attention to the traffic lights, especially for changes in their status, and be prepared to yield to emergency vehicles when they are moving. Drive cautiously due to the uncertain status of the traffic lights ahead. If the light turns red, be prepared to stop. Maintain a safe distance from the red vehicle on the right in case it starts moving. Be careful of obstacles that partially block the driving lane and navigate around them carefully. Due to wet roads, slow down and increase the following distance. As traffic signs become visible and clear, follow any instructions. At night, stay alert for unexpected movements or road users in areas with poor visibility.",
