Overtaking may be considered if it's legally allowed and if the ego car can safely pass the truck with clear visibility of the oncoming lane. Continuously assess the truck's speed and indications to anticipate any potential maneuvers it might make. Additionally, keep vigilant for any debris that might fall off the truck, adjusting distance and speed as needed to ensure safety."
