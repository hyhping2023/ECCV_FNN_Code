        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, we observe a white car directly in front of the ego vehicle sharing the same lane, slightly offset to the left. Given the green traffic light, the car looks prepared to move forward. This white car's position and behavior are essential for the ego car because they will determine the appropriate following distance and any needed speed adjustment to keep a safe distance.\n\nSurrounding the ego car, there are multiple other cars spanning adjacent lanes, showing a variety of colors and either advancing or waiting to advance, following the green traffic light. The presence of these cars is a cue for the ego car to maintain its lane with caution and to stay alert for any potential lateral movements from these vehicles.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, a motorcyclist is noted wearing a high-visibility jacket and slightly ahead in position. This requires the ego car to be extra prudent and ensure a safer distance is kept, acknowledging that motorcycles have different dynamics, such as a shorter stopping distance and lower visibility, compared to cars.\n\nAbove, ahead of the ego vehicle, there are directional traffic signs visible that supply navigational cues. While these signs don't influence immediate driving behavior, they are indeed crucial for long-term route planning.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, the traffic light is observed showing a green signal. This signifies that the ego car, along with the other vehicles in front of it, should be ready to proceed.\n\nAlongside, bright orange traffic cones are placed on the right, clearly setting a boundary that vehicles should not cross. These cones indicate a defined limit to the driving lane and signal the ego car to remain within the designated driving space.\n\nLastly, a chain of white plastic barriers connected by pink poles is set up on the right side of the road, denoting either a construction zone or a closed-off section of the road. This underscores to the ego car the importance of sticking to the current lane due to the partial road closure or maintenance activity.\n\nNo other objects of significance are present in the image that would influence the driving conditions for the ego car."
