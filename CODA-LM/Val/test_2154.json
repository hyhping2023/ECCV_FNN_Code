Reduce speed to ensure a safe stopping distance within the range of visibility. 2. Use appropriate lighting (such as headlights, and fog lights if available) to improve visibility. 3. Rely on other vehicle sensors (such as LiDAR or radar), which can detect obstacles and road users that the cameras cannot see. 4. If the sensors are impaired or conditions deteriorate to the point where safe driving cannot be guaranteed, safely pull over to the side of the road. Only continue driving when visibility improves or the device functionality is restored.",

This vehicle is moving on the same roadway as the ego car and is within the ego car's field of vision. The visibility of the vehicle's lights suggests that it is either in front of or moving alongside the ego vehicle. The presence of this vehicle is important to consider for maintaining a safe following distance, avoiding collisions, and adhering to traffic regulations that pertain to vehicle interactions on the road. Appropriate adjustments in speed or lane position may be required to safely account for this vehicle's position.",
