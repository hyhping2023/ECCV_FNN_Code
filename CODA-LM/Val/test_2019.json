The truck displays reflective safety markings and has its brake lights illuminated, indicating that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This truck significantly influences the ego car's driving behavior by dictating the speed and stopping distance required. Its large size also restricts visibility of the road ahead for the ego car.\n\nOn the back of the truck, there is a sign with the text 'Operation in progress, keep clear,' although it is partially obstructed by dirt. This suggests that the truck may be involved in road works or a moving operation, which could lead to sudden stops or reduced speed.\n\nTo the left side of the toll booth lanes, two traffic cones are marking the boundary of the toll booth area, indicating the transition into the toll collecting zone and the need to reduce speed. These cones help direct traffic through the toll booth safely and indicate where the ego car should not go, as well as signal possible lane narrowing.\n\nAcross multiple lanes of the toll booth, barrier arms are in the down position, likely indicating that vehicles should stop and wait for the barriers to lift before proceeding. These barriers are a control mechanism for the toll booth, requiring the ego vehicle to come to a complete stop if the barrier is down in its lane.\n\nAdditionally, there is a booth to the left, which is part of the toll booth infrastructure and possibly houses toll workers or automated toll collection equipment. The presence of this booth indicates that this is a controlled pass-through area, which requires the ego car to stop or slow down to pay the toll before proceeding."
