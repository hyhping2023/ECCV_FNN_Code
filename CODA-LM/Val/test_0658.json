These parked vehicles don't actively threaten the autonomous vehicle's path as they are stationary. However, their presence does narrow the driving path, as the vehicle must consider the reduced number of available lanes.\n\nAdditionally, adjacent to the parked cars, there is a noticeable pile of debris and scattered trash on the road. This could potentially block the vehicle's passage, necessitating a deviation from the usual driving route to ensure safe navigation around the obstacles. \n\nThe absence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers indicate that these elements are not present in the current field of view, which means they have no impact on driving decisions at this moment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility and potential road obstacles, drivers should reduce speed and increase the following distance from the vehicle ahead. Stay alert and anticipate sudden behavioral changes of vehicles ahead that may be caused by debris on the road. If necessary, be prepared to change lanes after confirming that the adjacent lane is clear of traffic to avoid blocked sections caused by parked vehicles and debris. Drive cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from roadside debris to avoid potential dangers. If needed, slow down and safely navigate around the trash, especially if it encroaches on the driving lane. Remain vigilant for any unexpected obstacles that may be hidden in piles of trash, or any movements that may indicate the presence of animals or other road users obstructed by debris.",

It is situated on the side of a road and may potentially obstruct part of the pathway or indicate an area where pedestrians might be present as they may approach to dispose of additional items. The presence of garbage on or near the driving path requires the ego car to ensure that its route is unobstructed, necessitating potential adjustment in the driving path to maintain a safe distance from the garbage. Additionally, the ego car should be vigilant for any unexpected pedestrian movement in this area.",
