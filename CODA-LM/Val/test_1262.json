        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large maintenance vehicle positioned in the center lane ahead of the ego car, characterized by its flashing warning lights. This implies potential road work or an obstruction ahead, and given the vehicle's location and active warning signals, it may be moving slowly or stationary, which could disrupt the normal flow of traffic. Additionally, a traffic light is visible in the distance, displaying a green signal. This green light suggests that the ego vehicle has the clearance to proceed. However, due caution is advised due to the presence of the road maintenance vehicle further up the road. Moreover, there's a white roadside barrier on the right side, marking the boundary of the current driving lane. This barrier serves to delineate the driving lane clearly but also limits the ego car's ability to switch lanes to the right, possibly due to the lane's closure or a safety precaution in place. Interestingly, the image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or any other objects that might affect driving behavior, apart from those described."

Due to the presence of this vehicle, the ego car should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance and being prepared for possible road obstructions or changes in traffic flow. The ego car should also be attentive to any signals or directions from road workers or temporary traffic signs that may be placed near the vehicle.",
