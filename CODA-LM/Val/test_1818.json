        "description and explanation": "The scene observed in the traffic image can be summarized as follows:\n\nThere is a large yellow crane truck positioned on the right lane of the road, occupying its full width and with part of its equipment extending slightly into the left lane. The significant size of the crane truck and the slight overhang into the adjacent lane may impact the drivable space available for the ego car. This situation could force the ego car to either slow down or switch lanes in order to maintain a safe distance and prevent a sideswipe collision with the crane truck.\n\nAdditionally, there are several cars driving ahead of the ego car, distributed across the left and center lanes and at various distances. The placement and speed of these vehicles are crucial as they determine the safe distance the ego car should maintain behind them and may provide or restrict lane-changing opportunities. Monitoring the behavior of these cars is essential for anticipating any changes in their speed or lane, which helps in preserving a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the highway, protective barriers are installed, serving the purpose of dividing the roadway from the sidewalk and the adjacent residential area. These barriers act as a guide for the ego car, indicating that the entrance of road users from the right side is not possible, thereby shaping the drivable path and preventing the ego car from veering into non-traffic zones.\n\nThere are also concrete barriers lined up along the roadside to the left. These barriers explicitly demarcate the boundary of the road on the left side, limiting any potential maneuvers by the ego car in that direction.\n\nIn this scene, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects present, which simplifies the driving scenario to some extent by reducing the number of factors the ego car needs to consider while navigating through the traffic."

Heavy construction vehicles like this one are commonly used in construction and infrastructure projects for tasks such as lifting heavy materials. On the road, such vehicles can affect traffic flow due to their size and weight. An ego car must maintain an adequate distance from them to ensure safety as their large size may obscure visibility and they can make sudden movements or stops for operational reasons.",

Monitor the speeds and distances of the vehicles ahead to adjust speed accordingly. Be prepared to change lanes if the lane becomes obstructed or if it is safe and necessary to overtake the crane truck, keeping in mind the check for any relevant traffic signs or signals that might be present but not visible in this image. Continue to follow the road markings and stay aware of barriers to understand the boundaries of the drivable area. Given the presence of the heavy vehicle partially in the same lane, the ego car should assess the adjacent lanes to prepare for a potential lane change. If the next lane to the left is clear, the ego car should signal, check for other vehicles, and smoothly change lanes to maintain safe following distance and prevent any hazardous situation. If the ego car cannot change lanes safely, it must reduce speed to maintain a larger gap with the crane truck until it is safe to overtake."
