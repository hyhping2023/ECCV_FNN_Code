        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are influencing the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle. \n\nFirstly, there is a white car positioned on the front left side, which is partially occupying the driving lane. This vehicle poses a potential obstruction, requiring our car to either slow down or change lanes to avoid it. \n\nAdditionally, a blue truck is parked on the right side, facing away from our vehicle. Although it is not moving, there is a possibility that it could enter the traffic flow, prompting our vehicle to stay vigilant and ready to react if necessary.\n\nAhead on the left, the road is partially blocked by multiple vehicles, including a blue truck that has either stopped or is moving slowly. The presence of these vehicles indicates that our car should be ready to either come to a stop or adjust its speed accordingly, as they may start moving or other vehicles may join the traffic from the side.\n\nA green truck is also present in the image, located directly in front of our vehicle on the same lane and moving in the same direction. The size and position of the truck limit visibility and maneuverability, making it crucial for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user in the scene: a person riding a motorcycle on the right side of the road, traveling in the opposite direction to our vehicle. The motorcyclist requires a safe passing distance, which means our vehicle may need to slow down or move to the left to overtake safely.\n\nLastly, there is a green trash can near the parked cars on the right side of the alley. While it is not currently a roadblock, there is a risk that it could be moved or tipped over onto the road, which would create a hazard.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the white car ahead. If the road ahead is obstructed, be prepared to change lanes. Pay attention to any indications that parked buses and trucks may be moving into your lane. Control your speed to safely respond to any unexpected movements from motorcycles or tuk-tuks. If there is enough safe distance from the adjacent lane, you may slightly turn left to avoid the trash bins on the right. Under the current circumstances, our vehicle should keep a safe distance from the green truck ahead, staying alert to any changes in its speed or direction. Be careful when overtaking and ensure the adjacent lane is clear. Leave ample space for cyclists when passing them. Continue to monitor parked vehicles in case they make sudden movements, and be wary of trash bins that might pose obstacles. It is also advisable to maintain a moderate speed to safely respond to any unforeseen obstacles or situations. Our vehicle should keep a moderate speed while adhering to the right-of-way rules, ready to adjust its position within the lane to safely overtake parked vehicles on the right and vehicles on the left, maintaining an appropriate following distance. When overtaking cyclists, ensure there is a safe passing distance and be mindful of any further obstructions, especially near trash bins on the right. Continuous monitoring of the road and the immediate environment is crucial for safely navigating through this scenario.",

The tricycle is positioned on the road and appears to be stationary or moving slowly.
