        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large red truck towing a flatbed trailer occupying the lane immediately to the left of the autonomous car, situated slightly in front and moving in the same direction. The presence of this truck is significant as it could block the autonomous vehicle's view on the left side, possibly affecting lane change decisions and necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance to avoid any incidents.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones have been set up in a line along the right side of the road, suggesting the possibility of a closed lane or ongoing road work ahead. This arrangement indicates that there will be a deviation from the normal driving pattern, requiring the autonomous vehicle to potentially alter its lane position or decelerate to navigate the area safely.\n\nAlongside the cones, a continuous yellow barrier is running parallel on the far right side of the road. This barrier confirms that there is a section of the roadway that is not available for vehicle use, which might be due to roadwork or lane closures, further emphasizing a need for altered driving behavior to ensure safety and adherence to road regulations."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck on the left, being prepared for it to make sudden movements or stops due to its larger size and potential blind spots. Stay alert for any changes in the right lane indicated by the traffic cones and barriers, and remain in the current lane unless road signs or conditions suggest that a lane change is necessary. Reduce speed appropriately if the roadworks affect the traffic flow."
