A red flatbed truck with a large load is parked on the right side of the road, facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle. This truck may obstruct part of the lane, requiring the ego vehicle to navigate carefully around it.\n  2. A white car is ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance due to the presence of this car.\n  3. Several vehicles are on the opposite side of the road, facing towards the ego vehicle. Monitoring these oncoming vehicles is essential in case any of them cross the median or turn into the ego vehicle's path.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n  - Pedestrians are walking along the sidewalk on the right side. Although they are not on the road, their proximity means the ego vehicle should remain vigilant in case they step onto the road.\n\n- **Traffic Cones:**\n  - Orange traffic cones are placed in the center lane, diverting traffic into a single lane for both directions. These cones narrow the drivable path and guide the flow of traffic, indicating that the ego vehicle must merge into the appropriate lane while yielding to oncoming traffic.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."

The speed should be reduced appropriately to safely navigate around the potential hazard presented by the parked flatbed truck. Monitor oncoming traffic for any erratic movements due to the narrowed road space. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes to the left, away from the obstruction after checking for any oncoming traffic or hazards in the other lane. The driver should signal intent to merge left early to communicate the maneuver to other road users and to safely navigate around the flatbed trailer and the traffic cones."
