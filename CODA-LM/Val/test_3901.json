Maintain a slower speed to cope with reduced visibility during nighttime driving. Be prepared for possible lane closures or diversions due to the construction. Continuous observation of any changes in the road environment is suggested, and obeying any temporary traffic signs or signals that may be present but not visible in this image is essential. Watch for any indications of the parked vehicles attempting to enter traffic, and be prepared to stop or maneuver if necessary. Keep within the lane boundaries, considering the metal barriers on the right side. Stay alert for any potential road signs that might appear and provide further instructions."
