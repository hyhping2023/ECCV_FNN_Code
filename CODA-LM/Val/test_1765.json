This vehicle is partially blocking the lane closest to the curb, which may significantly reduce the drivable width for other vehicles. The position of the parked sedan is of particular importance because, in situations where vehicles are coming from the opposite direction, this sedan could pose as an obstacle, potentially affecting the flow of traffic and requiring drivers to navigate around it with caution. The rest of the traffic elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not feature in this specific traffic image, suggesting a relatively clear path except for the mentioned parked vehicle."

Additionally, the vehicle should be prepared to stop if necessary and ensure there is enough distance from parked vehicles and oncoming traffic to pass safely.
