This large vehicle blocking the view ahead may affect the safe driving of our car and is a key factor in the decision-making process.\n   - **White SUV**: A white SUV is crossing the intersection at a moderate speed, positioned to the front left of the vehicle.

These road users necessitate cautious driving when approaching or maneuvering around them, emphasizing the importance of checking blind spots and mirrors when changing lanes or turning.\n   - **Pedestrians**: Pedestrians are seen crossing the street in the distance from beyond the sidewalk. Their movement and position may affect traffic flow and require cautious driving.\n   - **Group of Pedestrians and Motorcyclists**: Across the intersection, a group of pedestrians and motorcyclists are either crossing or waiting to cross the road. Their presence requires caution and preparedness to stop or yield, particularly if they suddenly enter the vehicle's path."

At the same time, be prepared to yield to the white SUV and pedestrians, while closely monitoring their movements. If the traffic light becomes visible and displays a red light, our vehicle must come to a complete stop. Otherwise, proceed with caution, obey the right-of-way rules, and remain vigilant, ready to respond to any intent signals emitted by the white SUV or vulnerable road users. Also, pay attention to the driving behavior of the white sedan to be well-prepared for potential lane changes, ensuring safety as the priority.",
