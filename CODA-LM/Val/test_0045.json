        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene contains several elements that impact the decision-making of the autonomous driving system of the ego car. Ahead, in the same lane, there is a white sedan that has its brake lights on, signaling a slow down or a stop. This sedan directly affects the ego car's movement, necessitating careful distance-keeping and readiness to respond when the traffic situation changes. In the right lane, a stationary bus with its brake lights on may obstruct the view ahead and requires cautious distance monitoring due to its size.\n\nA motorcyclist on the far right is also moving in the same direction as the ego car. The motorcyclist's greater vulnerability and potential unpredictability in movements mean the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be vigilant of any sudden changes.\n\nMounted to the left under an overpass are traffic signs including a no parking sign and directional information, which provide general road rules and route guidance. Additionally, overhead directional signs are indicating lane destinations and may influence the ego car's lane choice if a turn is intended.\n\nThe traffic lights are currently green as seen above the sedan, granting the ego car permission to proceed once the sedan moves. However, the ego car is required to stay alert and be prepared to stop if the lights change and cannot proceed immediately due to the stationary sedan in front.\n\nOn the road's right side, red and white traffic cones form a line, closing off access to that lane and guiding the ego car to maintain its current lane, staying alert for potential obstructions or merging traffic.\n\nOther elements include blue construction barriers on the opposite side of the road, which would necessitate awareness of possible disruptions, and fences with a guardrail that provide separation between the roadway and the pedestrian area on the right, indicating that cross-traffic in this area is unlikely and suggesting a more predictable flow of traffic.\n\nThe barriers category does not contain any elements affecting the scenario and is, therefore, not considered in the driving strategy."

The presence of a bus directly in front of the ego car indicates that the ego car must maintain a safe following distance. In this scenario, since the view ahead is obscured by the bus, additional caution is advised. The ego car may need to be prepared to stop if the bus stops suddenly to pick up or drop off passengers.

It should also be prepared to slow down if the traffic light changes or if there are any unexpected movements from road users, such as the sedan or motorcyclist. Caution should be exercised due to the nearby construction indicated by barriers. Given the red traffic light, the ego car should come to a complete stop behind the white sedan, ensuring a safe distance. Caution should be maintained when observing the bus and the motorcyclist, as they may obstruct visibility or make sudden movements. Remain observant for the green traffic light and any indications from the road work section marked by cones. Prepare for a smooth and safe acceleration once the light turns green, considering the traffic ahead and adhering to the no-left-turn sign. Monitor the sedan ahead closely and prepare to advance when it moves, as the traffic light is green. Be aware of the bus in the adjacent lane to avoid side collision or unintentional lane merging. Keep a safe distance from the motorcyclist and be cautious of their potential lateral movements. Stay in the appropriate lane for the intended route, adhering to directional signs and avoid the coned-off area to the right."
