Due to its size and the special nature of its cargo, the truck may move slower or make unexpected maneuvers, thus requiring increased following distance and attention from the ego car."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, the ego car is facing a large yellow construction vehicle which is being transported on the back of a truck directly in front. The construction vehicle has its rear safety lights on, along with visible warning signs. This indicates that the truck may be slow-moving or stationary and could constitute an obstacle, necessitating that the ego car either slows down or changes lanes to maintain a safe following distance. Due to the large size of the load and the potential for unexpected maneuvers, increased vigilance and an extended following distance by the ego car are warranted.\n\nOn the right side of the road, on the sidewalk, there are pedestrians who appear to be waiting without the intent to cross the street at the moment. Even though they are not currently a direct hazard, they should be carefully watched by the autonomous systems of the ego car in case they start crossing unexpectedly, which could pose a traffic concern.\n\nA traffic light controlling the ego car's lane shows a green light, granting the right of way to proceed. However, caution is recommended because of the construction vehicle's presence and the adjacent pedestrians. Despite the green light, any change in behavior by these road users could require the ego car to adjust its driving behavior for safety. It is important to note that there is also a red traffic light visible, indicating the need for the vehicles in the affected lane, including the truck ahead, to stop.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."

While the green light indicates the right of way, the driver should remain vigilant for the movements of pedestrians on the sidewalk. It would be prudent to check mirrors and blind spots before any lane change, to ensure that the move can be made safely. Additionally, the ego car must yield to the pedestrians on the zebra crossing until they have completely crossed the road. The driver should also prepare to stop due to the red traffic light ahead and keep an eye on the pedestrians to the right, especially if any of them show intent to cross the road. It is essential to be cautious and ready to yield to pedestrians at the crossing."
