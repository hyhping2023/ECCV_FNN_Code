        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are three road users categorized as vehicles, which have implications for the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nFirstly, there is a large tow truck or maintenance vehicle positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. It's equipped with visible warning lights and reflective markings. The implication for the ego car is the need for maintaining a safe following distance, given that the tow truck may be moving slowly or stopping frequently, which would require the ego car to be prepared to reduce speed or stop altogether.\n\nSecondly, a red semi-trailer is noted on the left side of the ego car, though it is only partially visible. Due to the truck's large size and its placement in an adjacent lane, the semi-trailer impacts the ego car's ability to change lanes or perform other maneuvers safely.\n\nLastly, a sedan is observed to the right side of the ego car, identified by its active brake lights. This indicates that the sedan is either in the process of slowing down or has come to a stop, which may be indicative of traffic congestion or an upcoming hazard, thus alerting the ego car to the possibility of needing to slow down or stop as well.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the tow truck, staying alert to its potential stops or reduced speed. Monitor adjacent lanes for vehicles like the red semi-trailer and sedan, which could influence the ego car's ability to change lanes safely. Be prepared for possible traffic congestion ahead as indicated by the sedan's brake lights. Continue to observe the environment for any traffic signs, lights, or changes in road conditions that might appear. Due to low visibility, keep the headlights on (if not automatic) and reduce speed to ensure adequate reaction time to unforeseen events."
