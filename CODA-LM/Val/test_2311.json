The presence of the construction vehicle and traffic cones suggests that there may be roadworks or a temporary road layout change which may require merging into an adjacent lane. If the adjacent lane is clear, the ego car should indicate its intention to merge and do so safely. If there are vehicles in the adjacent lane, the ego car should adjust its speed to find a safe gap to merge into. Always maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speed. Additionally, drive cautiously due to the wet road conditions that may affect traction."
