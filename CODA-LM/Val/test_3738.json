Given the relative proximity and shared path of travel, caution is advised, particularly when considering right-lane changes or any adjustments to the driving path. This awareness is vital to ensure there is enough room to make such maneuvers safely.\n\nAdditionally, pedestrians are present on the sidewalk to the right of our vehicle. Since pedestrian movements can be unpredictable and there's a chance they could step onto the roadway, it's important to keep a watchful eye on them to maintain safety.\n\nFurthermore, a barrier has been noted between the road and the sidewalk on the vehicle's right. The barrier serves to decrease the likelihood of pedestrians from unpredictably entering the roadway from the sidewalk. Despite this reduced risk, it remains important to stay alert to any potential movements or changes in the environment.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this traffic scene that would impact the driving behavior of the autonomous car."
