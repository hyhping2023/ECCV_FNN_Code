        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that the autonomous vehicle must consider:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A white car is positioned directly in front of the self-driving vehicle, moving across the vehicle's path. The self-driving car must consider changing lanes or adjusting its speed to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle.\n2. A blue van is driving towards the autonomous vehicle on the opposite side of the road. The autonomous vehicle needs to monitor the van's trajectory to ensure it remains in its lane and does not present a collision risk.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A motorcyclist is traveling ahead in the right lane, moving in the same direction as the self-driving car. Since motorcyclists are less visible and more prone to injuries, it is crucial for the autonomous vehicle to keep a safe distance and be ready for any sudden movements.\n2. A pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk to the right and is nearing the edge of the crosswalk. The self-driving vehicle should be prepared to yield, as the pedestrian might decide to cross the road.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. There is a speed limit sign on the right, which is a circular blue sign with a red border and the number \"20\" in the center. This sign indicates that the vehicle should not exceed 20 kilometers per hour.\n2. Behind the pedestrian crosswalk on the right side of the road, there is a \"No Parking\" sign, indicating that parking is not allowed near the sign.\n\nBarriers:\nA barrier is installed on the right side of the sidewalk, creating a separation between pedestrians and the road. This barrier delineates a controlled pedestrian area, reducing the chance of pedestrians accidentally stepping onto the road in this section.\n\nOther Objects:\nThere is a stationary motorcycle parked on the sidewalk to the right. While the parked motorcycle does not directly impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, it is important to be vigilant for any unexpected activity in the vicinity.\n\nThe traffic scene does not contain any traffic lights or traffic cones."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, while keeping an eye on its speed, and stay alert for the white vehicle on the opposite lane. As you approach the area indicated by traffic signs, slow down to the 20 km/h speed limit. Be mindful of pedestrians crossing the street, and take note of parked bicycles and motorcycles, as they may indicate that pedestrians or cyclists might enter the road. Overall, practice defensive driving, adhere to speed limits, and be constantly vigilant for unexpected maneuvers from motorcyclists, cyclists, and other road users.",
