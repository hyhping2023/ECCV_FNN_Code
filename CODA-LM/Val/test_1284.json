Firstly, there is a cyclist riding on the right side of the road in the same direction as our vehicle. The cyclist's proximity to our lane may affect safe maneuvering and the required clearing distance. Secondly, there is a temporary barrier made up of panels set at various angles to the right of a blue sign. This barrier is blocking part of the road, which may reduce the available width of the roadway, or indicate nearby road construction or temporary hazards. There are no other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

While driving, be vigilant of bicycles on the left side, leaving ample space for them and being cautious of their potentially unpredictable movements. Since roadblocks may indicate narrowing roads or obstacles, drivers should be prepared to slow down and carefully navigate around them. Continuously observe changes in other road users or road conditions in the environment to ensure driving safety.",
