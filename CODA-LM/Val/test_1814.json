        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, various road users and objects are present, each affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in specific ways. \n\nFirstly, there are parked cars on the right side of the road, both white and gray, aligned parallel to the curb. These parked vehicles necessitate that the ego car maintains a safe distance while passing to avoid potential hazards such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging from between the cars. Additionally, various bicycles are parked on the side of the road, to the right of the ego vehicle. Although these bicycles are stationary, their proximity to the driving path requires vigilant monitoring by the ego car to anticipate if someone might enter the road to access them.\n\nA pedestrian, dressed in a black jacket and jeans and pulling a blue cart with boxes, is observed crossing the road from right to left ahead of the ego car. This pedestrian's presence directly in the path of the ego car presents an immediate need for the vehicle to slow down or stop to ensure safe passage.\n\nIn terms of traffic control devices, no traffic lights are visible in the image. This absence indicates that the ego car must navigate the traffic scenario based on road markings, signs, and adherence to right-of-way rules without the guidance of traffic lights.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road next to the parked cars and bicycles. These cones likely denote a separation from the parking area or a potential construction zone, advising the ego vehicle to remain in its lane and avoid drifting towards the cones.\n\nFurthermore, white and red barriers are positioned on the right side of the road, in front of the parked bicycles, suggesting a restricted area or ongoing work. The ego car is advised to pass these barriers with caution, keeping a safe distance. Metal barriers are also present, lining the median that separates opposite lanes of traffic. These barriers serve to ensure that vehicles stay within their designated lanes and prevent any accidental crossing into oncoming traffic lanes.\n\nThis comprehensive overview of the traffic scene highlights the importance of the ego car's awareness and responsiveness to various road users and objects to navigate safely."
