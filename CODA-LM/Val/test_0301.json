This car requires caution for sudden movement or door opening. A light-colored SUV is situated in the left lane facing the opposite direction with no immediate interaction expected, but monitoring its speed and movements is crucial. Additionally, several cars are parked on the side of the road after the intersection, posing no immediate threat but needing observation in case they start moving.\n\nIn the \"traffic signs\" category, a blue sign on the left indicates an approaching intersection with a countdown timer, signaling the vehicle to prepare for potential merging traffic. A \"No Parking\" sign on the right side of the intersection and another no parking sign on the traffic light pole ahead inform about parking restrictions to avoid obstructions. A speed limit sign marked \"50\" above the \"No Parking\" sign instructs adherence to the speed limit for safety and legal compliance.\n\nIn the \"traffic lights\" category, a green light ahead signals the lane is clear for driving, though vigilance for changes in signals is needed as the vehicle approaches the intersection. Moreover, the green light for straight-going and left-turn lanes indicates that the vehicle can either go straight or turn left at the intersection.\n\nIn the \"traffic cones\" category, cones with alternating yellow and black patterns are placed on both sides of the pedestrian crosswalk area, which may indicate areas to be avoided and suggest caution. Additionally, yellow and red striped traffic cones on the right side ensure the safety of pedestrians by delineating the pedestrian crossing area.\n\nLastly, the \"barriers\" category includes a white obstacle placed in the right-hand corner at the far end of the crosswalk, marking boundaries for vehicles and pedestrians to delineate travel paths and encourage safe navigation.\n\nThere are no notable entries for \"vulnerable_road_users\" and \"other objects\" categories in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the current road users and conditions, self-driving vehicles should maintain a safe speed while being ready to stop at any time in case the green traffic light changes. Since the sign on the right lane shows \"No Stopping,\" the vehicle should not stop there. When approaching the intersection ahead, remain alert due to possible merging traffic. Adhere to the 50 km/h speed limit and cautiously pass through the intersection. Pay close attention to the red car on the left to prevent any unexpected movements and avoid the area near the sidewalk marked with traffic cones. Since the traffic light is green and no pedestrian activity has been detected, the self-driving car should proceed with caution, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, and continuously monitor their movements. The \"No Stopping\" sign indicates that the vehicle should keep moving ahead and not stop.",
