        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a white sedan parked on the roadside, positioned perpendicularly to the direction of travel, with its rear end slightly extending into the driving lane. This parked car is reducing the available width of the road, which could potentially limit the maneuverability of autonomous vehicles navigating the area.\n\nAdditionally, there are two orange traffic cones on the road, set up to create a pathway between the parked vehicles and the cones themselves. This arrangement suggests that the lane ahead may be narrowing or that there could be hazards present. As a result, autonomous vehicles should be prepared to decelerate and maneuver cautiously to remain within the altered lane boundaries while avoiding any potential obstacles."

Additionally, remain alert for any potential unexpected obstacles that traffic cones may indicate, and prepare to stop or execute safe maneuvers if necessary. Maintain a safe distance when passing the parked sedan if the road width permits. There is no need to take immediate action for other road users, road signs, traffic lights, or obstacles, as they are not visible or present in the scene.",

It is brightly colored, usually in orange with white horizontal stripes for high visibility. As part of its influence on driving behavior, the presence of a traffic cone requires the ego car to steer clear of the marked area and proceed with caution. It may also signal the likely presence of workers or machinery ahead, necessitating reduced speed and increased vigilance.",
