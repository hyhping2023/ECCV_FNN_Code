Additionally, two motorcyclists are in the same lane on the right side of the road; one is closer to the ego car, and the other is farther ahead, making it important to monitor them closely due to their unpredictable movements.\n\nA red traffic light is visible in the upper right portion of the image, signaling the ego car to remain stopped until the signal changes. White fencing barriers are also present on both sides of the road, separating the roadway from pedestrian areas and guiding the ego car to stay within the correct lane."
