        "description and explanation": "The traffic image contains several non-vehicular obstacles on the road. Notably, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the scene. However, the right side of the road is cluttered with several large industrial spools that are positioned close to the area where vehicles would normally drive. These spools, which appear to be made of metal or hard plastic, pose a potential risk as they might obstruct the path of a vehicle should they roll or be moved onto the drivable portion of the road.\n\nAdditionally, there are smaller pieces of debris and litter interspersed amongst the larger spools. Although these smaller fragments present a less significant hazard, they could still impact a car's traction or potentially cause damage if they were to be run over by the vehicle.\n\nMoreover, there is miscellaneous rubble and general trash located close to the curb. The accumulation of this waste may conceal more dangerous objects and serve as an unwelcome distraction for drivers, which is a safety consideration that must be taken into account.\n\nOverall, the described objects represent a safety risk to the autonomous vehicle, necessitating careful navigation to avoid potential harm or damage."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a large spool, typically used to hold materials such as cables or wires. In a driving environment, such an object could be considered unexpected debris or an obstacle. The presence of this object on or near the roadway would necessitate cautious driving and possible maneuvering to avoid collision. As it is a non-standard object in road situations, it does not influence the driving behavior in a predictable manner like traffic signs or signals would, but it does require attention to ensure safety.",

Be prepared for potential obstacles entering the roadway and stay vigilant for any movement from the larger objects on the roadside. Additionally, the vehicle should be ready to adjust the lateral position within the lane to distance itself safely from the roadside hazards while staying within lane boundaries. It should also be prepared for any sudden stop if debris is found on the driving path."
