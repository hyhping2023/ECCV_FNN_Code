A line of vehicles is visible in front, all with brake lights on, which means the ego car should keep a safe distance and anticipate stop-and-go traffic. There's a white car on the left side with its brake lights on, potentially affecting lane space and merge behavior for the ego car. Additionally, a gray van is moving forward in a neighboring lane on the right, posing a risk if it decides to merge into the ego car's lane.\n\nWhile there are no vulnerable road users present, there are signs to consider. A blue sign indicates a 40 km/h speed limit, and a yellow and blue sign warns of upcoming construction, urging caution. Although the ego car has a green traffic light, it's for an adjacent lane, and the ego car must obey its own signals.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed near construction signs to the ego car's right, marking the work zone and foreshadowing navigation within the driving lane. Barricades and barriers accompany these cones along the right, defining the driving path and signaling drivers to stay left. An additional red and white barrier indicates restricted road access, possibly requiring lane changes.\n\nFinally, construction equipment is seen in the background; it's not currently a hindrance but may lead to unexpected traffic alterations."

Following distance should be increased to allow for safe stopping, and attention should be paid to any temporary traffic signals or directions that might be present because of the construction. Additionally, the ego car should be ready to adjust the lane position to the left to avoid the construction area indicated by the traffic cones and barriers."
