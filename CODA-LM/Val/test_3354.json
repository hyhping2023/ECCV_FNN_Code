Firstly, there is a white car in the same lane ahead of us, which appears to be moving slowly or may come to a stop. As a result, it is important to be prepared to decelerate or stop in order to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a dark-colored SUV parked on the right side of the road, which is partially obstructing the lane. This parked SUV reduces the width of the available lanes and could affect the drivable space for autonomous vehicles. Lastly, a green trash can is situated on the right side of the road, close to the curb. While it does not directly impact driving behavior, it is essential to remain vigilant to avoid any potential unexpected obstacles that might arise from its presence or from debris in the surrounding area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Self-driving vehicles should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and be prepared to adjust speed if the leading vehicle stops or decelerates. Additionally, self-driving vehicles should monitor parked SUVs on the right side to prevent any unexpected movement. Adjust the sensors' sensitivity according to the light changes caused by overcast conditions. Be aware of the SUVs parked on the side of the road; if safe and necessary, the self-driving vehicle should slightly adjust its position to the left within the lane to maintain a safe passing distance. Stay vigilant of any pedestrian activity near the parked SUVs and trash bins. Monitor traffic lights and be ready to respond when the signals are visible. Continue to monitor the road conditions for any additional information, and maintain a speed that is adapted to both the road conditions and traffic regulations. Do not attempt to overtake at this moment, as the situation in front of the parked vehicles and visibility in other lanes are unpredictable. Stay alert to any changes in the environment ahead, which may require driving decisions to be made.",
