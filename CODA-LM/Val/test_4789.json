Firstly, a silver sedan is parked directly in front of the ego car on the right side of the road, adjacent to the sidewalk. The presence of this vehicle requires caution as it could potentially move or open its doors unexpectedly. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or maneuver safely to avoid any incidents.\n\nSecondly, there is a small, light-colored dog on the right side of the road, ahead of the ego car, and it appears to be moving towards the left. The dog represents a potential hazard as it may enter the driving lane. Consequently, the ego car should reduce its speed and be ready to come to a complete stop if necessary to ensure the safety of the animal and prevent any accidents."

Since there are no traffic signs or signals visible, the ego car must rely on direct observation of the environment to make appropriate driving decisions."
