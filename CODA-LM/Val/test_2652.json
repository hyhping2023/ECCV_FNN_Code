This uncertainty could affect the driving behavior of the autonomous car as it approaches the intersection, since it is difficult to accurately determine the state of the traffic light. Traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, illuminated by the vehicle's headlights, and are arranged in a taper layout, indicating a possible lane closure or roadworks ahead. The ego car will need to adjust its path to avoid these cones. Additionally, there are yellow and black striped barriers that delineate a no-entry zone straight ahead, signaling that the road is closed to traffic. This will require the ego car to either stop or find an alternative route. There are no traffic signs or other objects reported in the image."

Ensure headlights and street lighting are used to improve visibility. Reduce speed, and prepare to change lanes if the lane is obstructed by the barriers or if directed by traffic signs or signals that are not visible in the image. If there is a detour in place, follow the detour signs carefully."
