This vehicle needs to be monitored to ensure it is safe for the ego car to move forward.\n- A cement mixer truck is crossing from left to right in the intersection, potentially obstructing the ego carâ€™s view or path. Its large size and direction are crucial since it may have the right of way.\n- Several stationary vehicles are waiting for the traffic signal in the opposite lane, indicating potential traffic flow conditions and possible congestion.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users:\n- A motorcycle with a sidecar is directly ahead and appears to be in motion. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to respond to any sudden movements by the motorcyclist.\n\nTraffic lights:\n- The traffic light at the intersection is green for the ego car, permitting it to go straight, while the signal for the left turn lane is red. The green light allows the vehicle to proceed straight or turn when legally permitted, whereas the red light requires vehicles to stop and wait for the signal change."

When passing through an intersection, proceed with caution. Be prepared to slow down if necessary, especially if the cement mixer or other vehicles create any obstructions. Moreover, if you intend to turn right, exercise extra caution given the presence of a tricycle on the right side.",
