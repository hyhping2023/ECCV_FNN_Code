Additionally, a small dog is present on the road in the distance, which could behave unpredictably and may require the ego car to stop or slow down suddenly.

Be especially attentive for any pedestrians that might be obscured from view by the parked cars. Given the wet road conditions, increase braking distances and maintain a lower speed to prevent skidding. Stay alert for any indications of vehicles pulling out from the parking spaces. Reduce speed to account for the reduced road width due to parked vehicles, maintain a vigilant watch for the pedestrian and the dog that may enter the roadway, and exercise caution due to wet road conditions which may affect vehicle handling and stopping distances. The ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary and drive at a speed that allows for safe reaction to unexpected road users."
