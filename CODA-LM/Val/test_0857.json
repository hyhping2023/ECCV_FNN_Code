These parked vehicles do not directly influence the dynamic scenario for the ego vehicle. However, the driver must remain cautious for any potential movement or doors opening from these vehicles.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:** There are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in this image. This absence means that normal caution can be maintained without the need for specific actions related to these vulnerable road users.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs:** No traffic signs are visible that provide specific instructions or restrictions. Consequently, the ego car must rely on general road rules and environmental context for decision-making.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights:** There are no traffic lights visible in the image. The absence of traffic lights suggests that this area might be less regulated, such as a parking lot, requiring the ego car to be vigilant and look for other navigational and safety cues.\n\n5. **Traffic Cones:** Yellow and black striped traffic cones are lined up on the right side, leading to a tented area. These cones indicate a change in the expected traffic pattern, directing the ego car to avoid certain areas and suggesting a temporary or makeshift traffic route.\n\n6. **Other Objects:** There is a permanent structure resembling a guard booth on the right, along with a temporary tented setup, which could be for a check-in or security point. The ego car should be mindful of potential pedestrian movements and activities around these structures, which could necessitate slowing down or stopping."
