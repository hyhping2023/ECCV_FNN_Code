        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene comprises various road users and objects that influence driving behavior and necessitate cautious navigation. First, there are several vehicles identified; parked along the right side of the road, these vehicles are stationary and reduce the usable road width while potentially obstructing the view of other road users. Further ahead in the same lane, a red vehicle with its lights on suggests movement or an intention to move shortly, indicating a need for maintaining a safe-following distance.\n\nVulnerable road users present include a pedestrian standing by a small cart filled with fruits and vegetables, presenting a direct collision hazard requiring careful attention. Additionally, a cyclist wearing reflective, bright-colored clothing and riding along the right side of the pathway emphasizes the need for cautious overtaking and maintaining a safe distance at all times.\n\nThe area has a parking sign indicating parking restrictions, which, while not directly affecting driving behavior, suggests a densely populated zone where vehicles might stop or pull out abruptly, requiring vigilance.\n\nFurthermore, a street vendor's cart, brightly lit and parked by the roadside, represents a stationary obstacle. Such objects require autonomous vehicles to remain alert to avoid collisions, ensuring the safety of both pedestrians and cyclists, alongside navigating around the static obstruction safely.\n\nThis traffic scene outlines the necessity for autonomous vehicles to comprehensively process various elements, from stationary and moving vehicles to vulnerable road users and static obstacles, all while adhering to traffic regulations indicated by signs."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to wet road conditions and potential unpredictable behavior, self-driving vehicles should reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance from vehicles ahead. Vehicles should also be prepared to stop or yield to bicycle riders on the right. Moreover, as parking signs indicate an active parking zone, attention should be paid to vehicles that may pull out of parking spots. Self-driving vehicles should navigate with caution, keeping their speed low, to safely respond to the behavior of vehicles ahead and vulnerable road users on the side. In conditions of wet roads, it is advisable to increase the following distance to account for reduced tire traction. If pedestrians or bicyclists make any unpredictable movements, vehicles should also be ready to stop or take evasive action. Furthermore, if the signs' requirements are not met, one should not attempt to park in the designated area on the right. Self-driving vehicles should slow down and prepare to stop to give way to pedestrians crossing the road. They should maintain a cautious speed to have reaction time to cope with unexpected actions from street vendors, parked cars, and bicyclists. After pedestrians have crossed the road, self-driving vehicles should proceed with caution, leave ample space for bicyclists, and monitor any changes in the status of the white vehicle ahead.",
