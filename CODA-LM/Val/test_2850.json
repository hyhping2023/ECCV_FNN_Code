        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario captured by the image, several road users and objects need to be considered for safe and efficient autonomous driving.\n\nFirstly, there are vehicles present:\n1. A heavy-duty truck fitted with a yellow crane is located on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle and occupying the rightmost lane. Trucks may slow down traffic flow or make sudden turns, affecting the number of available lanes and necessitating a safe following distance.\n2. A white sedan is slightly ahead on the right side, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. The behavior and speed of the white sedan will influence the speed adjustment and lane positioning of the self-driving vehicle.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is:\n1. A motorcyclist is located on the left side of the road, traveling in the opposite direction to our vehicle. Motorcyclists may change lanes or be affected by gusts from large vehicles, requiring the self-driving car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to take evasive action.\n\nAdditionally, there are other objects:\n1. Trees and buildings are on both sides of the road, but they do not directly affect the driving behavior of the self-driving vehicle as long as they remain within their designated areas.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image, and therefore these categories are not relevant in this particular scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the large size and unpredictable movements of heavy trucks, please maintain a safe following distance. Be aware of motorcyclists, avoid being in their blind spots by either keeping a safe distance or safely overtaking when necessary. Considering the current traffic conditions, this vehicle should consider safely passing the heavy vehicle from the left after ensuring the left lane is clear, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes due to the possibility of construction vehicles obstructing the traffic. Pay attention to the brake lights and turn signals of the white sedan; they will provide additional information on how to react. If intending to go straight, maintain the current lane. Be ready to adapt to any movements of parked construction vehicles at any time.",

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle equipped with heavy machinery, possibly a crane or heavy-duty equipment for construction purposes. It is stationary on the road and appears to have some of its equipment extending into the lane of the road where the ego car is traveling. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates that there may be construction activity in the vicinity, which typically entails additional precautions for the ego car. Drivers must be prepared for potential hazards, such as workers on the road, slower traffic, or unforeseen obstructions. As the construction vehicle is positioned on the side of the road, it suggests that the ego car should reduce speed, be vigilant for construction signage, maintain a safe distance from the construction site, and be ready to change lanes if necessary to avoid any obstacles or to comply with road diversions related to the construction activity.",
