        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, the ego car is following a large yellow crane mounted on a low-loader truck, which takes up the entire lane ahead and is moving in the same direction. The crane's size and potentially slower pace could impact the ego car's speed and might require a lane change for overtaking if it's safe and legal to do so. It's crucial for the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance for safety and reaction time.\n\nOn the left side of the ego car is a yellow van which seems to be on the move, judged by its proximity and position on the road relative to the ego vehicle. The van could change lanes or adjust its trajectory, so the ego car needs to keep its distance and stay vigilant for any sudden actions from the van.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights visible in the image, it is important for the ego car to continue cautiously, relying on different cues from the environment and other road users to make informed decisions.\n\nMetal barriers situated on the right-hand side of the road act as a divider between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. These barriers suggest that the car should be aware of potential crosswalks or construction areas lying ahead. \n\nWhile there are no vulnerable road users on the road, there is a possibility of pedestrians being present behind the barriers on the road's right side. They are not an immediate concern for the roadway; however, their proximity should keep the ego car's sensors prepared for any unforeseen pedestrian activity."

This vehicle is typically used for lifting heavy materials and has a large, extendable boom arm. In a driving scenario, its presence indicates that there may be construction activity ahead. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary. The driver should be alert for potential movements of the crane or nearby construction workers, as these could affect the flow of traffic.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the crane ahead, be prepared for potentially slower traffic movement due to the oversize load of the crane. If road markings and traffic rules allow, and it is safe to do so, consider changing lanes to the right to overtake the crane when the adjacent lane is clear of other traffic and pedestrians. Keep speed moderate to react adequately to the changing traffic conditions ahead. If a lane change is not possible, be patient and follow the crane at a distance that allows for safe braking. Maintain a safe distance from the van on the left to anticipate any potential lateral movements. Keep a cautious and increased following distance from the crane truck ahead, as it occupies the same lane as the ego car and may cause obstruction or sudden stopping that requires the ego car to react promptly. It is also essential to monitor the surrounding traffic for any changes that may require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes."
