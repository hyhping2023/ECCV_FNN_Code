Both the tail lights and side marker lights are illuminated, indicating that the truck is in motion on the road. It appears to be carrying a structure, presumably an automotive transport trailer, with a clear license plate and potentially heavy equipment on board.",
                "explanation": "The presence and approach of a truck can affect the following distance and speed of one's own vehicle, as it may be necessary to brake or adjust speed based on the truck's movements. The size and load capacity of the truck can limit visibility and increase the required braking distance. Its lighting and reflective markings help enhance the visibility for safety."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, there are two notable vehicles on the road. Directly ahead of our vehicle is a large truck, easily identified by its reflective rear markings. This truck is not stationary; both its tail lights and side marker lights are illuminated, which suggests movement. It seems to be transporting some form of structure, likely an automotive transport trailer, which is evident from its visible license plate and the heavy equipment it appears to be carrying onboard. The presence of this truck is significant for a few reasons. Firstly, it necessitates an adjustment in the following distance and speed of our vehicle. The truck’s size and load can obscure visibility and elongate the required braking distance. Importantly, its equipped lighting and reflective markings are designed to improve visibility, enhancing overall road safety.\n\nAdjacent to our car, to the left, is a white sedan. This vehicle’s brake lights are noticeably active, suggesting it is either decelerating or has come to a complete stop. This observation is crucial as it indicates that the flow of traffic may have halted or slowed significantly, signaling that our vehicle should also be prepared to stop or proceed at a minimal speed to avoid any potential mishap.\n\nIn this observed traffic scenario, no other categories of road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, were reported. This implies that the depicted scene exclusively involves these two vehicles and their direct influence on driving behavior, specifically pertaining to speed adjustment and maintaining a safe following distance based on the observed conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, considering that its size may obscure road obstacles and that it takes longer to stop than smaller vehicles. Monitor the lane-changing behavior of vehicles to the left and right, and be ready to adjust your speed or position to maintain safety. Due to the glare from truck lights and road conditions that are wet or have low reflectivity, reduce your speed if necessary to compensate for decreased visibility, ensuring safe driving. If possible, without compromising safety, consider changing lanes to distance yourself from the truck, which can improve visibility and maneuverability, and execute the maneuver once it is safe to do so.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large commercial vehicle, commonly known as a truck, with a heavy structure and cargo area visible. The presence of this truck influences the ego car's driving behavior by requiring the maintenance of a safe following distance due to the truck's slower acceleration and longer stopping distances. Additionally, visibility around the truck may be limited, so the ego car should proceed with caution and be prepared for sudden changes in the truck's movements.",
