The pedestrians have priority, requiring the ego car to yield and wait for their safe crossing.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**: A pedestrian crossing sign is located on the right side of the intersection and is illuminated by a street light. This sign indicates that pedestrians may be crossing the roadway, necessitating extra caution to ensure their safety.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light directly ahead of the ego car shows green for going straight and a left arrow, while the light for turning right is red. Therefore, the ego car should stop completely and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding and must not turn right due to the red light.\n   - Sidewalk traffic lights are green, allowing pedestrians to cross, confirming that the ego car must remain stopped to let pedestrians cross safely.\n\n5. **Barriers**: Metal barriers are set up on the sidewalk to the right of the scene, separating the pedestrian path from the roadway. These barriers guide pedestrians to cross at designated points and protect them from vehicles. The ego car should avoid veering too close to these barriers.\n\n6. **Other Objects**:\n   - Illuminated street lights along the road provide visibility but mainly indicate that the scene is occurring during the evening or at night, suggesting lower visibility and potentially requiring more caution.\n   - A fence-like barrier to the right of the footpath possibly indicates an area off-limits to pedestrians or channels pedestrian flow. This barrier does not directly affect the ego vehicle but suggests some level of controlled pedestrian movement in this area."
