        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there is a white concrete mixer truck placed on the right side, slightly encroaching into our lane. The truck is adorned with a safety sign and marked with the number 58 on its door. Notably, the vehicle features a mixing drum, which suggests that it is a working vehicle that might make unpredictable movements. As for the implications for our vehicle, the mixer truckâ€™s partial occupation of our lane suggests that the driver may either be attempting to merge or is currently involved in some work-related activities. This positioning poses a potential hazard to the autonomous vehicle as it necessitates careful navigation to avoid an incident.\n\nAdditionally, on the right-hand sidewalk near the concrete mixer truck, a pedestrian is standing. The presence of the pedestrian by itself does not currently pose a direct threat to the vehicle's trajectory. However, the proximity of the pedestrian to the curb necessitates vigilance, as they could potentially decide to enter the roadway unexpectedly, requiring our vehicle to be ready to react accordingly for safe operation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to stop or yield when necessary to allow space for the concrete mixer to complete its maneuver. At the same time, closely watch for pedestrians near the mixer and be ready in case they step onto the road. Our vehicle should cautiously pass the mixer when it is safe to do so, ensuring not to come close to the position of pedestrians. Given the presence of pedestrian crossing signs nearby, drivers should be vigilant for pedestrians who may cross the road, especially as the mixer's presence could make them harder to see. Our vehicle should also signal its intentions clearly and in advance to alert other road users of its intent to turn.",

The driver of the ego car must be cautious as such vehicles often make wide turns and may enter the lane of the ego car. Furthermore, they can obscure traffic ahead due to their size, reducing visibility and reaction time to traffic changes.",
