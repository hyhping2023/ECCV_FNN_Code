        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several road users and objects of note:\n\nThere are three vehicles present. To the left, a large yellow industrial crane truck occupies the adjacent lane, with part of its boom extended upwards and towards the roadside. This truck may affect the traffic flow and potentially cause obstructions or sudden stops when it initiates side operations. Additionally, in the same visual area, there is a light brown van traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Although this van is in another lane, it is crucial to remain vigilant for any of its potential lane changes or speed adjustments. Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a white SUV, indicating that the traffic flow is moving. The presence of this SUV dictates the following distance and speed that our car should maintain to ensure safe driving.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, pedestrians are visible near the crosswalk on the right side of the vehicle, seemingly ready to cross the street. Their proximity to the roadside suggests that they may be about to enter the crosswalk, necessitating that our vehicle be prepared to yield or stop, prioritizing their safety.\n\nIn terms of traffic lights, the light that can be seen ahead is green, granting the right of way to continue passing. Nevertheless, a cautious approach is still warranted to account for other vehicles or road users who might not adhere to the traffic signals.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that have an impact on the driving behavior of the ego car or require further attention."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance behind the white SUV ahead, keep an eye on the crane truck for any signs of movement or operation, and be ready to take evasive action if necessary. Stay alert to the van on the left, in case it decides to merge into the self-driving lane, and watch for pedestrians who may step onto the crosswalk, being prepared to stop and yield. Continue to obey the green traffic light. Drive defensively, ready to respond to dynamic road conditions.",
