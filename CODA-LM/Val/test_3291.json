This truck is partially obstructing the lane, which reduces the drivable width of the road and could potentially hide other road users behind it, necessitating caution while driving.\n\nAdditionally, there are directional signs on the left side of the road. These signs do not directly affect the driving behavior at the moment but provide important route information that is useful for planning the journey ahead.\n\nOn the road, in the right lane, there is a single traffic cone visible, indicating potential hazards or road work ahead. The presence of the cone suggests that the ego vehicle should maintain its position in the left lane to avoid any potential obstacles or areas of road work.\n\nFurthermore, there is some debris or construction materials located on the right, next to the parked truck and the traffic cone. This debris poses a hazard for the ego vehicle and serves as an additional reason to avoid the rightmost lane or to proceed with increased caution."
