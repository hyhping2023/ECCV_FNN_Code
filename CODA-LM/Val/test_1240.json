First, there is a van in the right lane ahead, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This van occupies part of the lane and may obstruct pedestrians or other obstacles appearing from the front or side of the van. Additionally, a stationary white car is positioned head-on in the opposite lane to the left. Although it doesn't immediately affect the driving route, the ego car should monitor it in case it starts moving or turning.\n\nWhite reflective traffic cones are arranged in diagonal lines on the right side of the road, indicating a lane closure or diversion. These cones guide traffic to avoid potential obstacles or roadwork, requiring the vehicle to adjust its path accordingly. Beyond the traffic cones, there is a metal parking sign at the roadside edge, suggesting potential construction or closed lanes on the right side of the road, requiring caution and potentially a lane change.\n\nLastly, the reflection on the road surface may indicate smooth or slippery conditions. The vehicle should be vigilant for these potential slippery conditions and adjust its speed accordingly."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and pay attention to traffic cones to ensure you are in the correct lane. Due to reduced visibility at night and possibly slippery roads, exercise caution while driving. If your vehicle is in the right lane, you should slow down and prepare to safely merge left to avoid a blocked lane. Use turn signals when changing lanes to indicate your actions to other road users. Since there may be workers or other obstacles near the area where traffic cones are placed, heightened vigilance is required.",
