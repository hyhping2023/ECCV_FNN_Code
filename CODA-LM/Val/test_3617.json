This suggests there might be traffic congestion or an obstruction ahead, requiring our vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A motorcyclist is in the right lane, slightly off the centerline, and traveling in the same direction as the flow of traffic. Due to their smaller size and less protection in traffic, it's crucial to leave enough space to ensure the motorcyclist's safety.\n   - A pedestrian is faintly visible on the right side of the roadside, facing the road, which may indicate their intention to cross or walk along the road. Our vehicle must be prepared to slow down or stop if the pedestrian suddenly steps onto the road.\n\nNo other significant traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The self-driving car should continue to drive at a reduced speed, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, especially from the white car and the motorcyclist, and be prepared to stop at any time in case the traffic ahead comes to a sudden halt. Extra caution is required on slippery roads, and the vehicle's braking and steering inputs should be smooth and controlled to prevent losing control. The self-driving car should also monitor the yellow sedan ahead. Additionally, always stay alert for any movements from pedestrians on the right side and be prepared to yield or stop. Since the status of the traffic lights cannot be determined, approach them with caution and be ready to stop if necessary.",

Considering this pedestrian's presence, the ego car should maintain careful observation and be prepared to adjust speed or position if the pedestrian were to enter the roadway or cross the street. It is crucial for the safety of the pedestrian and the drivers for the ego car to anticipate possible pedestrian movement and react accordingly.",
