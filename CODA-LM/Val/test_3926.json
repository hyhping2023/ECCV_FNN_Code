These vehicles are stationary and do not pose a direct risk but limit the operable space for bypassing obstacles. Additionally, a blue car is parked on the left side of the road, perpendicular to the oncoming traffic lane. This vehicle directly affects the current route of the ego car, necessitating alertness for oncoming traffic during any potential overtaking or turning maneuvers. Also visible are large scrolls and storage materials located behind the fence on the left side of the image. Although these objects are off the road, their presence suggests that this is an industrial or construction area, indicating potential entry or exit of large vehicles or additional traffic nearby."

    "driving_suggestion": "If it is possible to safely circumvent an obstacle, for example, after coordinating with oncoming vehicles, the vehicle should proceed with caution, maintaining low speed and high alertness. If the opposite lane is clear and there are no incoming vehicles, the vehicle can consider carefully entering the opposite lane to bypass the obstacle, ensuring safety. While staying in the current lane, monitor the oncoming traffic to guard against unforeseen incidents. Be cautious when approaching vehicles parked on the right, looking out for any movement signs or pedestrian activity. Adjust the sun visor or use sunglasses to mitigate the impact of low sunlight, ensuring the road ahead is clearly visible. When passing stationary vehicles on the right, keep to your lane, stay alert for any potential obstacles or vehicles that may enter the road from an industrial area, and be prepared for the possibility of oncoming traffic caused by a blue vehicle on the opposite side. If necessary, adjust speed to safely navigate through the area.",

The vehicle's orientation suggests it may have been involved in an accident or is parked improperly. The ego car must adjust its driving behavior to avoid a collision by reducing speed or stopping if necessary, and it may need to change lanes to navigate around the obstruction if the road conditions and traffic laws permit.",
