A pedestrian in a yellow jacket and helmet is on the right side of the road, seemingly associated with the construction work and potentially could enter the roadway unexpectedly, requiring the ego car to be ready to slow down or stop.\n\nTraffic cones are placed along the right side of the road, directing traffic away from the construction vehicle, suggesting that lane shifts or merges may be necessary for the ego car.\n\nLastly, other objects include a row of parked bicycles to the left of the image, behind the traffic cones.

The operator should also be cautious of potentially opening doors or pedestrians stepping out from between the parked vehicles on the left. Overall, increased vigilance and reduced speed are advisable in this scenario. Maintain a safe following distance behind the red SUV, be prepared to adjust speed depending on its actions. Exercise caution and readiness to stop, considering the parked van and pedestrian activity associated with potential roadworks. Stay alert for any movements of the pedestrian in the yellow jacket and be ready to yield. Observe road markings and signs for further instructions due to the congested road conditions and presence of road work. Lastly, monitor for any cyclists that may enter the roadway from the parked bicycles area."
