This vehicle is not obstructing our direct path of travel, but requires attention for any potential actions that might affect our driving, such as changing lanes or sudden braking.\n\nAdditionally, two pedestrians are observed standing on the shoulder of the road on the right side, in front of a safety railing, with one possibly engaged with a device. These individuals are not directly in the path of the autonomous vehicle and are positioned in front of the safety barrier; nevertheless, their movements need to be carefully monitored in case they decide to cross the road.\n\nThere is also a traffic information sign on the right side of the road, which, while it provides information, does not call for an immediate response from the self-driving car.\n\nSafety measures are evident with the installation of safety railings on the right side of the road, which are meant to prevent pedestrians from accidentally stepping onto the roadway and reducing the risk to the vehicle. Additionally, there seems to be an obstruction on the sidewalk indicated by mesh fencing and sandbags beside the pedestrians, suggesting a construction or work area. This could potentially alter pedestrian flow but does not interfere with the vehicle's present trajectory.\n\nThe JSON data indicates that there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects of note in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain the current lane and speed, while paying attention to any changes in the behavior of the white SUV ahead. Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front to be prepared for any sudden stops or changes in speed. Even if pedestrians are behind safety barriers, be vigilant and ready to react in case they move into the lane. Our vehicle should continue to monitor the vehicle ahead, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for any potential changes in behavior. Due to pedestrians being close to the lane, our vehicle should be ready to respond to any signs of them possibly entering the lane. The presence of obstacles along the road suggests that there might be ongoing construction or detours ahead, so our vehicle needs to stay alert and look out for any new road signs or changes in traffic patterns. Since there are no direct obstacles on the road, our vehicle can proceed with caution, adhering to road rules and speed limits. Drive carefully, maintaining a safe speed and distance from the white vehicle ahead. Stay alert to any sudden movements by pedestrians and be prepared to slow down if necessary. Continue to observe the obstacles and adhere to any changes in road conditions or directions indicated by road signs or any additional traffic control signals that may appear.",
