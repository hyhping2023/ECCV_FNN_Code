    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the car ahead, monitor their behavior, and be prepared to slow down in case they do. Additionally, you should pay attention to overhead road signs for navigation tips and lane positioning, and be ready to respond appropriately to signals when approaching traffic lights cautiously. Due to the presence of obstacles, it is advised to stay within your lane. Considering the deceleration of vehicles ahead, overhead diversion signs, and concrete barriers, you should be prepared to slow down or even stop and follow the indicated diversion route if necessary. Keep an eye on road conditions and traffic patterns to respond to any unexpected changes. Carefully follow lane markings and do not attempt to overtake using the opposite lane.",
