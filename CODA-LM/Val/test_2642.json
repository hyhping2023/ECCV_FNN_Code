If unable to change lanes, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the truck and be prepared to stop if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance behind the construction vehicle and be prepared to reduce speed or stop. Monitor the construction signs and the white sedan for potential lane changes. Be prepared to merge left if necessary, due to the indicated lane closure ahead. Proceed with caution through the construction zone, adhering to any posted speed limits or directions from construction personnel. Remain vigilant for any unexpected movement from the vehicles in the surrounding lanes."
