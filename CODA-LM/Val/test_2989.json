This sign indicates upcoming road work and necessitates a reduction in speed, requiring the ego car to exercise caution due to potential hazards or workers on the road ahead.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, there is a series of orange traffic cones forming a line that leads towards a lane merger or road works, directing traffic to the left. These cones require the ego car to change lanes and merge left, necessitating attention and action to navigate safely.\n\nAdditionally, there are white metal barriers on both sides of the road, defining a path that the ego car must adhere to. These barriers restrict lane changes and ensure that road users stay within the safe path, away from construction or potential hazards.\n\nLastly, a series of electrical pylons parallel to the road on the right side do not directly affect immediate driving behavior. However, it is crucial for the ego car to be aware of potential maintenance activities around these structures that could impact traffic."
