This truck is a critical object to monitor as it is occupying part of the lane and could potentially merge into our lane or make sudden movements. Its size can obscure the driver's view of that side of the road and it may make unpredictable movements, especially if it's performing road work or utility tasks. The truck could execute a variety of maneuvers such as slowing down, stopping, or even encroaching into our lane, which necessitates close monitoring by our vehicle.\n\nIn the distance, a green traffic light is visible, indicating that our vehicle has the right of way to continue.

This type of vehicle is equipped with a crane and is used for lifting heavy materials or equipment at construction sites. The presence of such a vehicle on or adjacent to the road indicates construction activity in the vicinity, which may require the ego car to exercise caution, reduce speed, and be prepared for potential road blockages, construction workers, or detours. The ego car driver should stay vigilant for any temporary traffic signals, construction signage, or instructions from workers.",

Continue driving with caution while the traffic light is green, but stay alert for any changes in the traffic light as the intersection is approached. Monitoring for other road users, especially vulnerable ones, is also important even though they are not visible in the current image. Maintain a safe distance from the large yellow vehicle ahead to ensure there's enough reaction time if it makes unexpected maneuvers. Regularly monitor the traffic light ahead for any changes, and be prepared to stop if it turns yellow. Stay attentive to the road conditions and any potential activity from the large vehicle, such as turning or stopping, which might require the ego car to reduce speed or change lanes if it's safe to do so. Maintain a safe following distance from the utility truck ahead and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the truck makes any sudden moves or stops. The ego car should also monitor the traffic light to ensure it remains green while approaching the intersection. At night, visibility is decreased so headlights should be on and high alertness is required. Furthermore, since it's a dynamic scenario, constant environment evaluation is essential for safe driving."
