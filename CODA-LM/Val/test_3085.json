The truck's bright brake lights are visible, but due to the low light conditions, it is difficult to discern the truck's exact positioning. This situation is critical as the truck's position blocks both lanes of the road, presenting a potential hazard. The ego car must pay immediate attention to this obstacle and make a safe decision on how to navigate around or wait for the truck to move. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."

The back of the truck is visible, indicated by the set of red taillights that are often used to signal the vehicle's presence to other drivers in low visibility conditions. Future driving behavior for the ego car should involve maintaining a safe distance from this truck to ensure enough reaction time for any potential stops or turns the truck may make. Additionally, the ego car's driver should be ready to adjust speed accordingly and be vigilant for any changes in the truck's brake lights, which would indicate slowing or stopping.",

It should also turn on high beams, if they are not already activated, to improve visibility and better assess the situation ahead. If the truck is stopped and there's no way to bypass it safely on the road, the ego car should come to a complete stop at a safe distance and wait until the path is clear or seek an alternative route if possible. Use hazard lights to alert any following vehicles to the potential danger. Reduce speed and prepare to stop, activate hazard lights to alert any following vehicles. Assess the situation carefully, looking for signals from the truck driver or any road workers indicating how to proceed. If it looks like an accident, maintain a safe distance and wait for the road to clear or for instructions from emergency services."
