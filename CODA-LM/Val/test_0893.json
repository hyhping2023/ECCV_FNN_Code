This means that from a traffic control perspective, the way forward is clear, and vehicles can continue moving forward as long as it is safe.\n\nFurthermore, there is a line of traffic cones starting from the foreground and extending to the middle ground on the right side of the road. These cones separate the active lane of traffic from a restricted area, likely indicating roadwork or a closed lane ahead. As a result, it is important for the ego car to stay within the lane markings and remain alert for any potential obstructions or changes in traffic patterns.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Drive cautiously on the wet road surface and adjust speed to maintain control and stopping performance. Continue to monitor the traffic light which is currently green to ensure it is obeyed attentively if it changes."
