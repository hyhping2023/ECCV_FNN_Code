However, there are overhead directional traffic signs, concrete barriers, and a large object near the road that are noteworthy. \n\nThe traffic signs observed include overhead directional signs that provide names of roads and directions for lanes. Specifically, one sign points left for G104/Guangyang Rd, and another points right for G104/Huairou Rd. These signs are crucial as they offer directional information for the ego car, indicating which lane to use for upcoming road bifurcations.\n\nAdditionally, concrete barriers are present on the right side of the road, slightly encroaching into the ego car's lane. This situation necessitates that the ego car should stay towards the left side of its lane to maintain a safe distance from these barriers, ensuring safety.\n\nMoreover, a blue, large dumpster-like container is positioned very close to the lane on the right side of the road. The proximity of this container to the travel lane could pose a hazard, requiring the ego car to exercise caution. It may need to change lanes if necessary to maintain a safe distance from the container, avoiding potential risks.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or traffic cones observed in this image."
