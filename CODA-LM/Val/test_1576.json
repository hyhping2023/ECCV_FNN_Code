        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a red forklift on the right-hand side of the road, which appears to be either stationary or moving very slowly due to nearby construction or unloading activities. This forklift is partially blocking the rightmost lane with its back facing the viewer. The presence of the forklift may affect the lane availability and traffic flow, necessitating that the ego vehicle either change lanes or reduce speed to safely navigate around the obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, a worker wearing a high-visibility vest is standing in front of the forklift, on the right side of the road, and is facing the ego vehicle. This could indicate that the worker is monitoring traffic or considering crossing the road. The worker's proximity to the road could lead to potential obstructions, requiring the ego vehicle to drive cautiously and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nDirectly ahead, the ego vehicle is faced with a traffic light that is currently red. This requires the ego vehicle to come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green before continuing.\n\nAlongside the forklift, there are temporary blue and green barriers indicating ongoing construction or roadwork. These barriers may be directing traffic flow or signaling a reduction in road width, which means the ego vehicle will need to maneuver carefully through the area.\n\nLastly, the image includes construction or roadwork signs situated between the barriers and the forklift on the right. These signs suggest there may be changes in traffic patterns or unexpected obstructions ahead, further emphasizing the need for attentive driving in this area."
