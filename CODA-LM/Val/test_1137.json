        "description and explanation": "The image presents a variety of road users and objects that influence driving behavior and decisions. Notably, there are parked cars along the side of the road, with a white sedan positioned closest to the ego car's lane. These vehicles create a narrower driving lane and potentially hide pedestrians or sudden obstacles, emphasizing the need for cautious driving. The presence of these parked vehicles also signifies a risk of unexpected movements, such as car doors opening or a vehicle pulling out, making it necessary for the ego car to adjust its path to ensure a safe distance is maintained.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a traffic sign, specifically a blue rectangular one illuminated by a street lamp, situated above the parked cars on the right. Although the exact information on the sign remains unclear from the current perspective, it implies the anticipation of upcoming road rules that the sign may denote, underlining the importance of staying alert to adhere to these regulations once they become distinguishable.\n\nAnother element in the scenario is some visible debris or refuse on the road near the curb on the right, outside of the direct driving path. This debris introduces a potential hazard for the ego vehicle, necessitating careful navigation or avoidance strategies. While the debris does not immediately affect the vehicle's trajectory, it prompts vigilance for any changes, such as movement of the debris or an indication of pedestrian or animal activity that could lead to them entering the roadway.\n\nIn summary, the image contains crucial details about the driving environment, including parked vehicles that limit lane width, an unclear traffic sign predicting possible road regulations, and road debris implying the need for cautious maneuvering. These factors collectively contribute to the complexity of navigating this particular road segment safely."

It should also keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the right and be prepared to stop or navigate around any sudden obstacles that may appear from the blind spots created by the parked vehicles. Due to the poor lighting conditions and presence of debris near the parked vehicles, the ego car should maintain a reduced speed and heightened alertness while ensuring sufficient clearance from parked cars. The headlights should be used to increase visibility. Avoid lane changes unless it's necessary to bypass an obstacle safely. Proceed with caution, maintaining a low speed to account for the poor visibility and the potential hazards of parked cars and debris. Increase following distances and be prepared for evasive maneuvers should there be unexpected obstacles or road users."
