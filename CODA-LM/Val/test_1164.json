A white car is on the right, moving in the same direction as our vehicle, which necessitates cautious driving as the car might decelerate, halt, or alter lanes. Additionally, a blue truck is parked on the right side, facing the same way our vehicle is traveling, which could potentially disrupt traffic flow by blocking the lane or causing other vehicles to navigate around it. Careful driving is advised to safely proceed. Moreover, some objects resembling debris or small trash are scattered on the road to the right, ahead of our vehicle. These pose a minimal risk, yet they call for the autonomous vehicle to be ready to maneuver safely to avoid them. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white vehicle on the right, monitor its speed or any changes in its lane, and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes at any time. Additionally, approach the blue truck parked on the roadside with caution. If the truck obstructs the road or if other vehicles around it are moving erratically, be prepared to change lanes at any time. Your vehicle should also pay attention to road signs in preparation for any navigation decisions. Be prepared to slow down or stop for pedestrians crossing the street, and stay alert for any potential hazards that may emerge from behind the blue truck on the right. Since the road conditions appear to be good, there is no need to adjust your driving style, but you should still remain vigilant about the dynamic road conditions.",
