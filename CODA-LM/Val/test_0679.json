        "description and explanation": "In the scene before me, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road ahead, which could potentially obstruct the driving path and reduce visibility of pedestrians or other hazards. Several cars are also present further ahead, moving parallel to the ego vehicle's direction of travel. These vehicles may affect the overall flow of traffic and could perform unexpected maneuvers. A pedestrian is observed walking along the sidewalk on the right, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Due to their proximity to the road, it is necessary to monitor their movements for any sudden steps onto the road.\n\nParking signs on the right side indicate a designated parking zone, forewarning the presence of parked vehicles. Additionally, yellow and black traffic cones are placed on the right, signaling a no parking or restricted access region, which narrows the usable roadway for the ego vehicle. Alongside these, there are barriers or bollards marking the separation between the driving lane and sidewalk. Notably, one barrier appears to be slightly tilted, suggesting potential road hazards or neglect of traffic rules, thus caution is recommended while navigating the area.\n\nFurther descriptions include an electrical pole positioned on the right side of the road adjacent to the parked car, which, although not directly hazardous, accentuates the need for cautious driving to accommodate nearby obstacles and the presence of pedestrians. There is also a parked white motorcycle on the far right sidewalk that does not impinge upon the road, thus not affecting the driving path or behavior of the ego vehicle. Traffic lights have not been observed in this depiction. "
