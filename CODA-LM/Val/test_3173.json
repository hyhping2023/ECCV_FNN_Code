Due to its size and potential cargo, the truck might pose a hazard if it's changing lanes or if debris falls from the cargo area. The ego car must monitor this vehicle's trajectory to avoid any potential collisions or obstacles that may arise from its movements."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, there is a significant road user to consider: a large vehicle, which is probably a truck. It features a green tarp covering the cargo area and is located very close to the ego vehicle on its right side. This particular positioning of the truck is crucial as it could create a blind spot for the ego vehicle, making it necessary for extra caution when contemplating lane changes or turning maneuvers. The truck's substantial size and the presence of cargo heighten the risk; thus, precautions are required since there might be a danger of changing lanes or falling debris that could pose threats on the road. The ego vehicle must keep a steady watch on the truck’s trajectory to anticipate and evade any possible collisions or obstacles that might emerge due to the truck’s actions. Other categories including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this image and therefore not a concern in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck and be cautious of potential blind spots. If considering a lane change, ensure that it is done with ample space and after verifying that the adjacent lanes are clear. No other road users or signs are visible, so continue to observe the road ahead for any changes in the traffic environment. Prepare for possible evasive maneuvers if the truck changes lanes abruptly or if any debris falls from the cargo area. Depending on the ego vehicle's speed and the relative speed of the truck, consider changing lanes if it is safe to do so, to avoid any risks associated with the large vehicle. Monitor the truck's indicators for any signs of such intentions and adjust speed and positioning accordingly to maintain safety."
