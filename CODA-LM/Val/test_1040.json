The size and slower speed of the concrete mixer could disrupt the flow of traffic, necessitating the ego car to either decelerate or switch lanes to pass. Additionally, a white van is spotted ahead in the left lane, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The proximity of the van and its potential lane changes need to be carefully monitored to prevent any collision risks.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a group of pedestrians, with some standing close to the curb. The possibility of these pedestrians stepping onto the road requires the ego car to proceed with caution. Regarding traffic signs, there is a no-entry sign for vehicles on the right side of the road, attached to a building façade, which may require the ego car to reroute if that direction was initially intended. There is also a 'No Parking' sign on the building to the right, which does not directly influence the immediate driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nMetal barriers are present along the sidewalk, creating a clear separation between the road and the pedestrian area. These barriers help ensure that the ego car keeps a safe distance from the sidewalk, minimizing the risk of infringing on pedestrian space.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any traffic lights, traffic cones, or other significant objects that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car. The absence of such objects indicates that no immediate adjustments are necessary in response to them."

Additionally, the driver or the autonomous system should remain alert for any upcoming traffic signs or signals that may come into view. The ego car should not consider parking in this area due to the 'No Parking' sign and must also stay clear of the metal barriers on the right."
