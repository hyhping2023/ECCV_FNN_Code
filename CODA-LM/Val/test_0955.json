The substantial size and the positioning of the truck limit the maneuvering space for the ego car, introducing the possibility of abrupt braking or speed adjustments that could impact its trailing distance and velocity.\n- There is also a green bus that is parked on the right side of the road, situated ahead of the ego car. Given that the bus is stationary, it could unexpectedly begin to move or discharge passengers, creating a potential hazard that the ego car must account for.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A cyclist is present on the left side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. To ensure safety, the ego car is required to keep an adequate distance and may need to switch lanes to safely overtake the cyclist.\n- A pedestrian is noticed walking beside the street beyond red barriers on the left, moving in the same direction as the traffic. While this pedestrian isn't an immediate threat to the ego car's path, they should be kept under observation.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- There is a sequence of orange and white traffic cones lined up to delineate a construction site on the right side of the roadway. The cones signal renovation works or similar activities, suggesting that the ego car may need to stay alert and consider merging into the left lane to navigate safely past the work zone.\n\nBarriers:\n- Accompanying the cones, there are green barriers positioned on the right side of the road, enclosing a construction area and stretching alongside it. These indicate ongoing roadwork or a blockage that may require the ego car to decelerate or shift lanes to bypass this section.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects identified in the image that affect the driving behavior, thus they do not require consideration by the ego car."
