Its presence in the same lane as the ego car effectively blocks forward progress and necessitates a change in the ego car's driving behavior. The size and position of this truck may require the ego car to maintain a safe distance and prepare for potential sudden stops or debris falling from the mixer."

The truck is equipped with a large mixing drum and several chutes, indicating its purpose for mixing concrete. This truck's size and position are critical as they limit the ego car's visibility and maneuverability, necessitating a safe following distance and alertness for potential stops or falling debris from the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible above the road to the left of the concrete mixer truck, which is currently green. This green light signals that the ego car has the right of way to proceed. However, despite the green light, the ego car must remain cautious and consider the concrete mixer truck's movements before advancing."

Prepare to change lanes if it is safe to do so. The green traffic light indicates the right of way, but with the obstruction, proceeding forward is not possible without changing lanes. The ego car should use the appropriate turn signals, check mirrors and blind spots for any vehicles in the adjacent lane, and smoothly merge into the open lane when it is safe and clear to proceed, while being mindful of any posted speed limits or construction warnings. If passing is necessary and legal, it should be done with great care and only when a clear lane is available to do so safely."
