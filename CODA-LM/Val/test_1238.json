The presence of this vehicle is important as it may slow down or stop to unload, which would require the ego car to reduce speed or prepare to overtake when it is safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is observed on the right side of the road, walking in the same direction as the ego car. The individual is maintaining a distance from the moving traffic, staying close to the storefronts. The ego car must be vigilant as the pedestrian could potentially move towards the road, necessitating the car to slow down to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, there are piles of debris on the right-hand side of the road, including bags of trash and other miscellaneous items that are encroaching upon the roadway. These objects are a hazard as they reduce the available road space, increase the risk of encountering obstructions in the lane, and may cause road users to make sudden movements to avoid them.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers to consider."
