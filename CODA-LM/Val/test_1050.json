        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, numerous road users can impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle.\n\nFirstly, in the \"vehicles\" category, there is a black car in the left lane traveling in the opposite direction. Even though it's at a distance, its position and movement are closely monitored to preempt any abrupt changes that could influence the driving path.\n\nIn the \"vulnerable road users\" category, there is a person directly ahead in the rightmost lane on our side of the road, pushing a large cart filled with cardboard. This individual and their handcart pose a potential hazard due to their slower and less predictable movements, requiring extra vigilance and preparedness to stop.\n\nIn terms of \"traffic signs,\" there is a parking sign on the right side of the road with a blue background and a white letter \"P,\" indicating a nearby parking area. This sign is crucial for self-driving cars seeking a parking space.\n\nIn the \"barriers\" category, yellow traffic barriers are present on the outermost right lane, narrowing the lane's available width. These barriers suggest the possibility of road construction ahead or closed lanes, necessitating lane position adjustments.\n\nLastly, under \"other objects,\" a tricycle loaded with cardboard has entered the lane from the left, with the person on it not being very visible. This handcart is particularly unpredictable as it may not maintain a consistent speed or follow traffic regulations like normal vehicles, posing a significant risk. \n\nNo additional elements are noted in the categories of traffic lights and traffic cones in this particular traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the sedan ahead, ready to decelerate at any moment. It's important to pay attention to the tricycle on the left and be prepared to slow down or change lanes to the left to avoid it, provided that lane merging is safe. The lead vehicle should not assume that the handcart operator is aware of the surrounding traffic, hence caution is crucial. Additionally, pay attention to the lane information on the blue overpass signs, monitor the black car in the distance, and stay alert for obstacles that may indicate a lane closure, which is vital for long-term navigation decisions. Reduce speed and prepare to change lanes to the left to avoid pedestrians on tricycles who are more vulnerable. At the same time, keep a safe distance from the tricycle and monitor vehicles further ahead.",
