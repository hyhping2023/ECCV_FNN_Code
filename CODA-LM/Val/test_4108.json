A blue and white city bus is traveling in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, and in the same direction. The bus may stop to pick up or drop off passengers, so the ego car needs to be ready to slow down or change lanes.\n2. A sedan is located in the right lane, ahead and to the right of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car should be prepared for any sudden stops or lane changes from the sedan.\n3. A scooter is overtaking a group of orange traffic cones on the right side of the road. The scooter might merge into the ego vehicle's lane, requiring the ego car to be vigilant and possibly adjust its speed or lane position.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A cyclist is riding in the bicycle lane to the right of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car must keep a safe distance and be aware of any potential erratic movements or stops from the cyclist.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. Overhead directional signs indicate the proper lanes for continuing straight or turning. These signs help the ego car to select the correct lane for its intended path.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. The traffic lights are not clearly visible in the image. The ego car must approach intersections with extra caution, ready to stop or yield as necessary.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n1. Traffic cones are placed on the roadside ahead, marking a work zone or road obstruction. The ego car should stay in its lane and be on the lookout for workers or obstructions.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. A small yellow object, which looks like a dog, is in the middle of the road ahead. This could lead to sudden braking or swerving by vehicles ahead, so the ego car needs to stay alert and be prepared to react.\n2. Trees and cars parked on the street are along both sides of the road. Parked cars could block the view or unexpectedly enter traffic, so the ego car should watch for any signs of activity around these vehicles."
