In addition, the vehicle should be prepared to slightly turn to the left to avoid debris on the road, while ensuring that it does not enter the opposite lane and stays in its own lane. Be ready to respond to changes in road conditions, such as unexpected obstacles or debris. Since there are no visible traffic controls or signs, drive cautiously and comply with standard right-of-way rules and speed limits. Continuously observe the behavior of motorcycles and parked cars to detect any signs of movement, and be prepared to make a safe response.",

It appears to be a collection of items such as paper or plastic, which may have fallen from a vehicle or been discarded improperly. While typically not an immediate hazard, garbage on the road can pose a risk if it distracts drivers or if it were to get caught in a vehicle's undercarriage. In this case, the garbage is off to the side and is unlikely to directly impact the driving behavior of the ego car; however, it does indicate a need for street cleaning and maintenance.",
