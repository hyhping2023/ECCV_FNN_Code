Once the traffic light turns green and the pedestrian has cleared the crossing, the ego car can proceed with caution, especially paying attention to the delineated area marked by traffic cones. Additionally, since the right lane seems to be partially closed off, the ego vehicle should prepare to continue in the lane it is currently in, or if needed, safely merge left while respecting any signage or road markings not visible in the image."
