As a vulnerable road user without the protective structure of a vehicle, the cyclist must be given extra consideration by the driver of the ego car. The ego car should reduce speed and ensure there is a safe distance when overtaking the cyclist, following local traffic regulations which may specify a minimum passing distance. Additionally, the driver should monitor the cyclist's movements as they can be less predictable and may need to maneuver around obstacles. The ego car should be prepared to adjust its path or stop if necessary to ensure the safety of the cyclist.",

Use of headlights and, if present, fog lights would improve visibility. Avoid any sudden movements that could startle other road users or reduce vehicle stability. Proceed with caution and continue monitoring the environment for additional road users or signs that may not be immediately visible due to the nighttime conditions."
