The vehicle must be ready to stop suddenly if the pedestrian steps onto the roadway.\n\nTraffic cones are placed ahead, signaling lane merging or road construction. The vehicle should slow down and prepare to merge left or follow the reassigned traffic pattern as necessary.\n\nObstacles or partition walls are set up on the right side of the road. These barriers delineate the lane and restrict vehicles to driving on the left, indicating lane adherence as well as possible detours or restrictions ahead."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the identified road users and objects, one's own vehicle should reduce speed due to potential merging or construction zones indicated by traffic cones, and maintain vigilance due to pedestrians near the road. Vehicles should also keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, be prepared for the possibility of pedestrians suddenly entering the roadway, and follow the traffic pattern changes caused by construction and traffic cones. Careful driving is necessary to ensure pedestrian safety and to adapt to diminished traction on wet road surfaces. It is advisable to use low-beam headlights to increase visibility and avoid dazzling oncoming traffic or pedestrians.",
