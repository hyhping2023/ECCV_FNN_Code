The visibility of headlights from an oncoming car in the distance suggests that the road is a two-way street. The presence of these parked vehicles narrows the available space for driving, and the oncoming traffic could potentially cause glare, affecting visibility for the ego vehicle. Additionally, the scene includes streetlights that provide illumination and several benches on the sidewalk. While these objects are not on the road itself, they indicate that the area is likely to be frequented by pedestrians, and therefore, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution to account for potential pedestrian activity. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and pay attention to observe whether any parked bicycles are moving or pedestrians are appearing. Watch for oncoming vehicles and be prepared to slow down or adjust your lane position as necessary to maintain a safe distance. Due to the lack of road markings, drivers should focus on driving and ensure the vehicle stays within the correct road boundaries. If an oncoming vehicle has its high beams on, promptly dim yours to avoid glare. Maintain a safe distance from vehicles parked on the right side, and adjust your lateral position to the left when necessary. Stay alert for any sudden movements around bicycles or pedestrians who may be difficult to see due to poor lighting. Drive at a cautious speed so that you can stop safely in case of unexpected obstacles. Continue to drive at a low speed with caution due to poor nighttime visibility and the potential movement of pedestrians or parked cars ahead. Be prepared to stop or maneuver if the situation changes.",

For the ego car, this may necessitate a slight adjustment to the driving path to maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicle while passing by. It is vital to observe any potential movements of the parked car, such as brake lights or turn signals that may indicate it is about to enter the traffic flow, requiring the ego car to slow down or stop to give way.",
