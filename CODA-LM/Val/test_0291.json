The presence of the motorcycle is significant as its speed and trajectory could influence the timing of when an autonomous vehicle decides to proceed through the intersection.\n\nAdditionally, there are directional signs on the road that provide important information about the lane layout and the destinations each lane leads to. This information is essential for self-driving cars to plan their routes accurately.\n\nThe traffic lights situated above the intersection show a red signal for the lane going straight and a green signal for the left-turn lane. This indicates that vehicles are permitted to turn left or right but cannot continue straight through the intersection at this time.\n\nReflective traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the intersection, suggesting that there may be a lane blockage or road construction ahead. These cones serve to guide the autonomous vehicle to remain in the correct lane and may signal a need for reduced speed and increased caution due to a potential narrowing of the lane.\n\nLastly, there is a blue and white striped barrier at the corner on the right side of the crossroads, marking the boundaries of pedestrian areas or construction zones. These barriers help to prevent self-driving cars from entering areas they should avoid and work in conjunction with the traffic cones to provide clear guidance on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should continue to go straight under the green light signal. Attention should be paid to the motorcycle ahead, but it does not pose a direct danger. Due to the wet and slippery road surface, our vehicle should reduce speed and be prepared to deal with potential road construction ahead or lanes that may become narrower due to traffic cones. Since the traffic light for going straight is red, our vehicle should stop and wait, and should remain within the lanes marked by traffic cones and obstacles.",
