Also, a police car is parked further up the road, partially in our lane, so we have to be careful to either slow down or move slightly to the left when passing it. Further down the road, still on the right and facing away, there's a mixing truck which indicates possible construction activity ahead, so we should be alert for vehicles entering or exiting the site.\n\nOn the pedestrian front, there's someone in a pink top walking on the roadside towards us, which means we need to keep an eye out in case they step onto the road. Additionally, two traffic officers are ahead near the parked police car, possibly directing traffic or responding to an incident, so we should be ready to follow any instructions they might give.\n\nThere's a speed limit sign indicating 40 km/h posted on the right, which is the speed we must maintain. Surrounding the parked police car, traffic cones have been placed to guide us safely around the partially blocked lane. A blue barrier also sets the boundary for what looks like a construction zone near the police car and associated workers, signaling that extra caution and attentiveness to potential temporary traffic directions are required. Lastly, there is some construction debris near the blue barriers which doesn't currently block the lane, but it warrants additional caution in case there is material on the roadway that could be hazardous."
