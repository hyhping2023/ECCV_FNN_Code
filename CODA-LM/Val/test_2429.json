The parked truck reduces the usable width of the lane and may pose a hazard if it unexpectedly enters traffic. As a result, the ego vehicle must be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Additionally, there are red-colored traffic cones positioned behind the parked truck on the right shoulder. These cones serve as a warning signal for other road users, indicating a closed-off area that may require vehicles, including the ego car, to merge left or slow down to navigate safely around the potential hazard. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone, typically used to mark areas within a roadway that are to be avoided for safety reasons. It is often orange with white horizontal striping and made of a pliable material. In driving scenarios, cones are deployed to indicate construction zones, lane merges, or other temporary changes in traffic patterns. They serve as visible cues to drivers to proceed with caution and potentially to navigate away from their current path to ensure roadway safety.",

Caution should be taken when approaching the traffic cone, slowing down to assess the lane's status and to ensure that no workers or unexpected obstacles are present within the vicinity of the parked vehicle and traffic cone. It is important for the ego car to remain alert and to follow any road work signs or indications that might be present but are not visible in the provided image. Maintain a cautious speed due to the potentially wet road conditions. Pass the parked truck and traffic cone with increased vigilance, watching for any unpredictable movements or road users that may enter the roadway. No immediate action is required as there are no imminent hazards obstructing the vehicle's path, but preparedness to react to changing conditions is advised."
