These vehicles, including cars and possibly larger vehicles like vans or trucks, are positioned parallel to the road and are stationary with their headlights and taillights off, indicating non-involvement in the current traffic flow. The presence of these vehicles reduces the available road space, heightening the risk of potential collisions due to inadequate lateral clearance for the ego vehicle. Additionally, these vehicles may obstruct the view of pedestrians or other obstacles, necessitating cautious driving and possibly a slight shift to the left within the lane while navigating past these vehicles.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, the specific signs are not clearly identifiable due to the low visibility in the image. Consequently, without clear visibility of the traffic signs, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, adhering to the general road rules applicable to the area.\n\nAlthough the image does not show any traffic lights, the ego vehicle must depend on other visual cues and adhere to traffic regulations such as right-of-way and speed limits to guide its behavior during transit.\n\nLastly, the image depicts a significant glare from the headlights of the ego vehicle, which may reduce visibility and obscure potential hazards. This glare could suggest misalignment of the headlights or dirt on the camera lens, impacting the ego vehicle's ability to detect and respond to nearby road users or obstacles effectively.\n"

Be prepared for potential maneuvering around the parked vehicles, especially those encroaching into the driving lane. Keep a safe distance from the parked cars to avoid collisions, and continuously scan the road for any unexpected obstacles or road users that may be difficult to see in the dark. The ego vehicle should also adjust its lateral position slightly to the left when safe to do so, to avoid passing too closely to the parked cars on the right. Headlights should be properly utilized to ensure maximum visibility, and the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or maneuver if unexpected road users or obstacles emerge from between parked vehicles. Continued monitoring for any discernible traffic signs or changes in the road state as illumination improves is recommended."
