This car appears to be stationary or moving slowly due to construction work ahead. Its presence is important for understanding traffic flow and maintaining a safe distance, affecting the path planning and speed regulation of the ego car.\n\nMultiple traffic signs include yellow and black striped barriers that create no-entry zones, a speed limit sign indicating 30 km/h, and a yellow diamond-shaped sign with an arrow suggesting a merge to the right. These signs signal restricted road regions, the maximum speed the ego car should follow, and a required merge, respectively, necessitating caution and attention to merging traffic.\n\nTraffic cones are demarcating a temporary pathway by arranging large, yellow and black striped cones and barriers, directing traffic to the left and narrowing the lane. This setup suggests a detour or redirection, requiring the ego car to maneuver to the left due to road work or an obstruction.\n\nTemporary yellow and black striped barriers on both sides of the diverted lane indicate restricted vehicle pathways. Additionally, large, striped drums or barrels on the edge near a construction zone serve as boundaries to protect the site. These barriers reinforce the importance of staying within the designated lane, ensuring the ego car does not enter hazardous or restricted areas.\n\nA dustbin is located on the bottom right of the image beside the traffic cones. Although it does not obstruct traffic, it is crucial to note its presence to avoid accidental swerves that may bring the vehicle too close to the roadside."

Maintain a vigilant lookout for any temporary traffic signals or construction workers who may be directing traffic. Keep a safe distance from the white sedan in case it is in motion and observe for any oncoming traffic that might be sharing the opposite side of the road. The ego car should reduce its speed to adhere to the 30 km/h speed limit and prepare to navigate the diversion by moving to the left, following the pathway marked by the traffic cones and barriers. The driver should stay alert for any unexpected movements from the stationary vehicle on the right and be prepared to adjust the driving path as needed. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the construction site on the right for potential exiting vehicles or pedestrians. Overtaking should be avoided due to the reduced lane width and the presence of the stationary or slow-moving white car. Maintaining a heightened awareness of potential unforeseen obstacles and sudden stops within the construction zone is recommended."
