The presence of these vehicles requires careful attention as the ego car approaches to ensure there is enough space to pass safely and to monitor for any movement or activity around the vehicle that may impact the driving scenario."

These vehicles, while stationary, do not immediately threaten the road's safety but demand cautious navigation. The primary concern revolves around the potential for doors to open unexpectedly or pedestrians to emerge around these vehicles. Thus, as the ego car progresses, it is crucial to maintain vigilant observation to ensure ample passing space and to stay alert for any sudden movements or activities that might influence the driving dynamics."

This other vehicle's presence indicates that there is oncoming traffic, and if the road is undivided, it necessitates that the ego car must remain on the correct side of the road to avoid potential collisions. Additionally, the brightness of the headlights may impact visibility for the driver of the ego car, requiring adaptation such as averting gaze slightly to avoid being dazzled.",

The presence of this car is crucial for the ego vehicle's future driving behavior, as it must navigate carefully to avoid any collision with this stationary vehicle. The ego vehicle may need to steer slightly towards the center of the road if space permits and it is safe to do so, maintaining a safe distance from the parked car. The ego vehicle's driver should also be aware of any possible occupants in or around the parked vehicle that could open doors or step into the roadway.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution due to limited visibility and the presence of parked vehicles on the side of the road. Reduce speed to ensure there is ample time to react to any potential hazards that may arise from the parked vehicles or poor lighting conditions. Use appropriate lighting to enhance visibility and remain aware of the potential for pedestrians or other obstacles that may not be visible at this distance or lighting condition. Due to low visibility and the presence of a vehicle on the side of the road, the ego car should ensure its headlights and, if necessary, fog lights are on to improve visibility. It should reduce speed and increase following distance to prepare for unexpected obstacles or movements by the parked vehicle. The ego car should also be ready to stop or maneuver carefully if needed. It's crucial to be attentive to any additional hazards that may become visible as the vehicle progresses."
