Firstly, there's a cyclist on the right side of the road going in the same direction as our vehicle. The autonomous vehicle must keep a safe distance from the cyclist and be ready to alter its course for safe overtaking. Secondly, there's a motorcycle under a distant bridge on the right, moving away from our vehicle. The autonomous system should monitor the motorcycle's trajectory to prevent any collision in case of sudden maneuvers.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs or lights, there are water-filled barriers positioned at the edge of the road. These barriers suggest possible road work or obstructions ahead, and as such, the autonomous vehicle should be cautious and ready to navigate around them.\n\nLastly, the scene includes other objects like a blue bicycle leaning against a wall and benches on the sidewalk, all to the right near a building. These objects are off the road but indicate potential pedestrian activity, signaling the vehicle to stay alert to the possibility of pedestrians entering the roadway."

Maintain travel in the right lane, avoiding the restricted area on the left.
