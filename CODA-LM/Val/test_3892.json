        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, we observe various road users and objects:\n\nFirstly, there is a silver sedan parked on the right side of the road ahead, facing the opposite direction of our vehicle's travel. The parked vehicle might obstruct part of the lane or potentially affect the traffic flow when its doors are opened.\n\nTo the left of the road, ahead of our vehicle and near the parked sedan, there are adults who appear to be loading or unloading items onto a tricycle. These pedestrians and their actions could inadvertently encroach on our lane, impacting our navigation.\n\nAbove the road, there is a traffic sign indicating the orientation of lanes for turning left and going straight. This information is crucial for our vehicle to understand the upcoming road layout and make any necessary lane changes in advance to follow the road's intended course.\n\nAdditionally, a temporary green fence is installed on the right side of the road, marking the boundary of a construction or restricted area. This barrier is an indication that the available road width may be reduced, necessitating caution to ensure we do not veer into the restricted zone.\n\nFinally, trash cans are placed on the sidewalk to the right, which are not an immediate threat to the vehicle. However, careful monitoring is advised in case the trash cans are moved, potentially causing obstruction and affecting both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\nThe summary accounts for the provided details about each road user or object which could have implications for the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, ensuring safety and compliance with traffic regulations."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, maintain a steady speed to navigate around the parked sedan, and be prepared to respond to any pedestrians that may enter the road. Pay close attention to pedestrian behavior, and if they start to approach the lane, be ready to slow down and give them space. Continue to monitor the surrounding environment to identify other potential hazards that are not immediately visible, keep your lane position, and slow down to prevent possible car door openings or pedestrians stepping onto the road. Follow the traffic signs, and be prepared to respond to any instructions that may come from the traffic lights ahead (currently not visible). Keep a safe distance from obstacles and watch for any signs of pedestrians intending to enter the road.",
