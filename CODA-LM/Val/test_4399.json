It is large, green, and occupies most of the lane width, which may obscure vision and requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance due to potential sudden stops or turns. To the left of the ego vehicle, there is a white utility vehicle with red and white diagonal stripes and police markings, partially in view. This police vehicle may perform unexpected maneuvers, so caution is advised. Additionally, vehicles in the oncoming traffic lanes are visible, indicating the presence of traffic but not directly affecting the ego car's path. However, their presence should be noted for general road conditions and possible oncoming traffic behaviors.\n\nBeside the ego vehicle, in the left lane, there is a white unmarked van slightly ahead and parallel, which could prevent the ego vehicle from changing lanes to the left. Several cars are also present in the right lane beyond the concrete mixer truck, traveling in the same direction, which will influence the flow of traffic and could impact lane change decisions or speed adjustments.\n\nA \"No left turn\" sign is suspended over the intersection directly in front of the ego vehicle, indicating that a left turn is not permitted at the intersection. Directly above this sign, a red traffic light is visible for vehicles moving straight or turning right, requiring the ego vehicle to come to a complete stop at the intersection.\n\nMetal barriers are located on the right side of the road, delineating the sidewalk from the road, and a part of a pedestrian fence is visible beyond the barriers. These barriers restrict road width on the right and prevent any right-side maneuvering, keeping the vehicle within the lane."
