Additionally, a white SUV is observed on the right, positioned at an angle that suggests it could be merging into the ego car's lane or obstructing it, necessitating that the ego car monitors this SUV closely for a possible adjustment in speed or lane position. Also visible are multiple vehicles in other lanes with illuminated tail lights, indicating slow or congested traffic conditions, meaning the ego car should stay alert for unexpected stops or changes in the flow of traffic. \n\nOn the right side, there is a white van facing perpendicular to the direction of the ego car's travel, which appears to be parked. Even though it does not directly impact the ego car's current movement, vigilance is needed in case the van enters the traffic stream or pedestrians navigate around it. \n\nThere is a green traffic light visible ahead, signifying that the ego car is permitted to proceed through the intersection, yet caution is advised due to the movement of other vehicles and the possibility of the traffic light changing. \n\nSeveral traffic cones are set up to the right within the ego vehicle's lane, indicating a construction zone or obstruction on the road, which might require the ego car to be cautious and ready to adjust its lane position as needed. A barrier is also present on the right side of the scene, which could suggest ongoing roadwork or a closed-off area next to the lane, again underlining the importance of maintaining lane discipline and being prepared for traffic flow changes.\n\nLastly, the traffic scene includes glare from a street lamp and reflections on the wet road surface, introducing challenges such as slippery conditions and potentially impaired visibility, demanding careful driving from the ego car."

Continue through the intersection cautiously, adhering to the green light while staying prepared for quick reactions due to traffic conditions. Pay attention to the traffic cones and barrier, staying in the correct lane and reducing speed if necessary to navigate safely past possible road work or obstructions. Due to the glare and wet road conditions, reduce speed appropriately and increase following distance to improve reaction time in case of sudden stops or turns by other road users."
