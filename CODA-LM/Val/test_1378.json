Its presence necessitates increased following distance and readiness to adjust speed or lane position if the truck changes lanes or encounters any issues."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two notable vehicles. Firstly, a white hatchback car is directly ahead of the ego car, positioned in the center of the lane. This necessitates maintaining a safe following distance by the ego car, with readiness to respond to any sudden actions from the hatchback. Secondly, there's a cement truck in the neighboring right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The truck's large size and potentially heavy load call for a greater following distance and alertness to any potential maneuvers the truck might undertake that could affect the driving situation.\n\nApart from the vehicles, the only other element present is an environmental factor: raindrops on the windshield. This indicates that it's raining, which can compromise visibility and traction on the road. Consequently, the ego car should have its headlights on, windshield wipers active, and exercise additional caution while driving to ensure safety. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers identified in the current image."

It is characterized by its sturdy build and may include parts such as a bucket, shovel, or crane. The presence of such a vehicle on the road often suggests active construction work nearby, and it may influence the driving behavior by necessitating increased attentiveness, reduced speed, and preparedness for sudden stops or detours due to construction activities or the vehicle entering and exiting the construction site.",

The use of headlights and windshield wipers is also advised to improve visibility."
