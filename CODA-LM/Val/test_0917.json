Firstly, a black sedan is moving across the intersection to the left of the ego vehicle, which could potentially collide with the ego vehicle or affect its intended path. Additionally, there is a construction roller on the right side of the road, partially on the roadway and the curb, creating a possible temporary obstruction with an uncertain operational status. Also parked on the right side of the road, closer to the ego vehicle, is a construction excavator, signaling potential construction activity ahead that may impact road conditions and lane availability.\n\nFurthermore, two workers wearing high-visibility orange clothing are standing on the right edge of the road, with one slightly ahead and closer to the road. Their proximity to the driving path poses a risk as they might enter the driving path unexpectedly or indicate changes in traffic patterns due to construction.\n\nLastly, reflections on the road surface suggest that the road may be wet or slick, which necessitates an adjustment in the ego car's speed and following distance to account for reduced tire grip and longer braking distances. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
