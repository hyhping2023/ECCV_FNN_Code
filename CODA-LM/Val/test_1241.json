On the left side, there is a forklift carrying a load, positioned perpendicular to the ego car's direction of travel. A person is standing beside the forklift. This forklift is a potential hazard as it could cross the ego vehicle's path or drop its load, and it is actively loading or unloading goods, which may lead to unpredictable movements. The person standing beside the forklift is also a concern as they may enter the roadway or interact with the forklift in a manner that could affect traffic flow. Their proximity to the vehicle's path increases the risk of a possible accident, as they may step into the path of the ego car.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a line of parked buses, parallel to the ego vehicle's direction of travel. While these buses are not an immediate threat, they could hide pedestrians stepping out from between them or vehicles that may enter the road unexpectedly. The parked buses may also obstruct the view of the road ahead, potentially requiring the ego car to move slightly to the left to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is assorted debris on both sides of the road, with some encroaching on the edges of the drivable path. This debris presents a risk of tire damage or could cause the vehicle to swerve unexpectedly to avoid it.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

As the ego vehicle approaches, the driver should be cautious of its potential movements such as stopping to pick up or drop off passengers or pulling out into traffic.

The driver should be prepared to stop or slow down if the forklift enters the road or the load becomes unstable. Additionally, due to the parked buses on the right and the condition of the road, maintaining a lower speed is advised to react safely to any unforeseen obstacles or individuals that may emerge from the buses' blind spots or due to road irregularities. Decrease speed to allow for more reaction time due to the presence of both the forklift and the worker on the left. Maintain a safe distance from the forklift, and be prepared to stop if necessary. Continuously monitor the parked buses on the right for any signs of activity that may affect the path of the ego car. Drive cautiously due to the poor road conditions, avoiding debris and adjusting speed as needed."
