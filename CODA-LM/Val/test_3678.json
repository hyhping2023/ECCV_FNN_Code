This indicates congested traffic conditions, and it is important for the ego vehicle to drive cautiously and be prepared to stop or slow down. Additionally, there is a white vehicle on the right lane facing the ego vehicle, signaling the need to be vigilant for oncoming traffic when making road decisions, especially if a lane change or turn is being considered.\n\nVulnerable road users are present in the form of pedestrians on the right side of the road, positioned behind a barrier, with some facing towards the ego vehicle. The proximity of these pedestrians to the driving path means that the ego vehicle should keep an eye on them and be ready to yield if they enter the road.\n\nThe traffic image also includes a traffic light in the distance displaying a green light, which allows the ego vehicle to proceed, provided the way is clear. However, the driver should remain alert and ready to stop in case the light changes.\n\nLastly, there is a metal barrier on the right side of the ego vehicle, which serves as a partition between the road and the sidewalk. This barrier indicates that there is limited road space and suggests the possibility of pedestrians moving around the barrier. The ego vehicle should therefore be attentive to any individuals that may emerge from behind the barrier."
