These parked vehicles reduce the available road width, requiring the ego car to navigate carefully to ensure safe passage. Additionally, an excavator is positioned on the left side of the road, next to a pile of debris, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance work. This necessitates the ego vehicle to slow down and be alert for possible obstacles or workers on the road. A motorbike is also present, leaning against a fence on the right side, just beyond the parked trucks. Although it is stationary, it indicates that a rider may be nearby and could enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nA red truck is observed entering the road from a side street, which could potentially intersect with the ego vehicle's path, necessitating careful monitoring of its intentions and trajectory. A no parking sign is visible on the fence to the right, indicating that vehicles should not be parked along this stretch, despite the sign being currently ignored.\n\nTemporary fencing is erected on both sides of the road, restricting access to the surrounding areas and delineating the construction zone from the road. This indicates that drivers should proceed with caution through this area. Debris and construction materials are scattered on the road and beside the excavator on the left, posing a risk of tire damage or requiring the ego car to maneuver around them. Various unsecured items, such as wooden planks and rubble, are on the road's shoulder on the right, which could obstruct the ego car's path or become hazards if displaced. Lastly, miscellaneous debris and materials are scattered on the sides of the road, especially on the left, with no clear organization, indicating poor maintenance or ongoing construction and signaling the ego vehicle to remain vigilant for potential hazards encroaching on the driving lane."

Lastly, the wet road conditions warrant a more cautious speed to account for increased stopping distances. Keep a watchful eye on the red truck for any sudden movement into the road."
