        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are wooden horse barricades on the side of the road forming a temporary obstacle. This suggests a work zone or a closed-off area, likely resulting in reduced available space on the road for driving. Consequently, the vehicle must decelerate or adjust its course away from the obstacle to keep a safe distance, ensuring safe passage around the barricades. There are no other road users, such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a moderate speed, ready to respond to potential changes indicated by the electronic countdown sign. Avoid parked scooters and keep a safe distance from traffic cones and wooden roadblocks. If obstacles encroach into the driving lane, it may be necessary to adjust the lateral position accordingly. Standard cautious driving behavior should suffice since there are no other road users or complex scenarios in view. Considering the possibility that parked motorcycle riders may return to their vehicles, maintain a cautious speed and ensure that delivery scooters remain stationary. Stay alert for pedestrians or cyclists who may be forced into the lane due to obstacles. Simultaneously, continue monitoring further road users and signs providing new contextual information that may require adjustment of driving behavior. Since there are no immediate dangers or signals indicating that the vehicle should take specific actions, it can continue driving at a safe speed according to road conditions. However, be wary of potentially opened car doors or movements of parked motorcycles and keep a safe distance from obstacles.",
