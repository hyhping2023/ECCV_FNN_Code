Firstly, we have a temporary traffic light installed atop a yellow and black striped barrier, which is currently displaying a green light. This setup is crucial as it regulates the flow of traffic, implying there might be construction work or some incident ahead on the road. The green light signals that it is currently safe for the ego car to continue moving forward. Secondly, the presence of the yellow and black striped barrier positioned in the middle of the road signifies a change in the normal traffic pattern, possibly due to roadwork or alterations. This barrier serves as a warning that the ego vehicle may need to adapt by changing lanes or reducing speed to navigate safely through the altered road conditions. These are the key elements in the traffic image that directly influence the driving decisions of the ego car."
