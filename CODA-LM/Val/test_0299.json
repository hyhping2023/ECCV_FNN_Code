        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a dark-colored SUV located directly ahead in the same lane, positioned over the crosswalk. This stationary state of the SUV suggests that it might be yielding to pedestrians or abiding by the traffic signals. As an autonomous vehicle, this scenario requires adjusting the following distance and speed accordingly to ensure safety and compliance with traffic rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign positioned overhead, which indicates the destination of the lanes straight ahead and to the right, using arrows. This sign is critical for the autonomous vehicle as it aids in lane positioning according to the predetermined route. It also provides valuable information about upcoming road conditions, which is essential for making informed lane choices.\n\nFurthermore, the scene includes a continuous barrier extending along the right edge of the autonomous vehicle's lane. This barrier delineates the boundary between the roadway and adjacent green space, serving as a fixed marker. It plays a significant role in guiding the vehicle to remain within its designated lane, emphasizing the need for the vehicle to steer clear of it to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nIn this traffic image, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present that need to be considered by the autonomous driving system. The summarized scene focuses on navigating around the stationary SUV, adhering to directional signs for proper lane positioning, and avoiding roadside barriers to maintain a safe driving path."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a sufficient safe distance while following the SUV in front, always ready to adjust speed to respond to the SUV stopping or changing lanes due to yielding to pedestrians or obeying traffic signals. If the right lane is restricted or closed due to obstacles, be prepared to merge left and pay attention to any changes in traffic signals. Maintain lane discipline and drive according to the marked signs. Due to the malfunctioning traffic lights, drive cautiously, slow down if necessary to safely respond to changes in the road ahead, and watch for any necessary lane change signs.",
