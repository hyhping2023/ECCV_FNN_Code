A large engineering truck loaded with soil or construction materials is driving in the right-hand lane and slightly encroaching on the middle lane. This construction vehicle's encroachment on the middle lane may affect the available driving space for our vehicle, creating a potential risk of a side collision if any vehicle drifts in the opposite direction.\n2. A white car is traveling in the left lane ahead of our vehicle, heading in the same direction. The ego car has determined a safe following distance to maintain, and any sudden stops or speed changes by this white car will directly influence our driving behavior.\n3. A black sedan is parked on the right lane, parallel to our vehicle. This vehicle might start moving, requiring preparedness to adjust speed or change lanes accordingly.\n\nThere is one vulnerable road user observed:\n- A pedestrian wearing an orange jacket is at the edge of the right-hand sidewalk, not actively crossing the street. Pedestrians close to the roadway necessitate caution from drivers in case they suddenly enter the street, requiring the ability to stop or slow down promptly.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects observed in this image."

Be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Watch out for pedestrians on the right; be ready to respond if they step onto the road. Also, monitor the black sedan for any intentions to merge into the lane, and stay alert for debris that may fall from the construction vehicle.",
