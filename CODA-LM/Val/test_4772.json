This car, due to its distance and the lane it occupies, is currently not affecting our vehicle's driving behavior directly. Additionally, there are several pedestrians standing near a structure that looks like a bus station, located on the sidewalk to the left of the autonomous vehicle. While these pedestrians are not in the vehicle's direct path, their vicinity to the road necessitates vigilance to ensure they don't inadvertently enter the roadway, posing a potential hazard. Furthermore, traffic cones have been placed on both sides of the road. This setup indicates the possibility of a hazardous situation ahead or ongoing road construction, signaling that drivers, including the autonomous vehicle, should possibly reduce their speed in anticipation of lane narrowing or encountering obstacles. The categories related to traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects yielded no relevant observations in this instance."
