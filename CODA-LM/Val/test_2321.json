This large vehicle necessitates increased stopping distance and vigilant monitoring for any sudden movements or stops due to its operational nature.\n   - A white sedan is visible in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Attention is required for potential lane changes or maneuvers that could impact the driving path of the ego vehicle.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A pedestrian is visible on the sidewalk on the right, moving parallel to the road but away from the intersection. Although not currently on the road, the pedestrian needs to be monitored in case they decide to cross the street or move unpredictably into traffic.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Overhead directional signs indicate directions to various roads such as Fuxing Rd., Xizang Rd./Middle, and The Bund. These signs provide essential navigation information, suggesting that lane selections for upcoming intersections or turns should be made in advance.\n   - A blue road sign on the right indicates a right turn lane ahead. This suggests that the rightmost lane is designated for turning, so the ego vehicle should remain in the current lane if not intending to turn right.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - There is a traffic light visible, but the current signal color cannot be determined from the image. The ego vehicle should be prepared to change speed or stop based on the upcoming traffic light signal.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n   - Flower bed barriers separate opposing traffic flows, defining the lanes and restricting the possibility of making left-hand turns or U-turns.\n\n6. **Other Objects**:\n   - Another pedestrian is walking along the right sidewalk. While their movement is not currently affecting the roadway, it is essential to monitor them in case they decide to cross the street.\n\nThere are no traffic cones present in the traffic image."

Additionally, monitor the pedestrian for any unexpected entry into the roadway."
