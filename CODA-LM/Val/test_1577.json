The truck is described as a cargo container vehicle adorned with clear container markings and reflective safety stickers. The red tail lights of the truck are visible, hinting that it might be moving slowly or on the verge of initiating movement. The significance of the truck's presence on the road is substantial as it directly influences the driving decisions of the ego car. To ensure safety and compliance with traffic regulations, it is imperative for the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance behind the truck. This precaution is necessary to accommodate any sudden stops or reduced speed the truck might exhibit, ensuring a safe driving environment for all road users involved."

Due to the truck's dimensions and potential slow speed, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for the truck's longer stopping distance. Furthermore, the ego car may need to be aware of the limited visibility around the truck and prepare for a potential overtake when it is safe and legal to do so.",

Be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, especially if the truck makes unexpected maneuvers or stops. Use headlights appropriately to ensure good visibility and consider a lane change if the truck's speed is significantly lower than the speed limit and it is safe to do so. Be aware of the reduced visibility due to it being nighttime and drive accordingly. Use caution when approaching the truck, and do not attempt to overtake unless it is safe to do so and observe for any signals from the truck indicating intent to move or turn."
