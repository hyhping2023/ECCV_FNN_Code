It is a large cargo truck with a covered load and is partly occupying the adjacent lane on its right side. This truck is potentially obstructive, and its size and partial lane occupation suggest that the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance to ensure visibility and to be prepared for any sudden stops or turns the truck might make.\n\nSecondly, there is a concrete mixer truck in the center lane, directly in front of the ego vehicle. This truck is large, with a rotating drum, and is likely traveling slower due to its heavy load. It represents an obstacle that affects the ego vehicle's speed and may necessitate a lane change to overtake.\n\nThirdly, there is a truck with a black cover on the right lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. It appears to be carrying gravel or construction materials, as indicated by the shape of the cover. This truck does not have an immediate impact on the ego vehicle unless there is a need to shift to the right lane.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible ahead that is showing red. The ego car must prepare to stop at the intersection, as the red light indicates that traffic must halt. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

Due to its size and operational nature, this vehicle may move slower than average road traffic and may make wide turns. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the possibility of abrupt stops, slow movement, or the need for the construction vehicle to maneuver in and out of a construction site.",

Monitor the red truck to the left for any sudden lane changes or stops. Because of the wet road conditions, increase the braking distance and reduce speed to avoid hydroplaning. Continue to observe the red traffic light for changes and any additional traffic signs or signals that may appear. Additionally, the driver should be aware of the trucks in the nearby lanes and be ready for any potential lane changes or braking from these vehicles."
