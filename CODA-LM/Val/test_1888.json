On the left, there is a partially visible black jeep-like vehicle with oversized tires, entering the same road as the ego vehicle from a side road or driveway. This vehicle might merge into the lane of the ego vehicle, requiring a potential reduction in speed or a lane change to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, in the distance ahead, there is a white truck traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of this truck necessitates that the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance and prepares for any changes in the truck's speed or direction.\n\nThere is also an overhead gantry traffic sign with warning symbols indicating crosswinds, a falling rocks area, and a slippery road ahead, accompanied by text in Chinese suggesting additional warnings or directions. This sign indicates potential hazards on the upcoming road, suggesting that the ego car should adjust its speed and increase vigilance for unexpected conditions.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on the right side of the road, separating it from a construction or undeveloped area. These barriers establish the drivable road's edge and indicate a lack of a shoulder, which could affect the ego car's ability to maneuver during emergencies."
