        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, although there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists present, there are significant roadworks indicators which impact traffic flow and behavior. Primarily, a series of traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road. They delineate either a work area or a hazardous area, guiding the flow of traffic away from this section and signaling that vehicle access is restricted to that particular area of the road. Additionally, large red plastic barriers are situated on the left side, creating a continuous wall that effectively reduces the lanes available to vehicles. This arrangement suggests the presence of road construction or a lane closure, necessitating vehicles to adjust their lane positions to navigate the area safely. No traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are mentioned in the scene, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the driving conditions at this moment."

The ego car must avoid this barrier by not driving into or over the restricted zone, and it should follow any detour signs or road markings that direct traffic around it.",
