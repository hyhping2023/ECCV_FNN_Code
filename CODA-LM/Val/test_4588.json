This vehicle is only partially in view, with its front end facing the direction of the ego car. The position of the white vehicle indicates that it is currently stationary. Despite not being an immediate obstruction to the lane, caution is advised for the ego car to maintain a safe distance. This caution is necessary as there may be the possibility of car doors being opened into the lane, or the parked vehicle might commence movement unexpectedly. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects present in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
