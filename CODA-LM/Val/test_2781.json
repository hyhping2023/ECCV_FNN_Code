This directly impacts the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, as it must prepare to slow down or halt to maintain a safe following distance from the truck.

In driving scenarios like this, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck, as trucks have larger blind spots and may take longer to stop than smaller vehicles.
