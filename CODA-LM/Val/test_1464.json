        "description and explanation": "In the scene observed, there is a variety of road users and objects. On the right side of the driveway, there's a red forklift that's stationary and partially occupying the road. The presence of the forklift may indicate nearby work or loading activities, which could introduce obstacles into the right lane. Additionally, a worker wearing a high-visibility vest is crossing the road from right to left, directly in front of the observing vehicle. The worker is walking and appears to be holding something in his right hand. Such a vulnerable road user poses a potential risk to the flow of traffic as he is close to moving vehicles and may change direction or stop abruptly, necessitating careful navigation by autonomous driving systems.\n\nIn terms of traffic control, the central traffic light is displaying a green signal, which would generally permit vehicles, including autonomous cars, to proceed, though with attention to other safety considerations in the environment.\n\nThere are also construction fences and obstacles located on the right side of the road, marking construction zones or closed areas. These barriers are likely to affect the usable width of the road on that side, requiring vehicles to navigate cautiously around them.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in the image, indicating their absence from the scene or lack of relevance to the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the proximity of road construction, proceed with caution and monitor pedestrians within the closed area, ready to anticipate them crossing the road. Maintain a safe distance from obstacles and traffic cones, and be prepared at all times to respond to sudden changes that may arise from construction activities (including stationary forklifts). Although the traffic light is green, the vehicle may continue to move forward, but must remain vigilant, ready to respond to the movement of road workers and any unforeseen obstructions.",

Its presence indicates potential construction activity in the area. The ego car should maintain a safe distance, be prepared for unexpected movements, and watch for any signs or signals from construction personnel directing traffic.",
