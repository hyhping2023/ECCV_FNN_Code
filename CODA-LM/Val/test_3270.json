Additionally, there is a person standing next to the forklift, also on the left side, within the roadway and wearing a high-visibility vest. The pedestrian's proximity to the construction equipment suggests there may be ongoing road work, which could lead to unexpected movements into the ego car's path.\n\nAhead of the ego vehicle, there is a traffic light displaying a red signal, which mandates that the ego vehicle must stop at the traffic signal. Construction barriers are also present, marking a work zone on the left side of the road. These barriers indicate that part of the road or an adjacent lane is obstructed or closed for construction, necessitating that the ego car adjust its navigation to maintain a safe distance from the work zone.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

It appears to be operating near a construction site, indicated by the presence of barriers and the urban development in the background. The fact that it's on or near the roadway means that the ego car should exercise increased caution, reduce speed, and possibly change lanes if it's safe and necessary to avoid proximity to the construction work. The presence of such a vehicle suggests potential obstructions or altered traffic patterns ahead, which the driver should be prepared for.",

The pedestrian's proximity to the construction vehicle indicates they may be associated with the construction work, but regardless, their presence is a signal to the driver that they must be prepared for potential human activity on or near the road, which could affect the flow of traffic and impose additional safety considerations.",
