Vehicles:\n   - A number of cars are parked in parallel along the right side of the road, causing a reduction in the width of the drivable area, necessitating adjustments in the path of the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance.\n   - The trunk of a car parked perpendicularly on the right side is open, with its rear facing the road, indicating possible unloading or loading activities. This situation might lead to the vehicle driving onto the road or opening its doors, affecting the route planning of the ego vehicle.\n   - A white car is positioned to the left in the same lane as the ego vehicle, potentially influencing the traffic flow and necessitating speed adjustments.\n\n2. Barriers:\n   - Blue and white traffic barriers are positioned on the left side of the road, delineating prohibited areas for vehicles and helping to guide the traffic flow.\n\n3. Other Objects:\n   - A dog is observed crossing the road from left to right in front of the vehicle. Given the unpredictability of the animalâ€™s movements, the vehicle must proceed with utmost caution to accommodate any sudden changes in direction.\n\nThe traffic image does not show any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones."

Meanwhile, maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and the truck on the right side to prevent potential conflicts. Additionally, due to the slippery road conditions possibly affecting braking and handling, drive cautiously. Monitor whether the white car on the left shows any signs of movement.
