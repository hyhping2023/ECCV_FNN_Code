The presence of this truck necessitates the maintenance of a safe following distance by the ego vehicle. This precaution is essential to ensure there is adequate braking time available, and to account for any potential reductions in speed or unexpected stops the truck may make.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes bright orange traffic cones, arranged in a line that tapers into the right lane from the edge of the road, extending forward. These cones serve as an indication of a lane closure or ongoing road works, advising the ego vehicle to remain in its current lane without attempting to merge right.\n\nFurthermore, solid concrete barriers are present, running along both sides of the road. These barriers delineate the highway from its surrounding environment, signifying a constrained road scenario with no available shoulder area. It underscores the importance of the ego vehicle staying within its lane, simultaneously reducing the opportunities for evasive maneuvers due to the restricted environment.\n\nIn this traffic scene, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
