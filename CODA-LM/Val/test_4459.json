This forklift might move or block the lane, necessitating a lane change or stop by the ego vehicle. Additionally, in the distance on the same road, there is a white car moving away from the ego vehicle. While this car doesn't pose an immediate threat, it requires monitoring for situational awareness regarding its speed and trajectory. \n\nA traffic light in the center of the image is showing green, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed, but constant vigilance is necessary for any unexpected events. There is also green fencing on the left side, likely indicating a construction or road work area along the divider. This barrier indicates lane restrictions or potential hazards, urging caution while passing. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the image."
