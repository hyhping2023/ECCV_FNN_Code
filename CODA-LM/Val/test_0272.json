Although it is stationary now, it is pertinent to remain vigilant because the van might commence movement. Alongside the van, there is also a silver SUV and a dark-colored hatchback parked facing away from our viewpoint. These vehicles reduce the usable space on the road, although they are not posing any immediate hazard.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of pedestrians is notable on the right side of the roadâ€”some of whom are moving towards our direction, while others are walking in the opposite direction. Given that pedestrians could step onto the road, the autonomous vehicle must reduce speed and stay prepared to halt if necessary.\n\nOn the left, near the sidewalk, there's a motorcyclist with their back to the self-driving car. The possibility of the motorcyclist merging into traffic warrants our constant attention and readiness to react appropriately to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, there's a bright yellow warning sign placed on the sidewalk on the right. The sign cautions us, suggesting that a pedestrian area or crosswalk might be nearby, necessitating additional caution while driving.\n\nThe data provided does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the image, implying there are no such elements affecting the driving conditions within the visible range."

While it may not be necessary to change lanes or make turns immediately, continuous monitoring of all vulnerable road users is essential to react promptly.
