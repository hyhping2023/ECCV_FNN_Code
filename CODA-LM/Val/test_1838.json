On the left side of the ego vehicle, there's a blue sedan parked by the side of the road, partially visible. The blue sedan is stationary, and while it isn't a threat currently, it should be observed in case the car starts moving. On the right side, parallel to the road, there is a blue taxi parked, which doesn't immediately threaten the ego vehicle but could potentially block the view of incoming traffic from side roads or driveways. Further ahead on the right, a blue sedan with a white section is also parked, facing the opposite direction of the ego car's path. Its positioning suggests that if it moves onto the road, the ego car might need to react to avoid it. Beyond this car, another blue sedan is parked and might also enter the traffic flow, prompting the ego car to be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image.\n\nAdditionally, on the right sidewalk, large industrial reels are seen, but since they are not on the roadway, they do not influence the driving behavior of the ego car."
