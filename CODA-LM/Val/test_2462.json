                "description": "A large truck carrying construction equipment is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The truck is quite large and has a distinctive equipment bed at the rear.",
                "explanation": "The size and type of the truck suggests that it may move slower than smaller vehicles and could make unexpected stops or slow downs due to its operation nature. Furthermore, the presence of construction equipment indicates it may be heading to or from a construction site, potentially leading to sudden turns or maneuvers. The truck's slow speed and descending debris may require the ego car to slow down or change lanes to avoid damage or accidents. Also, debris may fall from the truck, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial."

The sedan's position may affect the ego car if a lane change is required. Monitoring its speed and trajectory is important."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle, possibly a cement mixer, characterized by its robust and high-clearance frame, a rotating drum in the rear, and multiple chutes for pouring concrete. Due to its size, the construction vehicle may be slower moving and require careful observation by the ego car to anticipate potential stops or turns. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for wide turns that the construction vehicle might make, and pay attention to any signals or brake lights from the construction vehicle to adjust driving behavior accordingly.",

It should also keep a watchful eye on the blue sedan to the left, in case it decides to change lanes. Speed adjustments and lane changes should be considered to maintain safe travelling distance and to prepare for potential maneuvers by these vehicles. Additionally, regular checks on rear-view and side mirrors are advised to stay aware of any other road users that may affect the driving scenario. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck, prepare to change lanes if the debris becomes a significant hazard, and monitor the blue sedan's position and speed while considering road conditions before making any maneuvers. Visibility concerns from the camera lens should be mitigated if possible; otherwise, the ego car should proceed more cautiously and rely on other sensors if available."
