Although the vehicle is stationary and doesn't obstruct traffic at the moment, it could become a disruption if it suddenly re-enters the roadway.\n\nTo the right, a circular speed limit sign displays \"50,\" indicating a speed limit of 50 kilometers per hour. It is essential for the vehicle to adhere to this speed limit for compliance with traffic regulations.\n\nOn the sidewalk near the speed limit sign, there is a cylindrical obstacle with reflective stripes, likely indicating roadwork or an obstruction, but it does not directly interfere with driving.\n\nAdditionally, garbage bags and debris are scattered on the sidewalk near the barrier and beside the speed limit sign. These obstacles, while currently on the sidewalk, have the potential to end up on the roadway, necessitating that the vehicle remains vigilant."

It is recommended to slow down and prepare to stop in case a dog enters the vehicle's path. Keep a safe distance from vehicles parked on the right side in case they start moving. Stay alert for vehicles pulling out from curbside parking spots into the traffic. Drive carefully, be prepared for any potential stationary obstacles ahead, and watch for any signs of road work due to obstructions on the sidewalk.",
