It has an attached flatbed loaded with materials and is colored red. Due to its position, it may cause traffic to merge left, necessitating that the ego car adjust its path to avoid the obstruction and any potential oncoming traffic.\n\nAdditionally, several construction workers are present around the vehicle, wearing high-visibility clothing and helmets. Their presence introduces a dynamic element to the roadside environment, as they could step onto the road or cause unexpected movements of construction materials or equipment. Consequently, the ego car must be cautious to ensure their safety.\n\nSurrounding the construction vehicle, bright orange traffic cones extend into the ego car's lane, signaling a taper where the right lane is closed. These cones serve to guide the ego car to merge left safely and alert the driver to the presence of roadworks, indicating the need to slow down or change lanes.\n\nFurthermore, yellow safety barriers are positioned on the right, delineating the construction zone from the carriageway. These barriers help to keep vehicles away from the construction area and signal a potential lane narrowing or diversion.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."

It should prepare to merge left if it hasn't already, while being mindful of any oncoming traffic that might be affected by the same lane closure. Additionally, the vehicle should maintain heightened awareness for any possible sudden movements by the construction workers or changes in the status of the roadwork area. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the truck and the workers while being prepared to stop. Reduce speed due to wet road conditions and the presence of a construction zone. Stay alert for any construction signage or workers directing traffic that may require further changes in driving behavior."
