    "driving_suggestion": "Given the limited visibility and the presence of large vehicles nearby, it is essential for the vehicle to maintain a safe following distance, monitor adjacent lanes for potential merging traffic, and be prepared to adjust speed or position when necessary. It is also advisable to stay alert for any traffic signs or signals that might be obscured by large vehicles. Due to low visibility and blurry images, it is recommended to reduce speed and proceed with caution, ready to respond to any unforeseen obstacles or road users that may appear upon approach. Keep a safe following distance from any vehicles ahead and be vigilant for any sudden movements or signals that may indicate changing road conditions. Additionally, ensure that the vehicle's sensors and cameras are clean and functioning properly to enhance detection capabilities and visibility. Considering the limited line of sight and unidentified vehicles, reduce speed and prepare for possible evasive maneuvers. The driver should be ready to deal with sudden changes in the road environment that may not be clearly visible in the imagery. Maintain a safe following distance from any vehicle ahead and remain alert for any additional road users or signs that may appear in your line of vision.",

It is difficult to distinguish specific features due to motion blur, but it appears to be a part of a heavy vehicle like a truck or a bus that is moving. The presence of such a large vehicle close to the ego car would require the driver to maintain a safe distance and be cautious of potential blind spots when navigating around the vehicle.",
