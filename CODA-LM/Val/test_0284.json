Additionally, there are vehicles in the opposite lane to the right of the ego car, which do not pose an immediate threat but should be observed for any unexpected maneuvers.\n\nA traffic sign is present on the right side of the road; however, its details are not clear from the image. Consequently, the ego car should proceed with caution and follow general road rules until the sign's instructions are better understood.\n\nOn the rightmost lane, there is a line of orange and white traffic cones directing traffic to merge left, indicating a lane closure or roadwork ahead. This requires the ego car to merge into the adjacent lane to avoid the affected area.\n\nLastly, yellow and black striped barriers are visible on the right side of the road, marking the boundary between the roadway and the shoulder or a restricted area. These barriers serve as a no-entry sign, ensuring that the ego car remains on the road and does not cross into the prohibited zone."

Remain vigilant for any changes in road conditions or updates from the traffic signs as you approach them. The ego car should also stay vigilant of the traffic in the opposite lane, and keep a steady position in the lane, avoiding the cones and barrier on the left. No immediate lane changes are required unless directed by traffic signs or conditions ahead. The speed should be adjusted to match the flow of traffic while being ready for possible slowdowns or stops due to the traffic ahead."
