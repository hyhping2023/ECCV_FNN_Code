Due to its size and potential for sudden stops, the ego car must maintain a safe distance. The truck's position and size may obstruct visibility and impede progress, potentially requiring a lane change.\n   - Several cars are in the opposite lane, which do not affect the immediate path of the ego car.\n   - Various cars are in the left lane and ahead in the distance, appearing to be in motion, affecting the ego car's ability to change lanes safely and its speed adjustment.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Pedestrians are crossing the street to the right of the ego car, at some distance ahead, on a zebra crossing, moving from left to right. They could be at risk if the ego car were to turn right, necessitating the ego car to yield and monitor their crossing to ensure their safety.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A blue directional signpost on the right side of the intersection indicates directions and lane information, aiding the ego car's navigation system in lane selection.\n   - A reddish-brown pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road, ahead of the cement mixer truck, signals an area where pedestrians are likely present, requiring cautious driving from the ego car.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - Traffic lights ahead are displaying red for straight lanes and a red arrow indicating no-right-turn. The ego car must stop and wait for a green signal before proceeding or turning.\n   - Another set of traffic lights visible ahead, slightly to the right, show a green signal for proceeding straight or making a left turn, with a red arrow for no-right-turn. This means the ego car can move straight or left if safe but must not turn right.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n   - A median strip with vegetation separates the opposite lanes of traffic, defining the lanes and preventing the ego car from crossing to the opposite side of the road."

For the ego car, this may mean increased caution is needed while driving nearby, as the construction vehicle could be entering or exiting a construction site, might be moving slower than other traffic, and could make sudden stops. The ego car should keep a safe distance from the construction vehicle to avoid any potential hazards such as spillage from the mixer or debris falling from the vehicle.",

It should also pay attention to pedestrians to ensure they are not at risk if any turns are possible after the light changes. Observe the direction signs to plan a proper lane position for future maneuvers. Await the green traffic light before proceeding. Maintain a safe following distance behind the cement mixer truck and prepare to either come to a stop or change lanes to the left, depending on the movements of the vehicle ahead and the traffic in the left lane. Prioritize pedestrian safety at the zebra crossing. Stay alert for traffic control devices that may affect traffic pattern, especially if the plan includes a turn at the upcoming intersection."
