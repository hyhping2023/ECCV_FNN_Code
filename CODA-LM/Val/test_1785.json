It is important for the ego vehicle to keep a safe following distance and be ready to stop or decelerate as necessary. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights to consider in this image.\n\nHowever, there is a traffic cone placed on the pedestrian path to the right, although it is further away. While the cone does not directly obstruct the vehicle's drivable path, it suggests that there might be road construction or potential hazards in proximity, and thus warrants attention.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, there is also a row of bicycles parked near the dark-colored SUV. Extra caution is advised in case any individuals move towards these parked bicycles and onto the roadway, necessitating watchfulness for emerging pedestrians."

Additionally, due to the slippery roads, the vehicle should drive with caution to ensure there is no harsh acceleration and be prepared for a longer braking distance. It is also necessary to monitor pedestrians or cyclists who may be difficult to see due to insufficient lighting. Anticipate the potential movements of other vehicles around parked ones, and proceed to drive only when it is safe and legal to do so.",

Positioned near the side of the road, it is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and anticipate potential movement around the dustbin, such as pedestrians approaching to dispose of waste or the presence of waste collection services.
