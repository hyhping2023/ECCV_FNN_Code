The ego car should be prepared to slow down or navigate around the work zone as necessary.\n\nOther objects observed include a dustbin to the side of the road, carts and bicycles parked on the sidewalk, and construction materials stacked outside of a shop front. While these objects do not directly impact the driving path, they suggest a busy or potentially congested area where pedestrians may be nearby, and thus require attention.\n\nBicycles are also seen stacked on the side of the road near the storefront. These do not pose a direct threat to the ego car's path but should be noted in case of unexpected movement or if a bicycle is taken onto the road.\n\nLastly, a variety of objects such as air conditioners, ladders, and construction materials are in front of the shop. These items indicate a potential obstruction or distraction near the road, and although they are not on the road itself, they should be monitored for any changes that could affect driving conditions."
