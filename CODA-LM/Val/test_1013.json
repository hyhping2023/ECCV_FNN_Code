        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable vehicles. Firstly, a large yellow construction truck equipped with a crane is positioned directly in front of my vehicle within our lane, taking up the full width of the lane. The presence of this construction truck is significant because its size and position could obstruct the travel path of the self-driving car. As a result, the autonomous vehicle might need to slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe following distance and to be prepared for any potential stopping or turning of the truck. Secondly, in the adjacent lane on the left, there is a white sedan traveling in the opposite direction to our vehicle. The proximity of the sedan to our car is of importance as it could influence our car's decisions regarding changing lanes. \n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not have any entries in this observation, indicating they are not present or relevant in this specific traffic scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead and pay attention to any changes in its lights. Based on the actions of the construction vehicle and the conditions in the adjacent lane where the white sedan is located, be prepared to change lanes or slow down as necessary. Drivers must be vigilant for any sudden factors, such as the construction vehicle stopping abruptly or vehicles turning at intersections, especially as they approach the intersection.",

This vehicle typically has limited maneuverability and may travel at slower speeds, necessitating additional caution from the driver of the ego vehicle. Given the truck's position on the road, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to account for the truck's potential deceleration and ensure adequate reaction time for any unforeseen stops or turns the truck might make.",
