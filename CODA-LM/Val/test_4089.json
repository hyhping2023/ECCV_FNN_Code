A large truck with an open back filled with rubble is directly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane and traveling in the same direction. This truck's presence and heavy load could cause debris to fall on the road, posing a hazard. Additionally, its slow speed may require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes.\n2. A white sedan is parked on the right side of the street, ahead of an SUV that is also parked. These parked vehicles raise the possibility of doors opening or pedestrians emerging, necessitating caution from the ego car.\n3. Another blue truck is in the opposite lane, facing the opposite direction. While this oncoming truck does not directly impact the immediate driving decisions of the ego car, awareness is needed in case it starts moving.\n4. A blue truck is parked further ahead on the right side of the road. This stationary vehicle does not directly affect driving behavior but contributes to understanding the local traffic norms and parking behaviors.\n\nAdditionally, the scene contains **other objects**:\n1. Visible debris is on the right side of the road. This debris can be a potential hazard requiring the ego vehicle to avoid it while staying in the lane or when considering a lane change.\n2. There appears to be a shop or garage on the right side with various objects that could obstruct the sidewalk or road margin. These objects, while not immediately on the road, signal an area where pedestrians or other vehicles might be encountered unexpectedly.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are detected in this traffic image."

Given its size and the nature of the equipment it is carrying, it may move slower than regular traffic and will require extra caution when being overtaken. The ego car should maintain a safe distance to allow for sudden stops or changes in the construction vehicle's speed and direction. The presence of this vehicle also indicates the possible presence of a construction zone ahead, so the driver of the ego car should be prepared for potential delays, detours, or roadwork signs.",

Overtake with caution, only if the opposite lane is clear and it's safe to do so, considering the wet road surface and potential obstacles. Stay vigilant for any unexpected movements from parked vehicles. Drive cautiously with moderate speed due to the road surface conditions. Be watchful for any road users that may emerge from the parked vehicles or the shop area on the right. Due to the road condition, adjust speed to ensure a safe travel experience and maintain control of the vehicle on the uneven surface. Monitor rear-view mirrors for vehicles approaching from behind who might not anticipate the slower speeds."
