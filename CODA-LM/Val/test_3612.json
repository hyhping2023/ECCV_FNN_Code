Although it's difficult to discern the make and model due to low light conditions, this vehicle does not obstruct the ego car's path. However, caution is advised as its position may indicate a potential hazard ahead or the possibility of passengers alighting.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: A series of traffic cones are positioned on the road, forming a barrier that narrows the drivable path on the right side. These cones likely indicate a work zone or detour, directing traffic to shift or merge left to avoid the coned-off area.\n\n- **Barriers**: Reflective barriers are visible beyond the traffic cones on the right, helping to mark a no-drive or construction zone. These barriers imply that part of the road ahead is closed, necessitating that the ego car maneuvers to the left."

Typically, it is orange with reflective stripes for visibility and is used to direct vehicles by demarcating areas where driving is prohibited, such as construction zones or accident sites. In this scenario, the placement of the traffic cone suggests that there may be road work ahead, an obstruction, or a change in the traffic pattern. It signals the driver to stay alert, slow down, and possibly prepare to merge into another lane or follow an altered traffic path.",

The driver should be alert for any other unexpected obstacles or road users that may be difficult to see due to the nighttime conditions. Ensure headlights and taillights are on for visibility. Monitor the parked vehicle on the side for any signs of movement or pedestrians that may enter the roadway."
