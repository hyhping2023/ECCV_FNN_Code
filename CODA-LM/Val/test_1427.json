The truck's size and close proximity may influence lane-changing decisions and require maintaining a safe following distance.\n  - Various vehicles are ahead in the same lane as the ego car, appearing as rectangular shapes in the distance. These vehicles dictate the speed and flow of traffic for the ego car, necessitating readiness to adapt to their movements and potential braking.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A construction worker dressed in bright reflective clothing is located on the right side of the road near a construction barrier. Their proximity to the road and potential to enter the driving lane call for increased caution and preparedness to slow down or stop if necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Orange traffic cones are placed in a line between the construction zone and the road on the right side, leading up to the construction worker. These cones signify a delineated work zone and necessitate that the ego car maintain a safe distance from the designated area.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Jersey barriers are situated on the right side between the road and the construction zone. These barriers indicate a construction zone which may affect road width and require the ego car to stay toward the left within the lane to maintain a safe distance.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - Construction equipment and debris are scattered around the construction zone on the right side, not directly on the driving lane but close to the roadside. The presence of such objects near the driving lane warrants vigilance for potential unexpected impediments or debris spillage onto the road."

Reduce speed and exercise caution when approaching the construction zone, staying alert to the worker and machinery that may encroach on the driving lane. Stay within the lane markers and avoid distractions to safely navigate past the construction area. The ego car should maintain a steady speed, keep a safe following distance behind the vehicles ahead, and remain aware of the tanker truck's position if a lane change is required. Care should be taken to avoid being in the truck's blind spot. Additionally, caution is necessary when passing the construction zone on the right; the car should steer slightly left within the lane to avoid the barriers and respect the workers' safety, while being prepared to respond to any sudden obstructions or changes in road conditions."
