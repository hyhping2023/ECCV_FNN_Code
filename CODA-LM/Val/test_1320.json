        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large truck on the left side, positioned in the leftmost lane and traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. The truck has its taillights on, which could indicate that it is either slowing down or preparing to stop. This presence of the truck is significant as it may influence our vehicle's speed and lane choice, especially if the truck is moving slower than the rest of the traffic or if our vehicle needs to overtake.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous red and white traffic cones arranged in a row, demarcating the boundary between the construction area on the right side of the road and the lanes that are open for traffic. The cones serve as a warning for a lane reduction and potential hazards due to the roadwork. As a result, drivers, including the autonomous system of our vehicle, should exercise caution, potentially reducing speed to navigate this area safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

When changing lanes, exercise caution, and be ready to slow down or stop at any time due to construction zones and instructions from electronic signs.",
