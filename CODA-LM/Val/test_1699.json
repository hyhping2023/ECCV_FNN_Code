A motorcycle is ahead on the right side, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The motorcycle can affect how the autonomous vehicle performs overtaking maneuvers. The vehicle is advised to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes to overtake the motorcycle without compromising safety.\n\nAdditionally, the autonomous vehicle must adhere to road signage, specifically a round blue sign with a white arrow pointing right, which denotes that turning right is mandatory. This will affect the vehicle's speed and lane positioning in preparation for the turn.\n\nOrange traffic cones are also set up on the left side of the road, suggesting ongoing roadwork or maintenance. The autonomous vehicle needs to keep a safe distance from this potential hazard area and stay alert for any workers or unforeseen obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, orange and blue barriers on the right side of the road indicate construction or a restricted zone. These barriers require the vehicle to possibly adjust its lateral movement to the left for safety clearance.\n\nLastly, construction machinery is parked within the cordoned-off area on the right side of the road, pointing to active work. This could entail unexpected movements or obstructions, and thus the vehicle's awareness and readiness to react to these possible scenarios must be heightened."

Be prepared to follow the mandatory direction indicated by the traffic sign and turn right. Exercise caution due to the construction barriers and potential changes in road conditions caused by the parked construction machinery. Adjust speed appropriately for the wet road conditions to ensure safety. Caution should be exercised due to the presence of the fence barrier which could suggest nearby roadwork and potential disruptions or obstructions in the lane ahead. Given the current scenario, prepare to take the mandatory right turn as indicated by the traffic sign, and adjust its lateral position slightly to the left to avoid the blue barrier and stay clear of the construction area marked by traffic cones. It is advisable to check the mirrors and blind spots before overtaking the motorcycle, ensuring that it is done safely and within the speed limit."
