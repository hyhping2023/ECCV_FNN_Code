This vehicle is a significant obstruction to the ego car's path and could potentially stop suddenly, necessitating careful attention from the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a white passenger car is parked on the left side of the road, providing an opportunity for the ego car to overtake the construction vehicle from the left, if conditions permit.\n\nTo the right of the road, there are traffic signs with symbols indicating a construction zone ahead, with text in a foreign language. These signs warn of potential roadwork or changes in traffic patterns, signaling the ego car to be prepared for detours or road obstructions.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on the left side of the road, suggesting lane restrictions or a closed-off area, which means the ego car cannot change lanes in that direction.\n\nLastly, there are piles of construction materials and debris on the side of the road, which could obscure visibility and reduce the drivable space, requiring the ego car to remain cautious."
