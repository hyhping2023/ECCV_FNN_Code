        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, the road users and objects are categorized into vulnerable road users, barriers, and other objects, with no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present.\n\nA light-colored dog is noticed walking on the right side of the road, moving away from our vehicle. The presence of the dog is significant as it introduces an unpredictable element to the road environment. Dogs can change direction or enter the road abruptly, necessitating cautious driving and a constant readiness to stop to avoid potential accidents.\n\nAdditionally, a series of white obstacles equipped with reflective materials are set up along the right edge of the road, following the pedestrian area and extending into the distance. These obstacles serve as a warning to drivers, indicating areas that are off-limits to vehicles. They suggest a reduction in the available driving space on the right side of the road, requiring drivers to adjust their driving path accordingly.\n\nOn the left side of the road, several white bags or objects are neatly arranged beside a building. While these objects do not directly obstruct the vehicle's path, they still warrant attention. The possibility of these objects moving or causing sudden hazards should be considered, emphasizing the need for vigilance.\n\nIn summary, the traffic image highlights the importance of being attentive to both static and dynamic elements within the road environment, ranging from animals like dogs to barriers and other objects that might influence driving decisions and paths."

    "driving_suggestion": "In the presence of a parked active vehicle and a wandering dog, the vehicle should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe speed, and be ready to stop at any moment. The driver should monitor the movements of the dog and give it ample space to avoid startling it and to safely navigate around. Moreover, be prepared for any potential movements of nearby individuals who may be obscured by parked vans or roadside objects. Slow down immediately, providing plenty of reaction time for passing dogs. Exercise caution and continuously observe vehicles in the opposing lane. In conditions of low visibility, maintain a safe speed and be vigilant for any unexpected obstacles or road users that might be harder to detect at this time. Be ready to stop or gently maneuver the vehicle to avoid the dog, while not veering into oncoming traffic or roadside objects.",
