Stay alert to any dynamics around parked vehicles and be prepared to adjust your speed or position at any time in response to traffic cones ahead. Additionally, pay attention to the location of roadside lanterns to prevent them from falling into the driving path. It is recommended to regularly check rearview mirrors and the surrounding environment to stay informed of any changes or new obstacles. Considering pedestrians crossing the street and vehicles parked in a way that may obstruct the lane, the vehicle should slow down, signal when necessary to change lanes, and be prepared to stop to allow pedestrians to pass safely. Remain vigilant for other road users who may be obscured by parked vehicles and ensure the road is clear before proceeding.",
