The van is partially visible with obstructed lighting conditions that make it difficult to ascertain its state, and there appears to be a flat tire on the left visible side. The placement of the van could suggest that it is a stopped or disabled vehicle, which may unexpectedly enter the traffic flow or indicate the presence of pedestrians nearby who may be around the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a distant traffic light that is visible, illuminated with a blueish light. However, the light seems to be located on another street or at a significant distance. Due to this distance and the unusual color of the illumination, it is challenging to determine the precise state of this traffic light and its impact on the ego car's current route and driving behavior."

Extra caution should be taken as the road users might not be easily visible, and the status of the distant traffic light should be monitored if it becomes relevant as the ego car approaches it."
