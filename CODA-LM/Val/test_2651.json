The headlights and all available night vision systems should be used to enhance visibility and situational awareness. This vehicle must wait until the traffic light turns green and the traffic ahead begins to move before proceeding. Due to low visibility, the speed should be reduced, following distance increased, and proper lighting used to improve visibility. Remain vigilant for road users or traffic control devices that may suddenly appear obscured due to darkness.",

Its purpose is to regulate the flow of vehicles at an intersection by providing visual cues indicating when it is safe to proceed. The red light instructs drivers to come to a complete stop. For the ego car, this means halting at the designated stopping point such as a crosswalk or stop line and waiting for the light to change to green before continuing.",
