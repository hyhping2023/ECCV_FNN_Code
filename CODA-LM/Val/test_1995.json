        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are no vehicles detected, which simplifies the driving environment to some extent. However, there are other critical elements present that influence driving behavior.\n\nVulnerable road users are represented by a group of pedestrians located on the right side of the road. They are at some distance and walking away from this lane, separated from the road by certain obstacles. Although they do not directly impede the vehicle's path currently, their presence requires monitoring. The concern is if anyone attempts to cross or approach the driving lanes unexpectedly, which could pose a potential threat.\n\nNo traffic signs or traffic lights are noted in this image, indicating the absence of immediate regulatory instructions or light-based directions for the ego vehicle to follow.\n\nThe presence of orange traffic cones is significant. They are arranged in a line also on the right side of the road, clearly demarcating the driving lane. This setup suggests a part of the road might be closed or restricted, indicating that the vehicle must adjust its lane position accordingly. The cones serve as a reminder not to enter the isolated area, guiding the vehicle's path away from potential hazards.\n\nA metal fence is observed on the right, effectively separating the pedestrian area from the motor vehicle lanes. This barrier plays a crucial role in guiding the flow of traffic and preventing pedestrians from entering the lanes, ensuring a safer driving route for the vehicle.\n\nLastly, on the left side of the road, there is another fencing structure that segregates the sidewalk from the roadway. This ensures pedestrian safety by preventing them from entering the traffic lanes and aids in guiding self-driving vehicles by clearly marking the road boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the observed traffic scene mainly entails non-vehicle elements that contribute to the safety and regulation of driving behavior. The notable presence of pedestrians, traffic cones, and barriers requires continuous monitoring and adaptive driving strategies to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should continue to travel in the current lane, while monitoring the distance of pedestrians on the right to ensure they do not walk onto the roadway. Be prepared to react to the information displayed on the overhead digital signs, adjusting speed or lane position if necessary. The traffic cones on the right indicate a possible lane reduction or construction ahead, so the driver should pay attention to changes in lane availability and decelerate according to road signs or road conditions. The vehicle should proceed with caution, obeying speed limits, and remain vigilant for changes in traffic lights or sudden pedestrian movements. The vehicle should also stay in a lane not blocked by traffic cones and prepare for actions that might be needed for obstacles ahead, such as slowing down to pass through a toll booth. In addition, the vehicle should continue towards the toll booth or checkpoint, be ready to stop or pay if necessary, and choose an open lane as it approaches the toll area.",

The cones in the image may indicate areas where vehicles are not permitted to pass or might suggest that there is ongoing road work or a temporary roadway layout change. The presence of these cones influences the future driving behavior of the ego car by indicating it should steer clear of the delineated area to avoid any hazards or restrictions.",
