Firstly, there is a large concrete mixer truck directly in front of our vehicle, occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The presence of this truck is significant as it dictates the following distance and speed that our vehicle must maintain to ensure safe driving conditions.\n\nAdditionally, a silver sedan is observed to the right front of our car, positioned in the adjacent lane and making a right turn. This requires our vehicle to monitor the sedan closely for any potential lane changes, and be prepared to adjust our speed or lane position to maintain safety.\n\nOn the left side ahead, there is a white sedan driving in the opposite direction to our car. While this sedan is not currently an obstacle, its movements need to be tracked in case it decides to change lanes or alter its speed, which could then impact our driving strategy.\n\nThe traffic light that is visible ahead displays a green light for our direction, allowing us to proceed, while the cross traffic is faced with a red light. It is important for our vehicle to continue with caution, being mindful of the possibility that other vehicles might disregard the red light and cross our path.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect our driving behavior."

Remain vigilant for any behavioral changes in the aforementioned vehicles or changes in traffic lights. At the same time, pay attention to the white sedan and anticipate any potential lane changes or speed adjustments.",

As a heavy-duty vehicle typically used for construction or engineering tasks, its presence suggests potential nearby construction activity. The vehicle appears to be stationary, possibly waiting for the traffic signal or due to work in the area. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible stops or reduced speed. It may also be necessary to be cautious of sudden movements from this vehicle if it is actively participating in construction activities.",
