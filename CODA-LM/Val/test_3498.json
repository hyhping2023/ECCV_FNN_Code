The proximity of these workers to the roadway introduces a risk; they could enter the driving lane unexpectedly or cause obstructions.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow road sign with black stripes is erected on the right side, signaling an upcoming change in the traffic pattern due to the work zone. The ego car should be ready to adapt to potential merges or decelerations.\n\nA pair of marked traffic cones is placed on the right, indicating the start of the work area and guiding the ego car to remain to the left and steer clear of the maintenance zone. \n\nA temporary fence or barrier is set up as a buffer between the roadway and the workers, offering a physical deterrent to prevent accidental encroachment into the work zone by the ego car.\n\nScattered around the worksite, debris or maintenance equipment is present, underscoring the chance of encountering random road hazards that may be inadvertently moved into the path of the ego car."
