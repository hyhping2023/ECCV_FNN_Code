Another vehicle detected has its taillights illuminated and seems to be on the right side of the road ahead, possibly indicating that it's parking, stopping, or turning, all actions that could influence the surrounding traffic flow.\n\nThere's a green traffic light visible at a distance, signaling that it is safe for the ego car to proceed, yet caution is advised in anticipation of a potential change to the light as the car draws near the intersection.\n\nReflective traffic cones have been positioned in a line on the right side of the ego car's lane, which appear to define a driving path. These cones usually mean there is either ongoing road work or an obstruction ahead, signaling that the ego car should slow down and be ready to adjust its course accordingly.\n\nAlso discernible is a metal barrier located on the far right side of the scene, implying there may be a closed area or construction in progress. This barrier serves as an indication that the part of the roadway is off limits, thus, the ego car must navigate past it while maintaining a safe berth.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, and other objects are not present in the image."
