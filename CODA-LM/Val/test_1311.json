These traffic cones hint that certain areas of the road might be inaccessible to vehicles.\n\nRed and white barriers, partially visible in the foreground, denote closed-off sections due to the ongoing construction work. These barriers delineate the boundaries of the construction zone and indicate routes that are temporarily unavailable, suggesting that drivers should either detour or proceed with caution.\n\nAnother noteworthy object is a heavy-duty excavator in operation, with its bucket in a lifted position filled with dirt. This machinery signifies active construction activities, likely leading to temporary road closures or requiring detours and caution due to possible unexpected movements or hazards on the road."

Excavators are typically used for digging, material handling, landscaping, demolition, and construction. The presence of this machinery suggests construction activity is happening nearby.
