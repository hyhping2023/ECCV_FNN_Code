Additionally, several vehicles are parked on the right side of the road, some of which encroach onto the sidewalk, thus narrowing the road and requiring cautious driving to avoid side scraping.\n\nOn the right side of the road, several construction workers wearing high-visibility vests are seen. Their proximity to the road and potential for sudden movement necessitates careful driving and readiness to stop or slow down.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are arrayed on the right side, indicating road construction or a lane closure ahead. These cones urge the vehicle to stay to the right and remain alert for any worker or equipment movement.\n\nMetal guardrails on the left side separate opposing lanes or road sections, restricting lateral movement options and compelling the vehicle to stay in its current lane.\n\nLastly, a green bicycle is leaning against a metal railing on the left, without a nearby cyclist. While the bicycle itself is not a direct hazard, its presence signals potential activities in the area that should be monitored."

    "driving_suggestion": "When driving your own vehicle, it's important to maintain a safe distance from the delivery van in front, always be ready to stop, and carefully navigate lanes narrowed due to parked vehicles and road construction. You should also reduce speed on wet and slippery roads to prevent hydroplaning and ensure the safety of all road users. Be vigilant for workers who may be near the roadside, and be ready to adjust your position to avoid traffic cones while also respecting the metal barriers on the left. With wet road surfaces, exercise caution while driving, stay alert, and look out for any other road users or obstacles that may emerge from either side of the road.",
