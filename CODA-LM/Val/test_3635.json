However, there are several elements that require attention. Traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, indicating a construction or maintenance area, and suggest that the lane ahead may be partially obstructed, signaling the need for a potential lane shift or speed reduction to ensure safety. Additionally, there are temporary barriers and fencing enclosing a construction site on the right, which may influence the road's width, prompting drivers to be vigilant and possibly merge to the left if the road narrows. Lastly, large cylindrical concrete structures are also situated on the right side of the road. These structures could be waiting for transportation or installation, and they reinforce the need for drivers to exercise caution due to the potential reduction in drivable road space."
