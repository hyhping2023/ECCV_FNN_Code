Its rear and brake lights are visible, suggesting it may be moving slowly or is stationary.",
                "explanation": "The presence and proximity of the truck directly influence the speed and following distance of the ego vehicle to maintain a safe driving distance and prepare for any potential sudden stops or turns by the truck. Due to its size, the truck limits visibility ahead and requires the ego vehicle to either slow down or change lanes to proceed safely."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a large, brown-coloured container truck visible in the lane ahead of the ego vehicle. The truck's container is marked with the number FC6120, which suggests it is in close proximity and traveling in the same direction. Its rear and brake lights appear to be engaged, indicating that the truck might be moving very slowly or is stopped. The presence and nearness of the truck necessitates that the ego vehicle adjusts its speed and increases its following distance to ensure safe driving conditions. Additionally, the truck's substantial size obstructs the forward view, creating a situation where the ego vehicle must consider decelerating or safely changing lanes to continue on its path. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large motor vehicle designed for transporting cargo. It has a sizeable rectangular structure for carrying goods. In the driving scenario, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle due to its large size which could obscure road visibility ahead and require longer braking distances when the vehicle comes to a halt. The ego vehicle should be ready to adjust speed or switch lanes if necessary to ensure safety and smooth flow of traffic.",

Continue monitoring the truck's brake lights for any indication of slowing or stopping, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if needed to ensure safety and the smooth flow of traffic. Keep headlights and taillights on to ensure maximum visibility for the ego vehicle and for other road users to see the ego vehicle. The ego car's lighting systems should be utilized to enhance visibility, and speed should be adjusted to accommodate for reduced visibility and reaction times at night."
