        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two notable vehicle-related observations. Firstly, a yellow construction truck is stopped in the same lane ahead of our vehicle. The presence of this truck is significant as it occupies multiple lanes and may either stop or travel slowly. Due to this, caution is advised, and it may be necessary to adjust our vehicle's speed or change the lane position to maintain safety.\n\nSecondly, in the lane to the left of our vehicle, there are vehicles traveling in the opposite direction, parallel to our vehicle. The proximity of these vehicles restricts our ability to change lanes to the left. It is important to keep a close watch on these vehicles for any unexpected lane changes or stops that could influence our vehicle's trajectory.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, so these categories do not require any action or consideration in this particular scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the construction truck ahead, ready for any potential stops or slowdowns due to road work. Frequently checking the rearview mirrors is very important for staying aware of your surroundings, especially when quick reactions are necessary. Additionally, your vehicle should monitor the left-side traffic, and prepare to change lanes to the left to avoid the construction truck when it is safe to do so. Approaching intersections, also pay attention to changes in traffic lights and be ready to stop if necessary. Lane changes should only be executed after confirming there are no vehicles in the adjacent lane and the turn signal has been correctly indicated.",
