This suggests a potential crossing or turning movement, requiring the ego vehicle to remain cautious and prepared to stop.\n    - Several vehicles are parked on the side of the road to the right, alongside the moving traffic. These parked vehicles may obstruct the view and could pose risks like doors opening or pedestrians emerging unexpectedly.\n    - A yellow truck is on the right, facing forward parallel to the ego vehicle's lane, with visible exhaust plumes indicating it has recently started or is idling. The truck might merge into traffic, necessitating the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and monitor the truck's indicators.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n    - A group of pedestrians is gathered around a traffic object near the right edge of the lane ahead of the ego vehicle, with one person appearing to be a worker in high-visibility clothing. This scenario calls for reduced speed and heightened vigilance to avoid a potential collision, especially as pedestrians may step into the road unexpectedly.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n    - Red and white striped temporary warning signs are visible on the right side of the road, indicating a work area or another temporary hazard. These signs signal restrictions like reduced speed limits and require the driver to stay alert for changes in traffic patterns.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n    - Traffic cones are set up around the temporary work area on the right to guide traffic away from the work zone. These cones indicate potential road work, necessitating slower speeds and cautious driving to maneuver around them safely.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n    - Barricade signs with diagonal stripes are positioned on the road next to the truck on the right. These barriers suggest that a section of the roadway may be closed or have restricted access, instructing the ego vehicle to avoid this area.\n\nNo additional objects such as debris or dustbins are present in the traffic image."
