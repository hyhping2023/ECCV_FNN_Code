A yellow bus is traveling in the right lane ahead of the ego car, displaying a destination on its rear sign. The ego car must account for the bus's potential stops or deceleration to pick up and drop off passengers. The bus's size may also obscure visibility ahead, requiring extra caution.\n2. A blue car is driving in the left lane parallel to the ego vehicle, positioned slightly ahead. The proximity and parallel trajectory of this vehicle necessitates maintaining a safe distance and monitoring for any potential lane changes.\n3. Several cars are visible ahead on the road, traveling in both left and right lanes. Their speed, direction, and any lane changes will affect the ego car's driving decisions, such as maintaining safe following distances and anticipating stops or turns.\n\n**Traffic Cones**: \nRed and white traffic cones are forming a barrier on the right side of the road, starting from the ego car's position and continuing into the distance. These cones indicate that a section of the road or a lane is closed off for some reason, which may necessitate a lane change or reduced speed from the ego car. \n\n**Barriers**: \n1. Permanent metal barriers are separating the oncoming traffic lanes from the ego car's lane. These barriers dictate that overtaking must be done only through the left lane, ensuring no illegal or dangerous maneuvers across the median.\n2. Temporary plastic barriers are alongside the cones, further indicating a closed-off area or ongoing roadwork. These reinforce the presence of a road condition that necessitates cautious driving and potential traffic pattern changes.\n\n**Other Objects**: \nA bus stop shelter is on the right side of the road beyond the coned-off area. The presence of a bus stop suggests potential for pedestrians or stopped buses ahead, which may affect traffic flow and require the ego car to slow down or stop.\n\nThere are no visible vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights in this image that require any immediate action."
