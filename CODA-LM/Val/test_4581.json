The truck is occupying the right side of the two-lane road and driving in the same direction as the ego car. Due to the truck's size and potential for unpredictable movements from the crane arm, the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential lane changes or stops by the truck.\n\nAdditionally, the road has yellow edge lines and white dash lane markings, which are crucial for lane keeping. These markings indicate that the ego car is on a multi-lane road where overtaking is likely permitted."

Its presence on the road suggests possible delays due to construction ahead. The ego car should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe following distance, and be prepared for potential changes in traffic patterns or reduced speed limits. It is also important to pay attention to any signage that might indicate detours or specific instructions related to the construction work. If the vehicle is moving slowly, the ego car might need to consider changing lanes when it is safe to do so to maintain the flow of traffic.",

Additionally, the ego car should be aware of the reduced visibility due to fog and adjust speed and following distances accordingly. Lane markings should be closely followed to remain within the correct lane."
