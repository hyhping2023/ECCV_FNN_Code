        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several parked vehicles along the side of the road. These vehicles are noticeable due to their outlines and reflective properties. The presence of these parked vehicles necessitates cautious driving as they decrease the available road width and could potentially hide other road users, such as pedestrians. Additionally, there is the risk of parked car doors opening or pedestrians emerging suddenly, which could pose a danger to the autonomous driving system.\n\nThere is also ambient lighting visible in the distance, although no specific shapes can be identified. This lighting indicates that the surrounding area is likely developed and might contain unlit hazards or road users. This suggests the need for the autonomous system to be vigilant for unexpected obstacles that may not be directly illuminated. \n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers to report on."

Maintain a lower speed to ensure adequate reaction time for unseen obstacles or road users. Be alert for any reflective signs or movement from pedestrians that may not be visible at first glance. Keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles to prevent collisions with opening doors or unexpected pedestrian movement. Reduce speed and increase attention due to low visibility conditions. Use headlights appropriately and remain vigilant for any hard-to-see road users or changes in the road environment. Be prepared to stop or maneuver safely if unexpected obstacles are encountered. Due to limited visibility and parked vehicles on the side of the road, it is advised to proceed with caution at a reduced speed. Maintain heightened awareness for any unexpected obstacles or road users, especially near the parked vehicles. Using high beams if there are no oncoming vehicles could aid in increasing visibility. Additionally, prepare to stop or maneuver carefully in case of sudden appearances of pedestrians or other road users from between the parked cars."
