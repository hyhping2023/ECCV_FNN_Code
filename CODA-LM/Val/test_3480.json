        "description and explanation": "The traffic image presents several elements that impact driving conditions for the ego vehicle. There is a red forklift ahead on the same side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. It has a green cover on its load. This forklift may influence the lane choice and movements of the ego vehicle, given its size and the potential for unexpected turns or maneuvers that could encroach upon the ego car's lane.\n\nIn addition to the forklift, there is a set of red traffic lights positioned directly over the intersection ahead. The presence of the red light is an immediate cue for the ego vehicle, requiring it to decelerate and stop, waiting for the lights to change to green before it can proceed.\n\nFinally, there is a green barrier that is impeding a portion of the right side of the lane to the left of the ego vehicle. The barrier seems associated with construction or changes in lane arrangements. This obstruction reduces lane width and dictates traffic flow, meaning the ego vehicle must exercise caution and consider potential lane changes to navigate past it safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the ego vehicle's driving decisions."

It is typically used for moving large loads of materials such as bricks, steel or dirt. In this driving scenario, its presence indicates active construction work, which may affect traffic patterns. The ego car should exercise caution, reduce speed if necessary, be prepared for unexpected obstructions or changes in traffic flow, and obey any temporary traffic signals or signs that may be in place due to the construction activities.",

It should also monitor the forklift closely for any unexpected maneuvers, being ready to adjust lane position if necessary while ensuring it doesn't conflict with the barrier's lane restrictions. Remain vigilant until the traffic light turns green and the way is clear to proceed. Additionally, the driver should watch for any signage or changes in lane configurations ahead due to the green fencing on the right side."
