        "description and explanation": "The data indicates that there are blue guardrails aligned along the edge of bridges or interchanges within the visual field. These guardrails serve as demarcation lines indicating the limits of the roadway. The presence of these barriers is crucial for autonomous driving vehicles as they function to guide the vehicle's path, ensuring that the vehicle does not deviate from the road. For safety reasons, it is essential for the self-driving car to maintain a suitable distance from these obstacles. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the data. Therefore, these categories are not relevant in this context and are excluded from the summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "When turning, the vehicle needs to adjust its speed based on road conditions and the dynamics of the curve, and stay within the lane markings and blue obstacles. Since there are no visible or lacking other road users, traffic signs, or signals in the image, no immediate action is required. Maintain the current lane while monitoring the speed and behavior of the vehicle ahead. Apart from standard driving vigilance and adhering to road rules, no other immediate actions are necessary. Continue to observe any changes in traffic or road conditions.",

As a non-stationary object that can become airborne easily, it could pose a risk if it obscures the driver's vision or distracts them. The driver of the ego vehicle should be prepared for the possibility that the object could move due to wind or passing vehicles, remain vigilant, and be ready to react accordingly without overcorrecting or swerving unpredictably, which could lead to loss of vehicle control.",
