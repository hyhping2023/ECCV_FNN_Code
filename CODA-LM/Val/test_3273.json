        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, multiple road users and objects are present, influencing the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, a large yellow truck is notable for driving in the same direction as the ego car, positioned in the right lane ahead. The presence of the truck is significant as it could potentially slow down the traffic flow or come to an abrupt stop, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe following distance to avoid any collisions.\n\nAdditionally, a smaller white vehicle is observed further ahead in the left lane, also moving in the same trajectory as the ego car. The existence of this white vehicle is crucial for the ego car to note, especially if it attempts to change lanes or if the vehicle influences the overall traffic dynamics in any manner.\n\nThere is also a sedan positioned to the right and slightly ahead of the ego car, occupying the adjacent lane. The ego car must consider the sedan's location when planning to overtake the truck, ensuring that any lane changes are executed safely, without entering the sedan's blind spots or causing disruption in traffic flow.\n\nRegarding road infrastructure and signs, an indistinct banner is attached to a light pole on the right side of the road. Due to the distance, the text on the banner cannot be discerned, making it unclear if it holds any traffic relevance. This uncertainty means the banner may not significantly influence driving behavior unless it is later identified to display traffic-related information.\n\nMoreover, orange traffic cones are set up on the right side of the right lane, hinting at a section of the lane being cordoned off, possibly due to road work or an incident. These cones necessitate that vehicles, including the ego car, adhere to lane boundaries and avoid entering the restricted area to ensure safe passage alongside the work zone or incident site.\n\nThe traffic scene is devoid of vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, and other miscellaneous objects that might impact the driving dynamics for the ego car, focusing attention primarily on vehicles, a nondescript banner, and traffic cones as key elements to navigate in this environment."

While following the truck, it should also keep an eye on the smaller white vehicle on the left lane and the sedan in the adjacent lane for any lane changes. Given the presence of traffic cones, the ego vehicle should be prepared to alter its lane position slightly to avoid the coned-off area, adhering to lane discipline and being prepared for narrowed lanes ahead. No immediate action is required in response to the banner sign or other objects not impacting road use. Always be ready to adapt to any changes in the traffic situation ahead."
