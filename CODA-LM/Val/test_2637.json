This indicates that it is a heavy vehicle which we need to be wary of. Due to the nature of this truck, it requires a larger following distance, and we must be alert to any unforeseen stops or sharp turns it may make, demanding extra caution.\n\nAdditionally, there is at least one traffic light visible in the direction we are heading that is showing red. This necessitates the autonomous vehicle to stop completely at the intersection to comply with traffic laws, irrespective of the movements of the cement mixer truck or any other vehicles in the vicinity. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene that impact the driving situation."

When stopping, a safe distance should be maintained from the cement mixer in the adjacent lane, and its movements should be monitored for any unexpected shifts, especially since such heavy vehicles may require more time to accelerate from a stop or could suddenly change position when starting. Additionally, our vehicle should keep the intersection clear and not block any pedestrian crosswalks, ensuring that invisible road users such as pedestrians or cyclists can pass through safely when permitted.",

The presence of this vehicle suggests that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be cautious of the truck's larger blind spots and potentially wider turns. Additionally, these vehicles often have slower acceleration and deceleration, so the ego car should prepare for unexpected stops or slow movement.",
