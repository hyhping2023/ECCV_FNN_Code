This pedestrian's position could potentially intersect with the vehicle's trajectory, requiring the driver to monitor their movement closely.\n\nNo visible traffic signs directly influence the ego car's decision-making in this frame. In the absence of such signs, standard road rules and situational awareness will guide driving decisions.\n\nThere are no traffic lights visible in the image, suggesting that this might not be a formal intersection. Consequently, driving decisions should be based on prevailing road conditions and other road users.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are placed alongside barriers, indicating possible construction work or a roadblock. This scenario suggests upcoming lane closures or changes in traffic patterns, which the ego car needs to be prepared to navigate.\n\nTemporary fencing surrounds the white van on the right side of the road, extending into the road and forming a blockade. These barriers could narrow the drivable lane, requiring the ego car to slow down or change lanes to avoid them.\n\nVarious objects and potential debris from construction work are noted on the roadside. These could present hazards, necessitating that the ego car makes steering adjustments or lane changes to avoid them."
