Consequently, the ego car needs to keep a safe following distance and be ready to stop or decelerate. Further ahead, there are various vehicles with their rear lights visible; this suggests a potential line of traffic that is either moving slowly or is halted, requiring the ego car to stay alert to the traffic flow and slow down when needed.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, in the same lane, there is a blue hatchback with its brake lights activated, facing forward. This situation again calls for maintaining safe following distance and preparedness for potential stopping or slowing. Overhead to the right, a directional traffic sign with arrows indicates a fork in the road, informing the ego car's navigation system of the upcoming road layout changes to ensure it follows the correct route.\n\nThere is also a green traffic light directly ahead, indicating that the lanes are open for the ego car to proceed; despite this, the ego car should continue to be vigilant for any signal changes or unexpected actions from other road users. On the right side, barricades are present, implying there might be road work or a closed lane ahead, suggesting that the ego car should be ready to change lanes if necessary and be cautious of construction activity that might present obstacles or require taking a detour."

A lane change may be required if the current lane is blocked further ahead due to the construction activity."
