The presence of this vehicle indicates that the lane is occupied, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance by the ego vehicle. If overtaking is needed or desired, a lane change should be considered.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users, including a cyclist moving parallel to the car on the right side of the road and a person dressed in dark clothes walking on the left sidewalk, parallel to the road. The cyclist requires sufficient space and constant monitoring for any changes in direction or speed. Although the pedestrian has not yet entered the road, their proximity to it necessitates vigilance in case they suddenly step onto the road or attempt to cross it.\n\nA traffic sign is present, featuring a yellow sign on an obstacle to the left, displaying Chinese characters that may convey local instructions or warnings. While this sign may hold information relevant to the driver, it is not a regulatory sign that directly influences driving decisions.\n\nThe traffic light ahead displays a red signal, indicating that vehicles should prepare to stop at the intersection.\n\nA series of orange and white traffic cones are arranged along the center of the road, dividing the lanes. These cones signify separation or boundaries that must be respected, possibly indicating roadwork or lane merging ahead.\n\nWhite and blue barriers are placed on both sides of the road, serving to separate pedestrian paths from the vehicle roadway and delineate boundaries for pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nLastly, temporary fencing is noted next to a construction area on the left side of the road. While this may not directly impact driving behavior, it signals the presence of activities or personnel related to construction near the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light ahead, the vehicle should prepare to stop. When decelerating, maintain a safe distance from bicycles on the right and be mindful of parked vehicles that may re-enter the traffic flow. At the same time, ensure that the vehicle stays within the lane marked by traffic cones and barriers. When the green light is on, the vehicle should cautiously proceed, especially considering the presence of bicycles and the potential movements of parked vehicles. Because of the red light ahead, the vehicle should prepare to stop and maintain a safe distance from the red car in the same lane, staying alert to pedestrians close to the road. Moreover, due to the presence of traffic cones on the right, the vehicle should not attempt to change lanes to the right but stay vigilant for possible obstacles or road workers near the traffic cones. Furthermore, because of the traffic cones, the driver should be wary of potential signs indicating lane closure or traffic merging, and prepare to safely adjust the vehicle's driving path.",
