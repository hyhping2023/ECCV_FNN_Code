        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene depicted, there are several notable road users and objects which influence the behavior and navigational decisions of the autonomous driving system.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there's a concrete mixer truck directly ahead on the same path as our vehicle, moving in the same direction. The presence of such a large vehicle affects the safe following distance and speed due to its size and load capacity. It may also obstruct the view ahead for the vehicle following it. Meanwhile, on the left side of the road facing our direction, there are several parked vehicles, including a white van and a sedan. These parked cars limit maneuverability to the left and might hide pedestrians or sudden movements like car doors opening, posing a risk. Additionally, a car is seen approaching from the opposite lane, which restricts our vehicle's ability to overtake by using the opposite lane, emphasizing the need to stay in its own lane.\n\nThere's also a vulnerable road user, a person riding a bicycle on the right edge of our lane, slightly ahead, and dressed in dark clothes. This cyclist impacts traffic flow, necessitating a reduction in speed and maintaining a safe passing distance to prevent potential collisions.\n\nAn installed metal fence on the right side of the road delineates the boundary between the carriageway and the pedestrian area. This barrier lowers the chance of pedestrians accidentally entering the road but also reduces the available space for vehicles, indicating a need for cautious navigation.\n\nIn this scenario, other elements like traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and additional objects are not present, focusing attention on the described vehicles, the cyclist, and the metal fence as key factors in the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from heavy trucks, be aware of vehicles parked on the left, including the narrow passages on the right and the possibility of pedestrians stepping onto the road. When overtaking cyclists, you should keep a safe lateral distance and slow down, taking into account wet road conditions to prevent skidding or loss of control. Do not attempt to overtake trucks until you have clear visibility and safe space. In summary, your vehicle should proceed with caution, monitoring the movements of trucks and cyclists, while also being prepared for any unexpected movements at the roadside.",
