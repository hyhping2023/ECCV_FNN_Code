The ego vehicle should also be ready to proceed as the lights are about to turn green. Additionally, the driver should be aware of the detour sign on the right and anticipate potential changes in road layout, preparing for a lane change if the current lane becomes unavailable due to construction or other reasons. Due to the wet road condition, a cautious approach when accelerating and stopping is required."
