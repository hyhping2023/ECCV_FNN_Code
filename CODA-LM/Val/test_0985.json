Since no pedestrians or cyclists are visible, normal caution should be exercised. Regular scans for any road signs, changes in traffic lights, or unexpected obstacles should be continued. Given the decreased visibility at night and the presence of parked and oncoming vehicles, the ego car should proceed with caution, reduce speed, and maintain a central position in its lane to avoid collision risks. High beam lights should be used judiciously to improve visibility, taking care not to blind oncoming drivers. Vigilance for any movements from parked cars or unexpected road users is also advised."
