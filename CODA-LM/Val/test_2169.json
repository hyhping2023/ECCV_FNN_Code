A black vehicle is seen traveling away from our vehicle's position on the opposite side of the roundabout. It's crucial for our autonomous car to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle and be ready to adjust its speed when necessary.\n2. A yellow construction vehicle is parked on the left side, encroaching the sidewalk and the construction zone. The vehicle is stationary, yet caution must be taken to avoid any unexpected movements when passing by it.\n3. Towards the road ahead and near a fork, there are several vehicles present. Their presence necessitates proactive decisions by our vehicle about which path to take and carefully merging into the traffic.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. Pedestrians are observed walking along the sidewalks adjacent to the road, without impeding the flow of traffic. Nevertheless, our vehicle should remain vigilant and ready to yield or stop if they step onto the road.\n\nBarriers:\n1. A metal fence has been installed in front of the construction equipment on the left, signaling that the area ahead is closed or has restricted access. Drivers may need to seek alternate routes as the fence denotes that the road may be partially or fully blocked.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. A substantial yellow excavator is positioned to the left side in the construction area. While not on the road, its presence could suggest probable sudden movements or increased vehicle activity around the construction site, thereby warranting extra caution.\n\nDespite the abundance of details provided, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights or traffic cones reported in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please drive carefully when entering the roundabout, slow down to deal with possible changes from motorcyclists and the construction zone. Maintain a safe distance from the parked construction vehicles and be prepared for debris on the road that could affect traction. Due to the nearby construction activities, as well as the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians, regularly check mirrors and blind spots. This vehicle should be prepared to exit from the right-side junction, as the left side is under construction. Due to the traffic conditions ahead and possible merging vehicles, slow down as you approach the junction. Pay close attention to pedestrians to ensure they do not enter the lane, and be cautious of potential road debris from the construction site. Considering the construction and parked trucks, this vehicle should reduce speed and remain vigilant. After assessing the traffic rules and conditions, if necessary, consider changing lanes to safely maneuver around the construction area and the parked excavators.",
