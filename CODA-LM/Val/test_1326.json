Pay close attention to whether the concrete mixer truck exhibits any unexpected movement or debris. Exercise caution when overtaking the concrete mixer truck and ensure safety before proceeding; it may be necessary to wait for an appropriate gap in the adjacent lane. Be mindful of obstacles or persons on the right and prepare to respond. When passing cyclists, provide sufficient space, and do not overtake unless there is enough room to do so safely.",

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, is depicted. It is characterized by a large rotating drum used for mixing concrete components. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates possible nearby construction activities. When driving behind such a vehicle, the driver of the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for its larger blind spots and the potential for concrete or debris to fall from the rotating drum. Additionally, these vehicles often make frequent stops and can maneuver unpredictably when approaching a worksite, so caution and readiness to stop or slow down are advised.",
