Its presence is very important because it occupies the lane next to our autonomous vehicle, potentially affecting lane-changing decisions or merging behavior. Additionally, a cement mixer is traveling in the right lane, posing the possibility of obstructed views ahead and influencing following distance and overtaking decisions due to its size and potential slow speed changes.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, a pedestrian is crossing the street on the designated crosswalk. Drivers should exercise caution and be prepared to stop at any time to prevent pedestrians from stepping into the current lane.\n\nThere are white barriers on the right side of the road, separating the pedestrian area from vehicular lanes. These barriers mark the boundary between driving lanes and pedestrian safety zones, which may affect lane positioning and maneuvers around this obstacle.\n\nLastly, there is a trash can in the pedestrian area on the right side. Although not on the road itself, self-driving cars should be mindful of potential pedestrian activity around this object, as it might lead to pedestrians inadvertently stepping into the road."

Currently, there seems to be no immediate need to change lanes, but a high level of situational awareness should be maintained, especially since large vehicles can obstruct the view of the road and potential hazards.",
