The sedan's position indicates it is traveling parallel to the ego car, and the ego car driver should be aware of its presence to anticipate any potential lane changes or impacts on traffic flow.\n\nThere are also triangular yellow warning signs on the right side of the road, indicating a merge and a pedestrian crossing ahead. These signs require the driver to reduce speed and increase attention due to the potential hazards.\n\nTraffic lights ahead are green, signaling that the ego car can proceed if the way is clear. However, the driver should stay alert as the traffic situation can change rapidly."

This vehicle is taking up the majority of the lane it is in and could potentially be moving slower than other vehicles due to the weight and nature of its cargo. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slower movement from this vehicle.

Continuous monitoring of the traffic light is necessary in case it changes. Reduce speed as necessary in response to the warning signs, and remain vigilant for pedestrians and merging traffic. Monitor the sedan in the left lane for any lane-changing behavior that may affect the ego car's path."
