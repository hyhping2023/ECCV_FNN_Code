This requires the ego car to reduce speed and maintain a safe distance. Additionally, multiple vehicles are visible ahead in the same and adjacent left lane, some with taillights on, suggesting a potential traffic situation or slowdown. The ego car must approach with caution, ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary.\n\nAbove the road, there are directional signs indicating the proper lanes for straight and leftward travel, which help ensure the ego car is in the correct lane for its intended route. A yellow diamond-shaped warning sign on the right side of the road indicates a crossing or caution area ahead, alerting the ego vehicle to potential pedestrians or other hazards that may not yet be visible.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light in the red phase is visible above the mixer truck, signaling that traffic in this lane must come to a complete stop, which includes the ego car."
