        "description and explanation": "The image shows two vehicles on a dual carriageway. Directly ahead of our vehicle, in the left lane, is a medium-sized white van, commonly used for deliveries or tradesmen. The position and speed of this van are crucial as they will affect our vehicle's ability to safely accelerate or change lanes. We need to monitor this van closely as it could potentially slow down or change lanes.\n\nIn the right lane, adjacent to the white van, is a large concrete mixer truck. This truck, distinguishable by its specialized equipment, could potentially make sudden stops during its delivery operations. Therefore, our vehicle should maintain a safe distance if considering a lane change. The size and position of this truck limit visibility ahead for our vehicle and may influence the decision to change lanes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image.\n\nA green traffic light is visible ahead. This indicates that our vehicle can proceed but should remain alert for changes in the light or other road users' actions. Our vehicle needs to be prepared to respond to the state of the traffic lights, which could potentially alter the flow of traffic."

Due to its larger size and the fact that such vehicles commonly make frequent stops and have limited maneuverability, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible stops or slow movement from this construction vehicle. Additionally, the ego vehicle should monitor the construction vehicle's signals for any indications of turning or merging that may impact the flow of traffic.",

Due to the heavy presence of a large truck in the right lane, it is advisable to stay in the current lane unless the van ahead slows down significantly or stops. The driver should remain vigilant for any changes in the state of the traffic lights ahead and be prepared to stop if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance from the large truck ahead, monitor its movements for potential lane changes or stops. Keep an eye on the white van on the left and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the van's behavior affects traffic flow. Stay attentive to the green traffic light in case it changes and be ready to stop if necessary."
