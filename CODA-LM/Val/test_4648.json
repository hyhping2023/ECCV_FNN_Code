        "description and explanation": "In the image observed, there are two vehicles noted with specific descriptions and explanations regarding their potential impact on autonomous driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there's a dark-colored car parked on the left side of our car. The concern with this vehicle is not its current stationary state but the unpredictability of sudden movement or the potential hazard of a passenger unexpectedly opening a door close to our lane. This situation necessitates heightened awareness and readiness to respond to avoid any potential accidents.\n\nSecondly, a yellow van is also parked on the left side but is oriented perpendicular to the main vehicle. The positioning and the size of the van pose a challenge as they significantly reduce the available space for maneuvering. This scenario requires careful driving to navigate around the van without causing a collision.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should drive cautiously on the narrow road between the parked yellow van on the left and the dark-colored hatchback on the right, paying attention to the potential road hazards indicated by the traffic cones on the road. Considering the possible slippery road conditions and limited visibility, the vehicle should proceed at a reduced speed and with heightened alertness to ensure safe passage. In such a dimly-lit area, using low beam headlights and hazard warning lights can help improve visibility and alert other road users to the presence of the vehicle.",
