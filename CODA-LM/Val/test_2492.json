There is a large construction vehicle on the right hand side, which is occupying the right lane and extending partially into the ego car's lane, thereby possibly affecting the travel path by necessitating a lane change to keep a safe distance. Ahead in the same lane, several cars are showing tail lights, indicating slow movement or queuing, potentially signifying slow traffic or congestion, which requires careful distance monitoring and potential stoppage by the ego car.\n\nAt a distance, traffic lights are present, but the color state is not currently identifiable, implying that caution must be taken as the ego car advances towards them, requiring readiness for any stopping or proceeding actions depending on the lights' status when closer.\n\nConcrete barriers are located on both sides of the road; to the right, they serve to separate traffic from the construction zone and define the driving path, restricting lateral movement to ensure the ego car does not drift too far to the right. On the left, the barriers indicate road division or construction area, limiting the car's maneuvering space, thereby confining it within its current lane."

It should also keep a safe distance from the concrete barriers and monitor for any possible merging vehicles from the right that might be occluded by the large vehicle. Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle, monitoring its movement for stability and the possibility of parts extending into the ego lane. Be prepared for potential traffic slow down or stops due to the traffic flow ahead. As the state of the traffic light is unclear, approach at a safe speed that allows for a comfortable reaction to the light's state change. Due to the Jersey barrier, remain in the current lane unless a safe and necessary lane change can be confirmed."
