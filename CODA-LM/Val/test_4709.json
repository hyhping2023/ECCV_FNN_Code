        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a white RV occupying the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle. The presence of the RV is important as it determines the following distance and indicates whether the ego vehicle may need to change lanes to overtake.\n\nAdditionally, there are arrow markings on the road that signal a lane merge from three lanes to two lanes. These markings are crucial for the ego vehicle to understand that the lane count is reducing and it may need to merge if it is in the lane that is ending.\n\nFurthermore, there is a continuous concrete barrier on the left side of the road. This barrier serves to separate the lanes from oncoming traffic, limiting the ability to overtake from the left and signifying that the roadway is divided.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in this traffic image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
