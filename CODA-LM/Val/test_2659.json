This truck is currently occupying the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle, and its presence necessitates cautious driving when approaching or overtaking, as it could be preparing to turn, slowing down, or experiencing issues.\n\nAn overhead gantry sign is also present in the scene. However, its content is not visible. Drivers are advised to stay alert to any instructions it might convey, which could be helpful in navigating current or upcoming traffic conditions.\n\nThe scene includes multiple red traffic lights as well. These lights are signaling the ego vehicle and other traffic to stop at the junction they control.\n\nTraffic cones are set up on the right side of the road, indicating either a lane closure or ongoing road work; therefore, it's important for the ego vehicle to be vigilant for potential merging traffic or the presence of road workers.\n\nAdditionally, temporary concrete barriers have been installed to separate the active traffic lanes from a construction zone. These barriers may affect the drivable road width and enforce a clear separation of traffic lanes, which likely influences lane selection and maneuvering for the ego vehicle."

Overtaking should be done with caution, ensuring visibility and clearance, but may currently be unsafe due to the barriers, wet road conditions, and approaching red traffic lights. The ego car should remain vigilant for any additional signs or signals and adjust driving behavior accordingly. Maintain a safe distance behind the truck, prepare to stop due to the red traffic lights, and do not attempt to overtake, as visibility and road conditions may not be optimal. Follow all posted signs and road markings, and stay watchful for road workers. Adjust speed to ensure control of the vehicle on the potentially slippery surface and be ready for any sudden stops or changes in the traffic flow caused by the ongoing road works."
