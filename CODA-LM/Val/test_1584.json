This taxi is stationary, indicating it currently does not pose a direct dynamic danger, but it should be monitored as it may re-enter the traffic flow.\n- A white sedan is traveling in the right lane ahead, moving in the same direction as our car. The behavior of this sedan will influence the autonomous vehicle's speed and following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians:\n- Two pedestrians are walking along the roadside, moving in the same direction as our car. The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from them, and yield until they have safely passed.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop to allow pedestrians to safely cross the road. It is also necessary to monitor parked taxis for any movements that might affect rejoining the flow of traffic. When driving, be careful to navigate around the parked white sedan, ensuring not to enter the opposite lane. Maintain a safe distance from the taxi to have enough space for potential adjustments. Pay attention to the speed of the white sedan and be ready to adjust your speed accordingly. Since the road may be slippery, drive cautiously, increase the following distance between vehicles to have more reaction time.",

For the safe operation of the ego car - the vehicle from whose perspective this image is taken - the presence of a pedestrian necessitates caution and preparedness to slow down or stop if the pedestrian decides to cross the road or steps into the car's travel path.
