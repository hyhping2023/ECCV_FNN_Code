This group includes individuals who are walking along the road as well as those who are standing. The presence of these pedestrians is significant because they may behave unpredictably and could potentially step onto the driving lane, which poses a hidden danger to the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on the right side of the road. It is a circular blue sign with a red border and contains the number \"20,\" which indicates a speed limit of 20 kilometers per hour. This sign is important as it requires the vehicle to slow down to comply with the legal speed limit in that area.\n\nFurthermore, the road is marked by a series of yellow and black traffic cones arranged in a linear formation down the center of the roadway. These traffic cones serve to demarcate the road and typically indicate areas that traffic should not cross. As a result, they guide vehicles to stay in the left lane, ensuring safe passage through the area.\n\nThere are no other vehicles, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "The self-driving car should reduce speed to comply with the speed limit of 20 indicated by the signs. In addition, it must also be prepared to respond to the dynamics of pedestrians, monitoring for any signs that pedestrians may enter the roadway, and be ready to stop when necessary. The presence of traffic cones indicates that the self-driving car should maintain its position in the left lane and must not cross the areas marked by the cones. Remain vigilant for pedestrians near the road and crossing the street, and make a slight adjustment to the left to avoid the traffic cones, while ensuring not to cross into the opposite lane.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It usually is used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, though it is also used in other contexts such as driving training. In this scenario, the traffic cones indicate that the ego car should remain in its lane and not drive through the area marked by the cones. This typically suggests that there might be hazards or road work ahead, and the driver should proceed with caution and awareness for potential changes in the road conditions.",
