This pedestrian is directly in the path of the ego vehicle, posing a potential safety risk that necessitates ensuring appropriate clearance to avoid any accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there are large spools of cable situated on the side of the road, right behind the pedestrian. While these objects are stationary and do not directly interfere with the ego vehicle's path, it's crucial to remain alert to them. This caution is advised in case there are any unforeseen movements or changes in the surrounding environment that could impact driving conditions."

The object does not present an immediate obstacle to the moving vehicle (the ego car) as it is situated outside of the roadway. However, the presence of such industrial items near the driving lane suggests the driver should remain cautious and alert for potential hazards such as nearby workers, equipment entering the road, or vehicles associated with this heavy machinery that may affect traffic flow or present unexpected obstacles.",

If it is safe to do so, the ego vehicle could also steer slightly to the left to create a wider berth while passing the pedestrian, ensuring to not cross into opposing traffic lanes. Maintain current lane position while monitoring the pedestrian's movements. Decrease speed if necessary to ensure safe stopping distance. Be prepared to stop or evade if the pedestrian unexpectedly enters the road. Pass the objects on the side of the road carefully, keeping a watchful eye for any changes in the environment that could pose new hazards. Maintain a cautious speed and monitor the pedestrian closely for any indication of intention to cross the road. Be prepared to stop if the pedestrian enters the vehicle's path. Continue to monitor the road conditions and surroundings for any unexpected changes."
