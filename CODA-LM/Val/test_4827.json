        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several key elements to note that impact driving behavior. Firstly, there is a car parked on the right side of the road. Though these parked vehicles aren't currently obstructing the lane, they pose a potential hazard if a car door were to suddenly open or if a pedestrian were to emerge from beside the vehicle. Additionally, in the distance, multiple vehicles are observed moving in opposite directions on both sides of the road. It's important to monitor the traffic flow and speed to adjust the vehicle's speed accordingly.\n\nAdding to the scene is a small, light-colored dog spotted on the right shoulder, close to the curb. The unpredictable nature of animal behavior warrants close monitoring by the vehicle, prepared to slow down or stop if the dog enters the road.\n\nFinally, the presence of trees and bushes on the right side of the road poses a visibility challenge. These natural elements may obscure potential hazards such as pedestrians or animals suddenly entering the lane. Reduced visibility necessitates careful observation and a reduced speed to adequately respond to any unexpected obstacles.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the available details on vehicles, vulnerable road users, and other objects in the road scene, highlighting the factors that influence driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, watch out for dogs on the shoulder to ensure they don't run into the lane, and drive carefully due to potential visibility issues caused by roadside vegetation. Keep a safe distance from the car in front, stay alert to any changes in traffic flow, and continue to monitor road conditions for any changes or potential hazards.",

It alerts motorists to proceed with caution and potentially prepare to steer away from the designated area. The presence of this traffic cone may indicate that the ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down or change lanes if a part of the road ahead is obstructed or undergoing maintenance.",
