                "description": "A large yellow construction vehicle is on the left lane of a dual carriageway making a right turn into our lane, with its wheels already crossing the lane divider",
                "explanation": "This vehicle is obstructing the left lane and entering our lane, which could cause a collision if our lane's movement is not adjusted. The construction vehicle's size and position may reduce the available lane width for the ego car, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and possibly slow down. This vehicle may be moving slower than the traffic flow and can cause sudden stops or merge into the center lane, which poses a hazard that requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to change lanes if necessary."

                "description": "A red heavy truck is traveling on the right lane of the dual carriageway, ahead of the ego car",
                "explanation": "The relative speed and position of the heavy truck are important for distance-keeping and potential overtaking maneuvers. The presence of the truck indicates that the ego car should monitor the truck's speed and maintain a safe following distance. The truck doesn't currently pose an immediate risk, but the ego vehicle should keep it under observation for any sudden movements or stops given its larger size and lower maneuverability."

Cyclists are less protected and more vulnerable; therefore, the ego vehicle needs to be wary of the cyclist's presence and ensure a safe passing distance is maintained."

                "explanation": "This barrier restricts turning or crossing to the opposite side and dictates that U-turns or left turns must be made at designated gaps or intersections. These barriers dictate that overtaking or lane changes to the left are not possible, and caution should be taken to not get too close to the barriers to maintain a safe lateral distance. Concrete barriers are placed along the center of the two-way road, separating the opposite lanes of traffic. These barriers indicate that crossing or merging into oncoming traffic is not allowed and that the ego vehicle should stay within its lane."

        "description and explanation": "This traffic image depicts a variety of road users and obstacles that affect the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there are multiple vehicles on the road. A large yellow construction vehicle is making a right turn from the left lane into our lane, with its wheels already crossing the lane divider. This vehicle obstructs the left lane and reduces the available lane width for the ego car, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance, possibly slow down, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary due to its slower movement and potential to cause sudden stops. Additionally, a red heavy truck is traveling ahead of the ego car in the right lane. The ego car needs to monitor the truckâ€™s speed and maintain a safe following distance, given the truck's larger size and lower maneuverability, while keeping an eye on it for any sudden movements or stops.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a cyclist is visible on the dedicated bike lane to the right of the carriageway. The cyclist poses a potential risk if they were to swerve or fall, necessitating extra caution when passing by or changing lanes. The ego vehicle needs to ensure a safe passing distance to protect the less protected and more vulnerable cyclist.\n\nAdditionally, a continuous concrete medium barrier divides the opposite lanes of the carriageway, restricting turning or crossing to the opposite side and dictating that U-turns or left turns must be made at designated gaps or intersections. This barrier ensures that the ego vehicle should stay within its lane and not attempt to cross over to oncoming traffic, maintaining a safe lateral distance.\n\nThere are no visible traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in this image."

            "description and explanation": "A mobile crane commonly used for construction purposes is visible. This type of large, heavy-duty vehicle often participates in road work or building projects. Its presence indicates that there may be construction activity nearby, and the ego car should therefore remain alert for potential obstacles, reduced speed limits, or detours due to construction zones. The driver of the ego car should be ready to adjust speed and position to maintain safe driving conditions, particularly since construction vehicles can make sudden movements or stops.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should slow down and prepare to stop or yield to the large construction vehicle making a right turn into our lane. It should maintain a safe following distance from the red heavy truck ahead and exercise caution when passing the cyclist, perhaps by changing lanes to the left if it is safe to do so and the shift doesn't interfere with the construction vehicle's path. Additionally, the ego car should stay aware of its surroundings since no traffic signs or lights are visible to offer further guidance. Given the large construction vehicle's position, the ego car should reduce speed if necessary to ensure safety while passing beside it. It is also crucial to keep an eye on the red truck's movements and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the truck slows down or stops. Continual monitoring of the surroundings for unpredictable events is advised due to the proximity of construction activity. The ego vehicle should monitor the construction vehicle's position and speed, prepare to switch to the right lane if the construction vehicle impedes traffic flow, while also being cautious of the cyclist in the bike lane. Sufficient space should be maintained from the construction vehicle to allow for reaction time, and the truck ahead should also be kept under observation for any unpredictable moves. The ego vehicle should continue to maintain lane discipline due to the concrete center barriers."
