It should monitor the vehicles ahead for any sudden stops or changes in speed and observe the behavior of the pedestrian by the roadside. A lane change to the left may be advisable if it's safe, considering the positions and speeds of other vehicles in that lane. The ego vehicle should also be cautious of the pedestrian by the road, prepared to react should they enter the roadway unexpectedly. Maintaining focus on the road rather than nearby advertisements will ensure that the ego vehicle reacts appropriately to any changes in the traffic scenario."
