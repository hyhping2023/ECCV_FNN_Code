The presence of this large truck limits visibility and may affect the ego car's ability to pass or change lanes safely.\n   - **Blue Sedan**: A blue sedan is visible in the left adjacent lane moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This sedan should be noted for situational awareness and potential lane change considerations.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - **Worker**: A worker in orange attire is on the right side of the ego vehicle, standing near the road while engaged in maintenance work. The worker's proximity to the road could pose a potential hazard if they inadvertently enter the roadway.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - **Speed Limit and No Parking Signs**: On the right side, a speed limit sign indicates a maximum speed of 50 km/h, and a no parking sign is beside it. These signs instruct the ego car to maintain a speed not exceeding 50 km/h and not to park along this section of the road.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - **Traffic Light**: A traffic light is showing a green light for going straight and a red light for turning left. The ego car is allowed to proceed straight but must not turn left as indicated by the traffic light.\n\n5. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - **Traffic Cones**: A series of orange traffic cones are on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating a work zone or lane closure. These cones may signal the need for a lane change if the current lane is closed ahead or narrowing due to the work zone.\n\n6. **Other Objects**:\n   - **Manhole Cover and Barrier**: There is a manhole cover and a manhole barrier right beside the traffic cones. These indicate ongoing road work which could affect traffic flow and require reduced speed for safety."
