These trucks are significant because they may make sudden movements or stops while navigating the construction zone, altering the flow of traffic and potential maneuvers for the ego car. Additionally, their size and position could reduce visibility ahead for the ego car.\n\nThere are two traffic signs visible:\n1. A 'No Parking' sign on the right side of the road. This indicates that vehicles are not allowed to park on the side of the road, which informs the ego car that it should not expect parked vehicles in the immediate vicinity but does not necessitate a change in its driving path.\n2. A blue circular traffic sign on the right side indicating a mandatory turn or continuation of travel in a certain direction. This sign suggests that all vehicles must turn right, indicating a likely upcoming construction detour or a closed road ahead."

Maintaining a safe following distance from the large trucks is crucial due to their unpredictable movement in a potentially changing road environment. The ego vehicle should monitor the behavior of the trucks in case they make any sudden stops or turns and use turn indicators timely to communicate the intention to follow detour. Overtaking should only be done if it's safe and legal. It's important to keep observing the road signage to adhere to road rules."
