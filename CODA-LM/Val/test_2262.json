The brightness of the headlights may cause glare, which poses a potential hazard. It is necessary to monitor the vehicle to ensure it maintains its trajectory within its designated lane to avoid any risk of collision.\n- There are parked vehicles situated on the right side of the road, close to the curb. These parked vehicles reduce the available space on the road for the ego car, and therefore, caution is advisable when maneuvering around them.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- The image analysis indicates that there are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, visible. Even though there is no immediate need to adjust driving behavior to accommodate these users, the ego car should stay vigilant, particular attention should be paid at night when visibility is typically reduced.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- There is a street light observed in the image that is emitting a yellow or orange light. While this light is not a traffic signal and does not influence the driving behavior directly, it does enhance overall visibility in the area.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- A traffic cone is identified on the right side of the ego car. The presence of the cone might suggest upcoming road work or existing obstacles, signaling the need for the ego car to keep a safe distance and consider reducing speed if necessary.\n\nBarriers:\n- A barrier or wall is present on the left side of the road, directly opposite the parked vehicles. This barrier limits the width of the navigable road, necessitating careful driving from the ego car, given the space constraints and the presence of oncoming traffic.\n\nOther categories such as traffic signs and other objects have no entries in this image, indicating there are no relevant elements from these categories to report."
