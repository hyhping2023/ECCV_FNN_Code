This sign likely indicates a construction zone or road work ahead, suggesting potential lane closures, changes in traffic patterns, or the presence of workers and machinery, all of which impact driving behavior.\n\nAdditionally, multiple orange traffic cones are arranged in a pattern that guides traffic to the left, forming a visible barrier. These cones require vehicles to alter their path, likely due to construction or road hazards. \n\nBehind the traffic cones, green barriers are observed, indicating further that a section of the road is closed or restricted. These barriers act as physical obstructions to prevent vehicles from entering the restricted area and help in guiding the traffic flow."
