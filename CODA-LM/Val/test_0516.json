Maintain a lower speed to allow for increased stopping distance due to wet road conditions. Watch for any movement between parked vehicles that may indicate the presence of pedestrians or other road users. Prepare to merge left if necessary, in response to the lane obstruction indicated by traffic cones. Use low beams to increase visibility without blinding oncoming traffic if not already in use, and be vigilant for any road work signage or personnel that may become visible as the vehicle approaches the cones."
