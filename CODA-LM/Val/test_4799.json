This affects autonomous driving as it requires changing lanes to avoid the obstacle and proceed safely. To the right, a person riding a motorcycle is moving in the same direction as our vehicle, which requires extra caution as motorcyclists are less visible and more vulnerable.\n\nAlong the centerline of the road, metal fences are installed to separate the construction area from the passable section of the street. These fences indicate restricted areas where autonomous vehicles are prohibited from entering, designating the safe driving paths within the lanes.\n\nAdditionally, a transparent plastic bag filled with items is visible by the roadside near the self-driven car. This represents a potential danger as unexpected debris on the road could pose a risk if a vehicle tries to swerve suddenly."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and prepare to change lanes to the right in order to safely navigate around construction vehicles, while being mindful of any unexpected movements from parked vehicles or potential road debris. Before merging, it is imperative to continuously monitor the road ahead, oncoming traffic from the left, and motorcyclists. The vehicle should also maintain a safe distance from metal guardrails to avoid accidentally entering the construction zone. The vehicle should be aware of the car in front, keep a safe following distance, and drive carefully past parked vehicles in case they suddenly pull out or open their doors. One should drive at an appropriate speed based on road conditions and not exceed the speed limit, ready to respond to any unexpected events at all times.",

Its presence on the road indicates some construction activity in the vicinity. The ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop if the construction vehicle is merging onto the road or if construction workers are present. It will also need to maintain a safe distance and be vigilant to any unexpected movements or obstructions that may arise from the vehicle's operation.",
