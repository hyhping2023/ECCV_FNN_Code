        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large green truck, characterized by a mixing drum, occupying the right lane slightly ahead of the ego car, with a partial overlap on the right front side of the ego vehicle. Due to the truck's size and its potential to make wide turns, it is a significant factor in the traffic flow and the ego car is advised to keep a safe following distance. There may also be a need for the ego car to change lanes if the truck reduces speed or comes to a halt.\n\nAbove the highway, there are multiple directional signs that span across, providing lane-specific destinations. These signs are critical for the ego car to make informed decisions when taking exits to ensure the correct route is selected for the intended destination.\n\nFurthermore, there are barriers on the left side of the highway creating a division between the current highway lanes and those of the opposite direction, while on the right side, a metallic guardrail acts as a separator between the roadway and the road's edge. These structures enforce a delineated driving area for the autonomous vehicle and prohibit any unintentional crossing into oncoming lanes or off-road areas. All other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects do not have any entries and are therefore not present in the scene."

Pay attention to the overhead directional signs and prepare to take the appropriate lane according to the desired destination. Stay within the designated lanes marked by the barriers and guardrails. The ego vehicle should monitor the position and speed of the green concrete mixer truck ahead, preparing to either slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance. It is recommended to keep a moderate speed due to wet road conditions and to keep an eye on the directional signs to stay on the correct route. A safe following distance should be kept from the mixer truck and other vehicles to account for longer stopping distances on the wet road. Maintain a safe following distance from the green truck, be prepared to react if it changes lanes or slows down. Stay in the current lane unless a change is necessary for the intended route, indicated by the directional signs. Keep an eye out for any traffic lights or signs that might come into view and react accordingly."
