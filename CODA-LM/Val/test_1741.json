        "description and explanation": "The image displays several road users and objects which are critical for an autonomous vehicle's navigation and decision-making processes. In the vehicle category, two three-wheeled vehicles are noted. The first is moving in the same direction as the ego car and has a visually distinct red enclosure with a person in red visible at the back. This vehicle, alongside a second, smaller blue three-wheeled vehicle farther ahead, could necessitate overtaking maneuvers due to their slower speeds, impacting traffic flow and the ego car's trajectory. Additionally, various parked cars along both sides of the road constrict the drivable roadway, necessitating extra caution from the ego car when navigating around potential moving obstacles.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a cyclist on the right side of the road moves in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's proximity to the driving lane and potential to alter direction abruptly requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for sudden stops. Also, a dog crosses the road from left to right, prompting the need for the ego car to prepare for immediate braking or course adjustments due to the unpredictable nature of animals.\n\nLastly, an other objects category features a dustbin located on the sidewalk's edge, adjacent to the parked cars. While not an immediate risk, its presence signals potential obstructions at the road's edge that could restrict maneuvering flexibility, especially when circumnavigating other road users or parked vehicles.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are noted in this scenario, indicating their absence in the visible area of the image. This summary consolidates all relevant information influencing the autonomous vehicleâ€™s driving decisions as derived from the data.\n"

It must also give enough space when passing the cyclist and watch for any sudden movement from the animal near the road. The ego car should keep a lookout for any road users potentially hidden by curves or vehicles ahead and for any other road users entering the road from the periphery. Maintain a moderate speed while following the three-wheeled vehicle and cyclist at a safe distance. Be prepared to brake for the dog crossing the road and watch for any movements from it. Be aware of the reduced road width due to parked cars and shadows from trees that may affect visibility. Overtaking the slow-moving vehicles should be done with caution only when there is clear visibility ahead and no oncoming traffic."
