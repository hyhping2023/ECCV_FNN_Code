Cyclists are vulnerable road users and could potentially become an obstacle if they swerve or fall into the roadway. The presence of a cyclist requires heightened caution from the ego car."

Concrete and metal barrier on the right side of the road, separating the construction site from the road, defines the edge of the drivable roadway and limits the space for maneuvering if necessary, highlighting the importance of staying within the lane boundaries."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present. However, there is one motorcyclist on the right side of the road who is traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The motorcyclist is wearing a dark jacket and helmet. This individual is noteworthy due to their proximity to the ego car's driving lane, which poses a potential risk should they choose to change lanes suddenly or encounter an obstacle. Being a vulnerable road user, the motorcyclist could become an unexpected obstacle in the event of a swerve or fall, necessitating increased vigilance on the part of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers established on both sides of the road. These barriers are crucial as they clearly demarcate the edges of the road and limit the space available for lateral maneuvers. It's important for the ego car to maintain its position well within the lane boundaries to avoid any contact with the barriers. This is especially true for the barrier on the right side of the road, which also serves to separate a construction site from the roadway, further emphasizing the limited room available for the ego car to navigate safely."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed due to maintenance work or an accident. For the driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of this cone indicates there may be potential hazards or changes in the driving path ahead. The driver should remain alert, reduce speed if necessary, and be prepared to adjust the vehicle's trajectory or to follow any detour signs or instructions.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the motorcyclist ahead, and be prepared to react if the motorcyclist decides to change lanes or if any other road users unexpectedly enter the road. As there are barriers on both sides, ensure that the vehicle stays within the lane markings and make no abrupt lane changes that could endanger the motorcyclist. Monitor the motorcyclist's behavior for indications of their intentions, such as turn signals or shoulder checks. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance and speed while passing the cyclist, and continuously monitor the behavior of the cyclist to anticipate any potential movements into the travel lane. Stay within the lane markings due to the nearby barriers and absence of immediate obstructions on the road."
