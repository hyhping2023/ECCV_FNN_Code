Additionally, a white car directly ahead in the left lane could impact the autonomous vehicle's speed and lane choice.\n\nNo vulnerable road users are present in the image, so no action is required for pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists.\n\nSeveral traffic signs are visible, including a blue circular sign indicating the need to drive on the right side of the road, warning signs with exclamation marks that alert the vehicle to be cautious, a prohibition sign for vehicles over 14 tons, a road construction ahead sign advising careful driving, a \"40\" speed limit sign that the vehicle must adhere to, and directional signs that inform about lane usage and potential turns or exits.\n\nThere are no traffic lights present in the image.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the right to separate the construction area from the drivable lanes, guiding drivers to stay within designated lanes and alerting them to potential road workers or machinery. Additionally, orange and white traffic cones form a barrier between the far left lane and the middle lane, indicating that lane changes are not allowed and possibly signaling ongoing construction or road work.\n\nTemporary yellow barriers are set up to separate the traffic lane from the construction site on the right, providing a clear physical boundary for the driving path to prevent the vehicle from entering dangerous areas.\n\nOther objects include a metal fence on the right, which might demarcate a pedestrian area or the boundary of a construction site, and a protective debris fence installed on the right side of the road, used to contain debris and signal road construction or maintenance activities."

    "driving_suggestion": "While maintaining lane discipline, one should always be prepared to adapt to changes in traffic conditions, especially those caused by construction and possible road work. Pay attention to traffic signals and obey speed limits. Since different signs indicate road construction and the specific directions that must be followed, staying alert and ready to change lanes is crucial to ensure a safe distance from vehicles ahead and in adjacent lanes.
