        "description and explanation": "The image contains several vehicles, vulnerable road users, and other objects. \n\nThere are three vehicles in the image. A silver sedan is parked by the roadside, facing away from our car. It poses no immediate threat, but we should be cautious of potential activity around it, such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging from behind. A gray compact car is parked in front of the sedan, and we should monitor it for any sudden activity. A white van is parked on the right side, with its rear door facing our vehicle. Its size may obstruct our view of pedestrians or other hazards, so we should be extra vigilant when passing by.\n\nTwo vulnerable road users are present. A pedestrian is moving from left to right, crossing indistinctly in front of our car. This poses a safety hazard as their path may intersect with ours. Another pedestrian, possibly male, is on the right side of the road, having passed behind the white van from our vehicle. Pedestrians can be unpredictable, so it's important to maintain a safe distance and be ready to respond to any sudden changes in their movement.\n\nThere are also several other objects in the image. On the right side, there's a pole attached to public facilities. It doesn't encroach on the road and shouldn't affect our vehicle. A billboard or information sign is located on the right support. While it doesn't pose a direct danger, it's a static element by the roadside that requires attention. Lastly, a bicycle is locked to a post on the sidewalk, near the gray compact car. While there are no cyclists currently, it serves as a reminder to be cautious of potential cyclists in the area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the parked vehicles and pedestrian activity, autonomous vehicles should maintain a moderate speed and drive as close to the center or left side of the road as possible to ensure a safe passing distance from parked vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers should slow down and be prepared to stop, giving priority to pedestrians crossing the street, and pay close attention to other pedestrians that may follow, especially when passing white vans. Although no direct threat has been observed, it is necessary to remain constantly vigilant to prevent car doors from suddenly opening or pedestrians inadvertently entering the road. Additionally, always be ready to react to any sudden changes in the behavior of any road users. Drive defensively and anticipate potential hazards.",
