        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, we see a variety of elements on the street that the ego car needs to navigate through. On the right side of the street, several cars are parked in parallel to the curb, which narrows the drivable width of the lane and could lead to potential hazards such as occluded pedestrians. Occupying the same lane ahead of the ego vehicle is a green taxi. The autonomous system in place must ensure to keep a safe following distance and be ready to respond to the taxi's actions.\n\nAhead, the traffic light visible to the vehicle is showing red, requiring the vehicle to come to a complete halt to comply with traffic laws and maintain road safety. On the right side, in front of the parked vehicles, traffic cones have been arranged, suggesting a warning for potential road work or dangers ahead and requiring the vehicle to maintain a clear berth.\n\nAn obstacle, which might be part of a structure or a temporary barrier, can be seen on the sidewalk to the right. While this doesn't directly affect the car's trajectory, it could be hiding pedestrians from view, which is an important consideration for the autonomous driving system.\n\nOn the surface of the road, there is a noticeable reflection that implies recent rainfall, making the road wet and likely slippery. This condition demands that the car's autonomous system accounts for decreased tire traction and longer braking distances, and must adapt its driving strategy accordingly. It is essential for the vehicle to exercise increased caution under such conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the autonomous vehicle's path is affected by stationary parked cars, the movements of a taxi directly ahead, traffic guidance objects such as traffic lights and cones, and environmental aspects like wet roads. Each of these factors must be taken into account by the autonomous driving system to ensure a safe and law-compliant journey."

    "driving_suggestion": "Up ahead is a red light, and the driving car should prepare to stop. Considering the road surface reflection and the parked vehicles, it is recommended to slow down to cope with the potential reduction in traction. Meanwhile, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and be vigilant for any hazards hidden by the changing traffic flow due to parked cars or traffic cones. Drive cautiously and keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Continuously monitor parked motorcycles for any movements into the lane. Be prepared to react to pedestrians who may be obscured by parked vehicles or obstacles. Since the traffic light status is unclear, follow the flow of traffic and pay attention to any other traffic control devices or signs. If weather conditions are unstable, adjust speed and driving behavior adaptively to prevent possible slippery roads.",
