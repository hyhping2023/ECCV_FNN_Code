        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a red forklift on the left side ahead at an intersection, with its forks lowered, appearing to be stationary or moving slowly. The forklift could potentially enter the ego vehicle's lane or obstruct traffic, so the ego car needs to be ready to slow down or stop. Nearby, a construction worker is visible near the forklift, on the left side of the ego vehicle, wearing high-visibility clothing. The worker's presence suggests construction activity, and the ego vehicle should be cautious and prepared to stop or slow down for any potential hazards. Additionally, there is at least one visible operator on the forklift who might disembark or maneuver the vehicle, indicating the potential for unpredictable movements that the ego car must be ready to respond to.\n\nThe traffic light in the image is green, which means the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed through the intersection, but it must still consider the forklift activity. On the right side of the road, there are green and blue construction barriers, signaling potential road work or changes in traffic patterns. These barriers indicate that the ego car should be cautious of possible roadwork ahead, possibly reduce speed, and stay alert for any construction vehicles or workers that might affect traffic flow."

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy-duty industrial vehicle commonly used in construction, identifiable by its sturdy build and the lifting apparatus visible at its front. Typically, such vehicles are used for transporting or maneuvering large materials on construction sites. In the context of driving behavior, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from this construction vehicle, as it can make sudden movements or stops, may have a wider turning radius, and visibility for the operator might be limited, affecting their ability to see smaller vehicles. Consequently, the ego car should be attentive and ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid interference with the operation of the construction vehicle and ensure safety on the road.",

Continue to monitor the traffic light and be prepared to adhere to it if it changes. Be aware of the barriers indicating potential construction activity which might affect the driving lane and road conditions ahead. Pay special attention to the construction area on the left and the adjacent worker. Maintain a safe distance from the barriers and be prepared for any potential changes in the road conditions. Reduce speed and be prepared to stop if the forklift enters the roadway. Be aware of the construction zone to the right and watch for any signs of workers or other vehicles that may affect the roadway. Although the traffic light is green, prioritize the safety of all road users and the current road situation over the traffic signal."
