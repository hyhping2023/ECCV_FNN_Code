This construction vehicle's presence is significant due to its slow speed and considerable size, which affect the ego vehicle's capacity to maintain normal traveling speeds or execute a passing maneuver safely.\n\nAdditionally, the roadway is bounded by green mesh fencing on the left side and a solid wall on the right side. These barriers play a critical role in dictating the ego vehicle's available movement options, effectively confining it to the lane it currently occupies and preventing any lateral maneuvers that could typically be used to bypass an obstruction or slow-moving vehicle ahead."

It is typically used for various tasks on construction sites, such as hauling materials or assisting with earthmoving duties. Its presence on the road signals a potential construction zone nearby. Future driving behavior for the ego car would involve cautious driving, keeping a safe distance, and being prepared for any sudden stops or changes in the construction vehicle's movement. The driver should be aware of the possibility of additional construction vehicles or workers in the vicinity.",

Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, being prepared to brake or slow down due to its potential slow movement. Do not attempt to overtake unless the road ahead becomes clear and it is safe to do so. Monitor the construction area for any additional obstacles or road users that may enter the roadway unexpectedly. If the construction vehicle is stationary and road works are present, the ego car may need to wait for a signal to pass or find an alternative route if available."
