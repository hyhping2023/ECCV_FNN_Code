        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles present on the road. The first is a yellow van parked on the right side of the road, facing the ego vehicle and partially obstructing the lane. This vehicle necessitates caution as it reduces the available width of the driving lane, potentially requiring the ego car to slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance. Following the yellow van, there is a white van parked on the same side of the road, also facing the ego vehicle. This white van, similar to the yellow one, contributes to the lane obstruction and could affect the ego vehicle's path planning. Further ahead, there is a white van followed by another white vehicle on the right side of the road. The distance between these vehicles is uncertain due to visibility conditions. The presence of these vehicles suggests that there may be slow-moving or stationary traffic ahead, and the ego vehicle should be prepared to reduce speed or stop if necessary. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution at a reduced speed to allow for safe passing of parked vehicles. The reduced visibility due to poor lighting conditions demands increased vigilance for dynamic road users who could be obscured by darkness. The ego car should be prepared to stop or maneuver safely if a pedestrian or another vehicle unexpectedly enters the roadway. Use of headlights and possibly high beams, if appropriate, will improve visibility. Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles as they may present sudden hazards such as opening doors or unexpected departure. Due to the parked vehicles and low visibility, it is recommended that the ego car should slow down, turn on its headlights if not already on, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary while ensuring it is safe to do so. Caution should be exercised due to the lack of visible traffic signs and road markings."
