This excavator presents a potential hazard as its position could be dangerous to passing vehicles, particularly if it moves or any part of it inadvertently extends into the road.\n\nAdditionally, there are no visible traffic signs in the immediate vicinity, which implies that the autonomous driving system should rely on standard road rules and be cautious of any evident hazards in the environment.\n\nFurthermore, a line of orange traffic cones is placed to the left of the dirt road. These cones are used to signal a no-entry or caution area, possibly due to construction or a closed-off section. As a result, the autonomous vehicle is advised to stay to the right side of the cones, steering clear of the restricted area signified by the cones. No other objects, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers were identified in the image."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a heavy construction vehicle, specifically an excavator. It is a piece of machinery commonly used for digging and moving large amounts of material, such as soil or rock. This vehicle is equipped with a boom, a stick, and a bucket attached to a rotating platform known as the 'house.' In the context of driving, encountering such a vehicle indicates that there could be road construction or land development activities nearby. The vehicle's presence may also suggest potential hazards such as nearby construction workers, uneven road surfaces, or unexpected obstructions. Since the excavator is stationary and positioned to the side of the road, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, be prepared for construction signage or signals, and be vigilant of the surrounding environment to react accordingly to any changes.",

The vehicle should stay to the right side of the cones, avoiding the area to the left which is likely a construction or no-driving zone. Since the road is unpaved with potential hazards like loose gravel, the driver should be prepared for uneven terrain ahead and operate at reduced speeds to maintain control and safety."
