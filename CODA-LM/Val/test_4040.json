        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a red car positioned ahead of the ego vehicle on the left front, which exhibits brake lights that could imply traffic congestion or an obstruction ahead, prompting the ego car to be ready to decelerate or come to a stop. Adjacent to the ego car, on the right front, partially visible is a white vehicle in motion. It is crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from the white vehicle because it poses a risk for unexpected stops or turns. Also noticeable is a vehicle that resembles a bus on the right side; although it's less visible, the shape and illumination from its advertisement suggest a larger vehicle requiring the ego car to maintain distance and anticipate potential stops. Moreover, there seems to be reflective materials on the right, which could be road signs or other reflective objects. The reflection has been exacerbated due to glare which may be a result of wet road conditions or other light sources, leading to decreased visibility. Consequently, this requires careful driving and increased attention to the surroundings to avoid missing crucial signage or information. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
