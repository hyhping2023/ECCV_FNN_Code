The taxi demands attention; it could potentially stop to pick up or drop off passengers, execute turns, or initiate lane changesâ€”all of which require the ego vehicle to be vigilant and responsive to ensure safety.\n\nMoreover, a vulnerable road user scenario unfolds as a pedestrian, trailed closely by a dog, crosses the street from right to left in front of the ego vehicle. Since they are using the crosswalk, they hold the right of way. Their trajectory across the road significantly affects the ego vehicle's potential actions, as it must wait for them to cross safely before proceeding.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, the scene lacks any visible indicators that would directly affect the driving conditions. In such cases, the ego vehicle must depend on other cues like traffic lights and roadways' demarcations to make informed decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights present in the distance are displaying a red light for lanes facing the ego vehicle's direction. This red signal necessitates that the ego vehicle prepare to halt at the upcoming intersection, or if it's already at the intersection, to remain stationary until the light changes.\n\nNotably absent from the scene are traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects, such as debris or bins, that might pose unforeseen hazards. The absence of these elements allows the ego vehicle to concentrate on its interaction with the aforementioned road users and the traffic light without additional distractions."
