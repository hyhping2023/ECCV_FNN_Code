The truck has its brake lights on, suggesting that it may be slowing down or at a standstill. Consequently, the ego car must keep a safe distance and be ready to stop if necessary to adjust to the truck's actions.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow diamond-shaped warning sign is placed on the right side of the road, signaling drivers to be alert due to potential hazards that could be present further down the road. Drivers are advised to continue with caution in response to this sign.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic scenario includes multiple traffic cones arranged in a line, encroaching into the ego car's lane from the right. This indicates that the driving lane ahead may be tapering, likely as a result of road works. The ego car should prepare to alter its path to navigate the upcoming change in lane conditions safely."
