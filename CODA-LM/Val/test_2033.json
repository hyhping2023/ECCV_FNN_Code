Keeping a safe distance is important to allow for safe stopping and to respond to the heavy vehicles' actions.

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several notable elements impacting the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle (ego vehicle). Firstly, there are two significant vehicle observations: A large mobile crane mounted on a yellow carrier truck is diagonally positioned across the lane to the right of the ego car. Its boom extends towards the back of the truck, indicating a potential encroachment into the ego vehicle's lane, necessitating vigilance and a possible lane change. Thereâ€™s also a collection of heavy vehicles ahead, moving in the same direction as the ego car, including a prominent red truck in the center lane. These heavy vehicles' presence and slower speed may influence the ego car's lane choice and speed, emphasizing the need for a safe stopping distance and readiness to adapt to traffic flow and stops.\n\nAdditionally, a blank overhead gantry sign is observed with no visible instructions, which typically wouldn't directly affect driving decisions. However, the presence of such signage could suggest an approaching junction or interchange, requiring alertness to upcoming road changes.\n\nMoreover, temporary construction barriers are noted along the right side of the road, starting near the mobile crane truck and extending forward. These barriers are indicative of a potential construction zone, which may result in reduced road width and necessitate the ego vehicle to maintain its lane and possibly decrease speed. Such barriers highlight ongoing construction work that could lead to narrowed or closed lanes, requiring careful attention to any shifts in traffic patterns.\n\nIn this traffic scenario, the lack of traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects and vulnerable road users simplifies the driving environment to some extent but underscores the importance of remaining alert to vehicle movements and roadwork."

            "description and explanation": "A heavy-duty vehicle equipped with a crane arm, commonly referred to as a construction vehicle. This type of vehicle is used for tasks such as lifting and moving materials on construction sites. When encountered on the road, it can indicate nearby construction activity. The presence of such a vehicle in close proximity to the driving lane suggests that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slowdowns in traffic flow due to construction work or the vehicle's movements.",

Considering the construction barriers on the right, it should not attempt to overtake the crane truck on that side. If lane changing is required for a faster route or to maintain speed, it should be done with caution, ensuring ample space and signaling clearly ahead of any maneuvers. Monitor the situation for any further developments that could require a reduction in speed or complete stop. Maintain a cautious speed and be prepared to make a lane change if the situation around the crane truck deteriorates or impedes the original lane. Increase following distance from the flatbed truck, and keep an eye out for any other lane blockages or changes due to the construction area indicated by the barriers. Continue observing the behavior of other vehicles closely for signs of sudden stops or lane shifts."
