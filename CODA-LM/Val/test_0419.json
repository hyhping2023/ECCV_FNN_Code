These vehicles are integral to the traffic flow and dictate the driving speed and potential maneuvers of the ego car. Additionally, there is a vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, its presence indicated by headlights. This oncoming traffic necessitates that the ego car maintains its lane and remains vigilant against potential glare impairing visibility.\n\nAlthough the image does not show any pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, their absence means they do not currently influence the driving decisions of the ego car. Similarly, there are no visible traffic signs that could provide instructions or restrictions for the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\nThe absence of traffic lights in the field of view implies that the ego car must navigate based on other road indicators and rules. However, there is a line of traffic cones to the right of the ego car, marking the boundary of the driving lane and suggesting the presence of a road hazard or construction zone, which guides the ego car to remain within the designated lane. Beyond the traffic cones, there is a curb or barrier on the right side, delineating the road from adjacent non-driving areas and requiring the ego car to keep a safe distance to avoid contact.\n\nLastly, the driving surface is clear of debris, dustbins, or other objects, indicating that there are no obstructions that would necessitate evasive maneuvers by the ego car."

Regularly check mirrors for any vulnerable road users entering the road from blind spots, especially in areas where there may not be pedestrian sidewalks clearly visible."
