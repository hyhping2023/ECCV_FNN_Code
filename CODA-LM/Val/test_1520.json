However, it does display several traffic signs. One is a speed limit sign that indicates a maximum speed of 5 km/h, applicable to the parking lot or driveway entry near the road, which mandates the ego car to adhere to this speed restriction for safety and compliance. Additionally, there is a no parking sign to the right of the road, alerting the ego car that it is prohibited from stopping or parking in that area in accordance with traffic rules.\n\nEven though there are no traffic lights or traffic cones present in the image, barriers are visible. Concrete barriers are located on the left side of the road, serving as a separation of lanes or to demarcate a closed-off section, necessitating the ego car to stay on the right and avoid entering the protected area. There are also yellow and black low barriers in front of the ego car, which serve to separate lanes and guide vehicles to remain within the designated driving lanes.\n\nAmong other objects, two large green waste bins are situated on the right side of the road just before a turn. These waste bins could potentially obscure the driver's visibility around the corner; thus, the ego car must proceed with caution to ensure a clear path without hidden pedestrians or hazards."
