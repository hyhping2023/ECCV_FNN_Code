        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large construction vehicle, possibly an asphalt paver, directly in the ego car's lane. Its size and the likelihood of slow movement mean that the ego car will need to keep a safe distance or consider a lane change to avoid disruption to the traffic flow. Surrounding the ego car, there are various passenger cars and vans in adjacent lanes, both aligned and staggered in position. These vehicles present a risk of merging into the ego car's lane, necessitating vigilance and potential speed or lane adjustments for safety.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is visible above the construction vehicle, signaling that traffic is allowed to proceed. The ego car should continue moving forward but remain cautious of signal changes and the actions of the construction vehicle and other road users.\n\nTo the left of the ego car, there is a median barrier that separates the opposing traffic flows, indicating that it is not possible to overtake or switch to the opposite lane from the current lane of the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."

Given its size and purpose, it is likely to be slower moving and may make frequent stops or sudden movements as it operates near construction sites. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for the possibility of the construction vehicle stopping or turning without much warning, and exercise caution when attempting to overtake it, ensuring there is enough clear space to do so safely.",

Be prepared to change lanes if it becomes safe and necessary to pass the construction vehicle. Pay attention to the behavior of vehicles in adjacent lanes for potential merges and adjust speed accordingly. Due to the wet road conditions, increase following distances and be cautious when braking or changing lanes to prevent skidding or loss of control."
