It is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle since it might be carrying heavy loads, and its movements can be less predictable. Additionally, such vehicles often make sudden stops or movements related to construction sites. Maintaining a cautious approach and being prepared for possible stops or slow-downs is recommended.",

Monitor the cement truck's movements closely and increase the distance from it in case it attempts to merge or change position. Continue to scan the road for any changes in traffic conditions. Due to limited visibility of the traffic light signals and the presence of large vehicles, the ego car should approach the intersection with caution ready to stop if the traffic light is red. If visibility is severely compromised due to sun glare at the traffic lights, it may be wise to slow down and prepare to stop unless the lights are clearly green. With the traffic light currently green, the ego car should proceed with caution and be aware of the state of the traffic light changing as it approaches the intersection."
