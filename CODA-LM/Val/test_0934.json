The first is a red truck parked on the right side of the road, partially obscured by trees. This truck is not an immediate obstacle but should be monitored for any unexpected movements. The second set comprises cars parked on the left side of the road in a designated parking area. These parked cars pose a low hazard but require the ego car to maintain its lane position to avoid potential door openings or pedestrians moving around them.\n\nA \"No entry\" sign for vehicles is located to the left of the road, attached to a barricade. This sign indicates that vehicles are not allowed to enter the area to the left, likely due to roadwork or restrictions.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are placed ahead on the right side, guiding traffic away from a work site. These cones indicate a temporary change in traffic flow that must be followed for safe navigation around the work zone.\n\nMetallic temporary fencing is installed along the right side of the road, enclosing a construction area. These barriers suggest construction work on the right, which may affect the road's width and necessitates slower speeds and increased vigilance.\n\nLastly, there is a row of trees lining the left side of the street, providing partial obstruction of the view. These trees may obscure the view ahead, particularly of any road users emerging from between the parked cars or the construction zone."
