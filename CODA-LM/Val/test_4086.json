Keep a safe distance from the cyclist and be prepared for potential traffic disruptions caused by the operational vehicles on the right. Continuously monitor the surrounding environment for any unforeseen changes, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary, while ensuring a safe passing distance from the cyclist. Maintain a safe distance from the sedan in front, be prepared to adjust speed or stop if necessary, and monitor the construction zone on the right for potential hazards. Additionally, the car should keep a watchful eye on the cyclist to the left and adjust the lane position or speed to ensure the safety of all road users. Staying alert and ready to react to construction workers or sudden movements of the construction vehicles is crucial. If the current lane becomes obstructed due to the construction, the ego car should safely change lanes following traffic rules and signals. Drive at reduced speeds to safely navigate the road conditions, especially given the wet road surface, and be prepared for a reduced reaction window and potential stopping delays. Maintain awareness of pedestrians and be prepared for unexpected movements."
