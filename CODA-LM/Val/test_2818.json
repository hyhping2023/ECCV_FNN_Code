However, there is a cat sitting in the middle of the road, which appears to be stationary or possibly moving slowly. The presence of the cat is significant as it can lead to unpredictable reactions from other road users, who may need to stop or swerve suddenly to avoid harming the animal. Consequently, the ego car must be ready to decelerate or come to a complete stop to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes residential entryways and utility poles on both sides of the street. These elements indicate that the environment is residential, which suggests that the ego car should be cautious of potential hazards such as doors opening suddenly or pedestrians stepping onto the road unexpectedly."
