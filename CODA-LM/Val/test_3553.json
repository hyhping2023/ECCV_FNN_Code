The presence of this vehicle is significant as it could potentially slow down or execute unpredictable maneuvers, which the self-driving car must be prepared to respond to. Additionally, the size of the commercial vehicle may obstruct the view ahead for the autonomous car, making it more challenging to anticipate road conditions and react accordingly.\n\nAlongside the road, there are concrete or stone barriers situated on the right side, delineating the boundary between the roadway and the sidewalk or adjacent areas. These barriers are crucial for the autonomous vehicle to recognize as they mark the limits of the navigable road space, ensuring that the vehicle remains within the designated driving area."

When encountering a merge sign ahead, if necessary, prepare to adjust your speed or change lanes, ensuring safety by checking rearview mirrors and blind spots before proceeding.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, characterized by its large cylindrical mixing drum. This type of vehicle is often used for transporting and mixing concrete in construction settings. Given the presence of this vehicle on the road, the driver of the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movements, as construction vehicles can make unexpected maneuvers associated with construction activities. Additionally, because concrete mixers are heavy and have large blind spots, it is important to avoid lingering in those blind spots and to exercise caution when overtaking.",
