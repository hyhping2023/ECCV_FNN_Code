It is placed on a transport truck, indicating that it is not operational at the moment but is being moved to or from a worksite. The presence of this type of vehicle on a transport truck requires the ego car's driver to maintain a safe following distance due to the typically slower acceleration and deceleration times of heavy-duty transport vehicles, as well as the potential for abrupt stops or reduced visibility around them.",
