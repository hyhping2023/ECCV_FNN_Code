Several passenger vehicles are on the road ahead, including a white car in the same lane as the ego vehicle but at a safe distance. These cars are part of the normal traffic flow, and their movements should be monitored for sudden stops or lane changes that might impact the ego vehicle's driving decisions.

Multiple traffic cones are also positioned on the right, indicating that the right-hand lane is closed or obstructed. Thus, the ego car should stay in or merge to the left lane to avoid the closed lane ahead."

The wet road conditions also call for increased following distance and lower speeds to account for decreased traction. Continuous monitoring of the situation ahead and being prepared to stop if traffic conditions require is advised."
