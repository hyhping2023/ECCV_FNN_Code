        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, we have several notable road users and objects which impact the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle. Firstly, there are two vehicles in the scene. One is a black car positioned in the left lane ahead, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The presence of this vehicle requires our autonomous system to monitor its own location and movements carefully to maintain a safe following distance. Secondly, a large yellow construction vehicle is fully occupying the right lane, found directly in front of our vehicle. This construction vehicle is obstructing the road and may be moving slower than the normal flow of traffic, necessitating a lane change for our autonomous vehicle to preserve its speed and adhere to its intended route.\n\nIn addition to vehicles, there's a traffic sign of interest. A blue directional sign is placed above the right side of the road, indicating an upcoming exit or direction shift. For autonomous vehicles, recognizing and understanding the instruction provided by this sign is crucial in order to navigate correctly based on their predetermined routes.\n\nNotably, no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, are present in this scene. Similarly, there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could potentially influence autonomous driving decisions in this particular observation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the black car ahead, monitor the construction vehicles on the right to determine if they might be conducting roadwork or lane closures, and prepare to navigate according to the directional signs. Adjust driving speed appropriately according to road conditions and stay alert to traffic pattern changes that might result from the construction vehicles. The autonomous vehicle should be ready to change lanes to the left to avoid slowing down due to the construction vehicles ahead. At the same time, it is also necessary to monitor the behavior of the black car to ensure a safe lane change, considering its speed and trajectory to avoid cutting in too close. The autonomous vehicle should signal early and check mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, which appears to be a heavy piece of machinery such as a backhoe loader or an excavator used for construction work. It is equipped with a digging arm and a bucket attachment. The presence of this vehicle on or near the road suggests construction work in progress, which could result in possible obstructions or detours on the route. The ego car should be aware of potential changes in traffic patterns, reduced lanes, or the presence of construction workers, and should therefore proceed with caution, reduce speed, and be prepared to follow any temporary traffic signs or signals.",

Trucks of this size often have restricted maneuverability and may accelerate or brake more slowly than smaller vehicles. Drivers should keep a safe following distance behind such vehicles to avoid potential hazards from sudden stops or debris falling from the truck's load. They should also be cautious when overtaking, ensuring they have ample space and visibility to pass safely.",
