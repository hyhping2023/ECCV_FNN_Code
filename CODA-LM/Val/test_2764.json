It is partially extending into the lane, necessitating careful navigation by the ego car to move around it.\n\nAdditionally, there are two pedestrians walking along the right side of the road, facing away from the ego vehicle. The proximity of these pedestrians to the roadway could pose a potential risk as they might enter the driving lane, therefore, it is important for the ego car to proceed with caution and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nFinally, there is a crane operation underway on the right side of the road but positioned away from the driving lanes. While it doesn't seem to be an immediate concern for the road itself, maintaining situational awareness is vital in case of unexpected movements or falling debris due to the operation."

Additionally, the presence of construction equipment implies a work zone ahead, so the ego car should proceed with increased caution, adhering to any posted speed limits or construction signs that may be ahead. Maintain a cautious speed while passing the parked trucks, giving them a wide berth in case of unexpected movement. Be prepared to stop or slow down if the pedestrians show any indication of moving towards the driving lane. Keep an eye on the crane operation and be ready for potential instructions from work zone traffic controllers, or the appearance of temporary traffic signs. Continue monitoring the road ahead for any new developments. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the parked vehicles and the pedestrians. Be prepared to slow down or stop if the pedestrians veer into the driving lane. The crane should be monitored for any unexpected activity. Carefully navigate around the flatbed semi-trailer extending into the lane, checking the mirrors and blind spots for safe passage. Drive at a speed that allows for adequate reaction time to any potential hazards."
