There are various cars parked on both sides of the street which limit the usable road width and may conceal potential hazards such as pedestrians. A white car is traveling in the same direction but in a different lane to the left of the ego car, and its actions should be monitored for any impact on the ego carâ€™s lane-changing decisions. Additionally, a police vehicle is observed on the right side, further ahead, with active red and blue lights, which could imply a nearby incident where the ego car may need to yield or stop.\n\nVulnerable road users include a motorcyclist riding in the same direction in an adjacent lane to the right of the ego car, requiring constant monitoring to ensure safety and to predict any movements. There is also a pedestrian with a dog on the right crosswalk ahead, which could influence the timing of when the ego car can continue forward.\n\nThe only traffic light in view is green above the ego car's lane, signaling that it may proceed while staying alert for any changes in signal or unexpected moves from surrounding road users.\n\nLastly, other objects such as trees, streetlights, and utility poles are present along the roadside. These objects are typical for an urban setting and do not actively influence the driving behavior, though they should be passively observed for any potential changes or emerging hazards."
