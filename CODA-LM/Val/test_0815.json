At the forefront, two motorcyclists are stationary in the lanes ahead, with one directly in the same lane as the ego vehicle and the other to the right. Their stationary position with red tail lights on indicates that the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop or proceed when possible.\n\nFurther ahead, at an intersection, two vehicles are also stationary, waiting for the traffic lights to change. The ego vehicle must be ready to respond to their movements and the traffic signal, as these vehicles control the flow of traffic at the intersection.\n\nAlthough no vulnerable road users like pedestrians or cyclists are present in the scene, the ego vehicle should stay alert for any that may appear.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a 'No Stopping' or 'No Parking' sign, informing the ego vehicle that stopping or parking in that area is not permitted.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is green, indicating that the vehicles have the right to proceed through the intersection. The ego vehicle can prepare to move forward when it is safe, taking into account the stationary motorcycles in front.\n\nThere is a barrier on the right side of the road, part of a gated area or construction zone. It does not directly affect the driving path but serves as a reminder to stay in the marked lanes and be cautious of potential road condition changes or unexpected obstacles.\n\nLastly, the visibility is reduced due to a large amount of particle matter in the air, which could be raindrops or a dirty windshield. This requires the ego vehicle to exercise extra caution and possibly reduce speed."
