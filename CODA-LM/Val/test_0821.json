        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a black car parked on the right side of the road, facing away from our vehicle. Though stationary, the car's presence requires caution as it reduces the available driving space, raising concerns for unexpected movements like the car's doors opening or the vehicle pulling out.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic cone with reflective stripes on the left side of the road, accompanied by warning signs. This setup indicates a potential hazard or construction zone ahead, prompting the vehicle to remain on the right and possibly reduce speed as a precaution.\n\nA temporary barrier or sign is also present on the left side, partially obstructing the lane. The barrier suggests that the road might be closed or rerouted, which means that the vehicle should be prepared to decelerate, come to a halt, or navigate a detour if necessary.\n\nLastly, there is a utility pole on the left with numerous cables that could be hazardous if they come too close to the traveling path. Hence, drivers should keep a safe distance from such poles to avoid dangers, particularly when the road becomes less visible or narrows down."

The driver should maintain a safe distance from vehicles stopped on the right and be vigilant for work zones or changes in road conditions ahead. Moreover, the vehicle should check for any indications to change lanes due to temporary obstacles and be ready to follow such instructions. While ensuring alertness to the possibility of parked vehicles moving, keep within the lane. If applicable, be prepared to follow directions indicated by traffic signs and do not enter areas blocked by obstacles. Monitor the road width that may be affected by utility poles and ensure driving within the road boundaries.",
