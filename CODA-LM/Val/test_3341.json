        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles present. The first is a large truck occupying the lane directly in front of the ego vehicle. It is noticeable for signs of wear and could potentially lose debris from its load. The truck is either stopped or moving at a low speed, which directly impacts the ego vehicle's ability to continue driving unhindered. It is essential for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for any sudden stops or falling debris from the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a smaller vehicle in the lane to the right of the ego car. This vehicle can be identified by its illuminated tail lights and is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of this vehicle is important in the context of the ego car's lane-changing decisions or when moderating its speed to ensure safe driving practices. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that need to be considered."

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial vehicle, commonly referred to as a truck, is present. It is recognized by its size and the container or cargo area at the back. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from this truck to ensure there is ample space to react to any sudden stops or turns the truck may make. Additionally, the ego car's driver should be cautious when considering overtaking, as trucks have larger blind spots and may not easily notice smaller vehicles.",

Be prepared for sudden stops and adjust lane position to maximize visibility ahead, if safe to do so. Monitor surroundings for any changes and be ready to take evasive action if debris falls off the truck. Monitor the smaller vehicle to the right to avoid any potential blind spots in case a lane change becomes necessary."
