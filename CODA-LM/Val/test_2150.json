        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a large crane truck in the left lane driving ahead of our vehicle. It is notable for its extended load that goes beyond the truck bed, and it is equipped with clear safety signs and warning lights. The presence of this crane truck is significant because its size and payload can affect its driving dynamics, such as acceleration and braking, which means that following it too closely could be dangerous.\n\nAdditionally, a white van is traveling in the middle lane, slightly ahead of our vehicle, and moving in the same direction. The behavior of this van, including potential lane changes or speed adjustments, must be considered by autonomous vehicles to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nIn the distance, there are several vehicles visible across all three lanes, traveling in the same direction as our car. The flow and behavior of these vehicles will impact the driving decisions of our vehicle, such as when to adjust speed and which lane to choose.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a metal fence set up, separating the road from the sidewalk and adjacent properties. This barrier is important as it defines the available road width for our vehicle and prevents any deviation to the right off the road.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance to prevent accidents with the large crane truck ahead that may have overlength loads and could stop suddenly. Be mindful of the behavior of the white van and prepare to adjust your speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid following too closely. Pay attention to the metal guardrails on the right that limit road width and reduce overtaking options. Given the dry road conditions and smooth traffic flow, this vehicle can continue to travel at a safe speed in accordance with traffic rules and adjust accordingly based on the overall traffic situation.",

            "description and explanation": "The image shows a large, yellow construction vehicle with multiple sections, including a boom, suggesting it may be a mobile crane. This vehicle is considerably larger and heavier than the standard passenger cars, which indicates that it will likely move slower and may have limited maneuverability. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for unexpected stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle. Additionally, careful attention should be given to the construction vehicle's turn signals and brake lights to anticipate any turns or stops it may make.",
