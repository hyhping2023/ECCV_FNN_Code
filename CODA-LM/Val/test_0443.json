Consequently, the ego car should be ready to slow down or come to a stop. There are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, in the immediate vicinity, which reduces the risk of sudden stops or maneuvers to avoid them.\n\nAn illuminated directional sign above the road indicates an approaching junction or off-ramp, informing the ego vehicle that it may need to change lanes or prepare to exit soon. There are no traffic lights in view, which means that immediate driving decisions won't be influenced by traffic signals, but caution is advised if nearing an intersection.\n\nTraffic cones are arranged in an arrow shape pointing left, signaling a lane closure or diversion and directing the ego car to merge to the left. A large construction vehicle is parked partially in the travel lane to the right of the ego car, with a barrier visible ahead of it, indicating ongoing road work. This requires the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, there is potential construction debris or materials on the right side of the road near the construction vehicle. This could pose a hazard, and the ego car might need to maintain a safe distance or change lanes to avoid it."
