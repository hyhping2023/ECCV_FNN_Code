        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a large specialized truck with an articulated arm directly ahead of the ego car. It is taking up part of the lane and partially blocking the view of the road ahead. The truck's rear lights are illuminated, suggesting that it may be slowing down or has come to a stop. This vehicle could present a hazard due to its large size and the potential for unexpected work-related movements or stops. Accordingly, the ego car may need to decelerate or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance and navigate around the truck without incident.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light situated to the right of the industrial truck, which governs the lane the ego car is in. The green signal grants the ego car the permission to continue, but caution is advised owing to the partially obscured view and the potential for the truck to carry out unforeseen maneuvers.\n\nFurther observations show faint reflections on the road surface, indicating possible wet or slick conditions. These conditions may affect vehicle control and lengthen the distance required to come to a full stop. As a result, it would be wise for the ego vehicle to modify its speed to ensure safe travel in light of the altered road surface conditions."

If there is an adjacent lane that is clear, the ego car should signal, check mirrors and blind spots and change lanes when it's safe to do so, taking into account the road surface conditions. If there is no opportunity to change lanes, the ego car must come to a safe stop behind the industrial vehicle, maintaining a safe following distance. Continue to observe the traffic light-if it remains green and the lane to pass the truck is clear, the ego car may proceed with caution. If the traffic light changes, the ego car should follow the standard traffic rules for the signal."
