        "description and explanation": "In front of us, a large construction truck is in the same lane as our autonomous vehicle, equipped with various attachments and possibly shedding debris like dirt. The substantial size of this truck may obscure our view, and the falling debris presents a potential hazard that could damage our vehicle or disrupt driving stability, hence it's important to keep a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a black SUV in the lane to our left, traveling slightly ahead and side by side with us. The SUV's close proximity requires careful consideration for any lane-changing maneuvers or speed adjustments we may need to make to ensure safe driving and to accommodate for the SUV's position relative to our vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "A heavy construction vehicle designed for tasks such as digging, lifting, and moving materials. Due to its size, operation pattern, and potential cargo, close proximity to this vehicle could pose a risk of debris or material falling onto the roadway or onto nearby vehicles. It appears to be in operation or transporting materials. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance, be alert for sudden stops or turns by the construction vehicle, and be prepared for the possibility of debris on the road. The construction vehicle's presence may indicate nearby road work, requiring additional vigilance and adherence to changed traffic patterns or reduced speed limits.",

Be cautious about the SUV's position in the left lane before considering changing lanes; ensure it is safe by checking mirrors and blind spots, and using turn signals. Prepare to change lane if the situation ahead deteriorates or if overtaking becomes necessary and safe. Continue monitoring the road ahead for changes in traffic condition or unexpected obstacles."
