        "description and explanation": "The image presents a dynamic road scene encompassing various elements that influence autonomous driving behavior. At the forefront, a large green articulated truck occupies a significant portion of the road ahead, spanning multiple lanes while executing a right turn. The size and positioning of the truck pose a direct challenge to navigation, necessitating increased caution and precise maneuvering to ensure safe passage around this obstacle. Adjacent to the truck, on its left side, a motorcyclist is observed traveling parallel to our vehicle. Given their vulnerability and lesser visibility, especially in comparison to larger vehicles, it's imperative to maintain a respectful distance and remain vigilant of any potential changes in their speed or trajectory to avoid accidents.\n\nAccompanying these road users, a traffic sign is noticeable, explicitly prohibiting left turns. This directive mandates that vehicles, including ours, must proceed straight ahead, aligning with traffic regulations and ensuring the smooth flow of vehicles. On another note, the road scene is devoid of any traffic lights and traffic cones, indicating no immediate alterations in traffic flow or temporary constructions influencing the current driving conditions.\n\nMoreover, an obstacle or possibly a guard booth is positioned to the right of the scene, delineating the extent of navigable road space and potentially serving as a checkpoint. This structure inherently restricts the width of the drivable area, guiding autonomous driving systems to adhere strictly to lane disciplines.\n\nIn absence of further objects such as traffic cones or miscellaneous obstructions, the scene primarily demands attention to the aforementioned road users and infrastructure cues to formulate an appropriate and safe driving strategy."

    "driving_suggestion": "Autonomous vehicles should remain stationary until the large truck has completed its turn and the road is clear. When passing through intersections, it is crucial to pay attention to motorcyclists and maintain a safe following distance. The self-driving car should also be mindful of obstacles on the right to stay in the correct lane. Prepare to drive cautiously, adhere to right-of-way rules, and watch for any additional signals or signs that may not be visible in this image.",
