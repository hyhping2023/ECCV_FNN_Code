        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present. However, there is a notable traffic sign, specifically a fluorescent green sign on the left side of the road. This sign appears to indicate an interesting location or facility, potentially influencing the route decision for the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the image features traffic cones in two distinct arrangements. The first set of traffic cones is placed diagonally on the left side of the road, delineating the lane boundary. This setup suggests there might be a lane closure or a detour ahead, necessitating cautious driving and strict adherence to lane discipline. The second set comprises green and white traffic cones set up on the right side of the road to guide traffic away from the roadside. These markers are directing the flow of traffic and may reduce the drivable area, requiring self-driving cars to stay within the designated lanes.\n\nFurthermore, plastic modular barriers are arranged in rows along both sides of the lane. These barriers delineate the driving path and isolate the lanes from each other, guiding the path of self-driving vehicles and limiting their ability to change lanes. This requires drivers to remain within the designated lane.\n\nNo traffic lights or other objects are mentioned in the image, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the driving conditions depicted."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive cautiously, obey the speed limit, stay within the marked lanes, while also paying attention to all road signs and traffic signals. Since the traffic light is green, the vehicle can continue to proceed. Be vigilant for any potential lane changes due to road construction or lane closures indicated by traffic cones. Stay to the right to avoid any obstacles, and maintain a safe speed according to road conditions and applicable speed limits. Prepare to slow down as you approach a pedestrian crosswalk ahead. If navigation decisions are needed, consider the route guidance that may be displayed on green signs.",

In this instance, it is positioned to indicate a deviation or an obstruction in the road ahead. The ego vehicle will need to acknowledge the traffic cone by reducing speed if necessary and steering to avoid it, ensuring a safe passage through the altered lane arrangement without entering prohibited areas.",

The cone is usually orange and made of a flexible material with a reflective stripe to enhance visibility. When driving, the presence of a traffic cone suggests that the driver should stay clear of the designated area, potentially indicating roadwork ahead, an obstacle, or a change in the normal traffic pattern. The ego car should prepare to slow down, move away from the cone, and proceed with caution to ensure safety.",
