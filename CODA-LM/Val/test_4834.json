Additionally, there are two pedestrians wearing brightly colored clothes, one adult and one child, walking on the sidewalk to the right of the ego vehicle. Pedestrians near the roadway could potentially enter the driving path, requiring the ego vehicle to monitor them and be prepared to stop. There is also one person sitting at a roadside vendor stand on the right, facing away from the road. The person is occupied and stationary, posing minimal direct risk, but awareness should be maintained.\n\nFurthermore, orange and white traffic barriers are lining across the right side of the road next to the cargo truck, creating a physical boundary. These barriers indicate a construction zone or road closure on the right, guiding vehicles to stay within the available lane(s) to the left. Metal barricades are also present alongside the traffic barrier cones, further emphasizing the road boundary. Together with the cones, these barricades provide a clear visual indicator to not cross into the restricted area.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."
