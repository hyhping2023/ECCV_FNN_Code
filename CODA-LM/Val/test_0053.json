A white bus is directly in front of the ego car in the same lane, partially occluding the view ahead. The bus may make sudden stops to pick up or drop off passengers, affecting the following distance and speed the ego car must maintain.\n2. A black car is positioned diagonally to the right in the next lane, ahead of the ego car, which may indicate an intent to change lanes or an upcoming maneuver. The black car's actions must be anticipated in case it decides to merge into the ego car's lane, requiring appropriate spacing and potential speed adjustments.\n3. A silver car is in front of the ego car traveling in the same direction. This car dictates the following distance and potential for slowing down or stopping, which directly affects the ego car's speed and need to maintain a safe following distance.\n4. A silver SUV is to the left of the ego car in the adjacent lane, traveling in the same direction. The SUV's presence means the ego vehicle should be vigilant about the SUV's movements, particularly if it decides to change lanes.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. Directional signs on the right side of the road indicate a curve ahead, with arrows pointing to the left. These signs indicate the road layout which the ego car needs to follow in order to stay in the lane while navigating the curve.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. Traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, channeling traffic away from that side and towards the left. The cones are indicating a potential road hazard or construction area, requiring vehicles to adjust their path to maintain safety.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. A yellow and black arrow sign on a barrier indicating that the lane is closed and directing traffic to the left. This barrier informs drivers, including the ego car, that they must merge left due to a lane closure ahead.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n1. A yellow sign with black chevrons is placed in the center median, indicating a leftward direction of the travel lanes. This sign is meant to guide vehicles through the altered traffic pattern and to indicate the direction of the safe navigable roadway.\n2. A temporary barrier sign with a directional arrow is placed on the road, directly in the path of the ego car, indicating a shift in the travel lane to the left. This barrier sign is serving as a directive for vehicles to move to the left to avoid an obstacle or roadwork."
