        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several key elements affecting the dynamics and safety of autonomous driving. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there's a black car parked on the left side of the road, facing away from our car. Its stationary position suggests caution is necessary, as unexpected movements like opening doors or pedestrians appearing from behind it could occur. Ahead, on the right, a silver sedan is seen driving in the same direction as us, necessitating continuous monitoring for any sudden speed changes or lane switches to adjust driving strategies accordingly. Additionally, a white vehicle is parked near a garbage station on the right side, potentially blocking the view and posing risks from unexpectedly disembarking passengers. Itâ€™s also noted that various vehicles on the oncoming lane, although farther away, require observation to maintain heightened alertness as part of the general traffic flow.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian wearing a red jacket walking alongside the road in the same direction as our movement, on the left edge. The proximity to the road poses a risk as they might suddenly step onto the roadway, necessitating readiness to slow down or fully stop.\n\nAside from moving entities, the scene includes several power poles and a garbage station booth aligned along the roadside. These are static and part of the regular road infrastructure, typically not affecting driving behavior unless an unusual activity occurs near them, such as individuals entering or exiting the garbage area.\n\nThis description of the scene provides a comprehensive overview of immediate and potential influences on autonomous driving decisions, highlighting the necessity of considering both mobile and immobile elements within the driving environment."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the current traffic conditions, this vehicle should proceed with caution, especially being mindful of pedestrians by the roadside. It is necessary to reduce speed accordingly and be prepared to come to a stop where pedestrian paths intersect with our vehicle's route. Furthermore, maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead is vital, as well as staying alert for dogs in the middle of the road in case they suddenly come to a halt. Additionally, be wary of potential hazards from cars parked on the left side. This vehicle should also slow down to keep a safe distance from the dog, remain vigilant of motorcyclists, and watch for any indication that the pedestrian wearing a red jacket may enter the roadway. Meanwhile, keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front, ready to react to any car doors that might suddenly open near garbage disposal areas. Do not attempt to overtake until it is clear that the dog has safely departed and the lane is free of bicycles and pedestrians. Slow down and be prepared to stop for pedestrians crossing the street. Stay alert to the movements of motorcyclists and dogs, and be mindful of stationary vehicles-lane changing might be necessary if it cannot be ensured that passage will remain safe. Always be ready to navigate around unexpected obstacles while adhering to traffic regulations.",
