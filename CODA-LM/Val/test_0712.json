This situation requires the ego car to be cautious and ready to slow down or stop. Directly in front of the ego car is a white sedan, positioned in the center of the road and appearing to be stationary with its brake lights illuminated. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this sedan and be prepared to stop.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign indicating parking options, including 24-hour payment, monthly payment, and temporary parking. While this sign provides information about parking availability, it does not directly impact the driving behavior unless the ego car is seeking a parking spot.\n\nOn the side of the road, metal barriers are present, marking the boundary between the road and the sidewalk. These barriers guide the ego car to stay within the driving lane and prevent it from driving onto the sidewalk.\n\nLastly, there is construction equipment, such as a mobile crane, visible off to the right side of the image. It is located beyond the barriers and parked vehicles, occupying part of the sidewalk and potentially part of the road. This suggests that there may be roadwork or obstructions nearby, which could lead to unexpected slowdowns, road blockages, or the presence of workers in the area. The ego car should be alert to these potential hazards."
