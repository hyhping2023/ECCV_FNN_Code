        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large truck situated directly in front of the autonomous vehicle, sharing the same lane. This truck is clearly seen with its brake lights activated, signaling that it is slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation necessitates attention from the autonomous vehicle as it directly impacts the vehicle's decision-making. The close proximity of the truck in the same lane as the autonomous vehicle limits its ability to proceed without adjustments. This scenario requires the autonomous car to either decelerate to maintain a safe following distance or to consider changing lanes if it's safe, to avoid potential hazards or to keep the traffic flowing smoothly. This is the sole road user category present in the image, with no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data provided."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large commercial vehicle commonly used for transport of goods and materials. It possesses a sizable cargo area that is typically open at the back or covered by a fabric that can be rolled up. The truck's physical dimensions, weight, and movement can significantly influence the road conditions and traffic around it. As the truck occupies a considerable amount of space on the road, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential changes in the truck's speed or direction. Ensuring a safe following distance also provides the ego car driver with better visibility of the road ahead. The truck's maneuvers, such as turning or changing lanes, require additional caution from surrounding vehicles due to its size and blind spots.",

Since it is nighttime, reduce speed to enhance safety margins given the reduced visibility. Monitor surrounding lanes for an opportunity to change lanes safely if necessary to maintain the flow of traffic. The ego car should monitor the truck's brake lights and indicators to anticipate any change in the truck's behavior. If the truck starts to move or if an opportunity arises to pass the truck safely, the ego car can proceed with caution, considering the lane markings and the rules of the road."
