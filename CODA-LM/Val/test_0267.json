The presence of the taxi could influence the speed and lane choice of the ego car due to its position and movement. Additionally, there is a red car in the opposing traffic lane, facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle. The ego car should be attentive to the opposing traffic flow to anticipate any unexpected maneuvers such as sudden lane changes or stops.\n\nThere are multiple cyclists on both sides of the street, some within the lanes and others at the edge of the road, facing various directions. The proximity of the cyclists to the ego car's travel path may affect the car's lane positioning and speed to ensure a safe passing distance. Pedestrians are present on the sidewalks on both sides of the road, with some close to the curb, which may suggest the potential for crossing the street. The ego car must watch these pedestrians to prevent any unexpected entry into the roadway and to yield to those in the crossing area.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is located on the right side of the road, signaling the possibility of a pedestrian crossing ahead. This requires the ego car to be ready to yield or stop if necessary.\n\nLastly, there are trees lining both sides of the road, which provide partial shade. Although they do not directly impact driving behavior, the shadows they cast could affect the visibility of road users and traffic signs.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
