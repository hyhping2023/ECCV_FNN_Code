This requires the ego vehicle's driver to be cautious as the motorcyclist might make unexpected maneuvers or come to a sudden stop. On the right, there is a work zone where workers are standing inside a protected area adjacent to the ego car's lane, which necessitates a slower speed and readiness for potential incursions into the driving lane.\n\nAlthough traffic lights are visible in the distance, itâ€™s not possible to discern their current state from the image. The ego vehicle should be prepared to alter its driving based on the traffic lights' status upon approach. Lined up along the construction zone's edge are orange and white traffic cones, indicating that there might be road closures ahead for construction, calling for lower speeds and heightened alertness to avoid potential hazards. White barriers with reflective stripes mark the perimeter of the work zone near these cones, providing a clear demarcation of a no-go area for vehicles and hinting at a road section that may be closed or restricted, thus guiding the ego vehicle away from the workers' space.\n\nFurthermore, workers in orange uniforms can be seen within the construction zone on the roadway's right side, which means the ego vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to halt if needed to ensure safety."
