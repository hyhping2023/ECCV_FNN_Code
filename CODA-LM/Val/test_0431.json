This van is reducing the passable width of the driving lane and creates a potential hazard due to the risk of pedestrians stepping into the road. Additionally, there's a blue truck on the opposite side of the road, partially visible and facing the ego car, which could obstruct the road if it were to move or if unloading activities were to commence.\n\nIn the category of vulnerable road users, there is a person engaged in what appears to be construction or repair work on the right side of the road, close to traffic cones and barriers. The presence of this worker suggests that road work may be ahead, and there is a possibility that the individual could enter the road unexpectedly. On the left sidewalk, there are motorbikes parked, implying the possible presence of motorcyclists who may also enter the roadway without warning.\n\nFor the traffic management items, there are multiple traffic cones organized around what seems like a construction or repair site on the right, leading to lane restrictions and the channeling of vehicles away from the work zone. Moreover, barriers comprising traffic cones and caution tape are set up around a construction area on the right side of the road, demarcating it as a no-entry zone and visually signaling drivers to steer clear of this area due to ongoing works.\n\nLastly, under other objects, various motorcycles and bicycles are parked on the side of the road, potentially limiting the space available for maneuvering and affecting drivers' ability to see clearly. Also, there are accumulations of building materials and debris near the construction site on the right, presenting a risk of causing obstructions if these materials were to scatter or spill onto the roadway.\n\nThe scene calls for cautious and alert driving due to the various elements present that could impact the normal flow of traffic and pose risks to the safe operation of the ego car."
