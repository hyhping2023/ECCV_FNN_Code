It is important to maintain a safe following distance, considering the size and potential for sudden braking or loss of cargo from the truck. The size and position of the cargo truck suggest that maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to brake or steer to avoid collision is necessary, especially if it makes unexpected maneuvers."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are two significant vehicles in proximity to the ego car that are worth noting. Firstly, there is a large mixer truck positioned on the left side, adjacent to the ego car, and it is moving in the same direction. The substantial size and the position of the mixer truck could potentially impact the lateral clearance and the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car. This scenario necessitates cautious driving practices due to the possibility of the mixer truck making abrupt stops or slowing down, which could require the ego vehicle to decrease its speed or change lanes to maintain safety.\n\nSecondly, directly in front of the ego car, there is a cargo truck moving in the same direction. This truck is distinguishable by its red body, which is covered with a tarpaulin, and its considerable size. The presence of this cargo truck directly ahead plays a critical role in setting the driving pace for the ego car. It underscores the importance of the ego car maintaining a safe following distance to account for the truck's size and the potential for sudden braking or unexpected loss of cargo. The scenario highlights the need for the driver of the ego car to be vigilant and prepared to brake or steer to avoid a possible collision, particularly if the cargo truck performs unexpected maneuvers.\n\nNo other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the traffic scene, indicating their absence or lack of relevance to the driving behavior of the ego car in this particular scenario."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, is present on the road. Its unique rotating drum is designed to mix cement while in transit. Given the vehicle's size and the nature of its cargo, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to allow for adequate reaction time if the construction vehicle slows down or stops unexpectedly. Additionally, the ego car should be alert for potential debris or spillage from the mixer's drum, which could affect traction and visibility on the road.",

Be attentive to the mixer truck on the left to ensure sufficient lateral space and avoid being in its blind spot. Keep in the lane and monitor the rear-view and side mirrors for additional road users. Prepare to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, when it is safe to do so. Continue to observe for any additional road users not currently visible that may influence driving decisions. Do not attempt to overtake unless a clear and safe opportunity presents itself, particularly given the size and potential blind spots of such vehicles. Stay alert for any changes in the road situation that may require immediate action."
