Ahead in the same lane, there are multiple vehicles, including a white SUV closest to the ego car, followed by a silver sedan and several other vehicles in stationary or slow-moving traffic, indicating a potential traffic jam. These vehicles directly influence the ego car as they occupy the same lane. Additionally, cars in the adjacent left lane also appear to be in slow-moving traffic, necessitating monitoring as they could change lanes unexpectedly. There is also a gray vehicle moving in the opposite direction in the adjacent left lane, which should be monitored but does not directly influence immediate decisions.\n\nTraffic cones are placed along the edge of the right lane a few car lengths ahead, suggesting a road hazard or construction work, necessitating a lane merge to the left if safe. Concrete barriers are situated to the right of the ego car, demarcating the roadway boundaries and emphasizing the need to stay within the marked lanes. Lastly, there are items such as bags or debris on the side of the road to the left, which, although not in the ego car's path, pose potential unexpected hazards that should be considered."

Continuous monitoring of the surrounding vehicles and any potential road hazards, such as the items on the side, should be maintained. Any maneuvers should be executed with consideration of the reduced traction and the presence of other vehicles."
