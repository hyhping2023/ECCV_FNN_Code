This vehicle's large size and potential stops for construction deliveries necessitate a safe following distance from the ego car. Adjacent to the right of the ego vehicle, various cars are traveling in the same direction. Particularly, a white car ahead of the construction vehicle could influence the ego vehicle's driving decisions with possible lane changes or adjustments. Additionally, a white sedan is in the lane to the left of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead and also moving in the same direction, requiring attention for possible sudden lane shifts.\n\nAbove the road are green illuminated directional signs, essential for navigating upcoming routes, signaling information regarding lane directions. In the distance, a green traffic light is visible above the rightmost lane, indicating that vehicles can proceed. However, vigilance must be maintained for any change in the traffic light, which could affect the stopping distances and behaviors of other drivers. A separate set of traffic lights shows a red signal affecting lanes other than the one the ego car occupies, potentially influencing nearby drivers to change lanes in order to avoid stopping.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

This vehicle is often larger and heavier than typical road vehicles and may require additional space to maneuver. The presence of such a vehicle suggests that there may be ongoing construction or road work nearby.

As the traffic light is currently green, the ego vehicle can proceed but should remain prepared for traffic conditions to change, especially if the traffic light switches. Maintaining a moderate speed and vigilance is advised to react safely to the dynamic urban driving environment. Since the road is wet, reduce speed appropriately to ensure safety. Keep monitoring the green traffic light ahead for any changes, and be prepared to stop if it transitions to yellow or red. Since it is night and visibility might be limited, increase alertness to all road users and changing conditions."
