This setup has blocked the road, and moving the vehicle could pose potential dangers.\n   - A white car is ahead in the right lane, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Its position and behavior will influence our car's speed and following distance.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - On the right side of the road, there is a sign related to construction ahead, typically indicating a change in the normal traffic pattern, which may necessitate a detour or to proceed with caution.\n   - Another sign on the right side indicates that the right lane ahead is closed due to construction. If our vehicle is in this lane, a lane change will be necessary.\n   - There is also a directional sign visible on the right side before the intersection, suggesting a detour or alternative route, likely due to road construction.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light for going straight and the left-turn signal are both red, necessitating a complete stop if proceeding straight or turning left.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Brightly colored traffic cones are placed around the construction area, guiding the flow of traffic around it and marking zones where personal vehicles are prohibited from entering.\n   - Orange traffic cones placed around the construction area on the right indicate that the lane is closed, guiding traffic flow and reminding drivers to avoid the closed lane.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n   - Temporary fences/barriers are erected around the construction site and between the construction vehicles and traffic cones. These barriers prevent personnel from entering and serve as visual signals to indicate a change of route.\n\n6. **Other Objects**:\n   - There is a mobile electronic arrow board on the right side, directing traffic to merge left due to the lane closure. This arrow provides an additional visual cue, reinforcing the instructions of the traffic sign."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to reduced visibility at night and possible dynamic changes in the construction area, cautious driving is required. The main vehicle should not proceed straight or turn left until the red light turns green and the construction area is clear or an alternative route is determined. If intending to continue straight, the main vehicle should prepare to slow down and stop while following the red light. Because the right lane is closed, it is necessary to merge into the left lane before the intersection. The presence of construction vehicles and traffic cones requires extra alertness, as there may be workers and machinery operating. Exercise caution when approaching the intersection due to construction activities. Since the traffic light on the right is green, if the main vehicle's intended direction aligns with the open lane, it should continue driving while respecting any detours or traffic flow changes indicated. It is important to stay vigilant against sudden movements of construction vehicles or changes in traffic patterns around the construction zone.",
