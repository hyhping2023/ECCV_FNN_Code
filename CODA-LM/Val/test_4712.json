        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are multiple road users and objects that impact driving decisions for an autonomous vehicle.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a white truck in the same lane ahead, which is moving away. It is essential for our vehicle to keep an eye on this truck for any speed changes or lane-switching movements and to maintain a safe distance behind it. Additionally, a blue and white taxi is parked on the left side of the road, and its driver is standing close by. The autonomous vehicle should be cautious around the taxi, as it may unexpectedly start moving or someone might open its doors, creating a hazard for passing traffic.\n\nVulnerable road users include a pedestrian who is walking along the sidewalk's edge and might cross the road or interact with parked vehicles. This presents a risk, and our vehicle must be watchful of the pedestrian's actions. Furthermore, a cyclist is on the right side, somewhat hidden by roadside objects, with their back to our vehicle's direction which requires attention. The vehicle must keep a lookout for the cyclist's potential movement into the driving lane, which could necessitate a route adjustment.\n\nLastly, there are various objects that also need consideration. Sidewalk vendors and parked motorcycles on the right side could limit the available road space and potentially cause pedestrians or other vehicles to move unexpectedly into the roadway. Therefore, our vehicle should reduce speed and proceed with caution to respond safely to any sudden obstructions or pedestrians that may emerge into the flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "If the blue vehicle making a turn impedes the driving route, this vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the turning vehicle and the white truck parked on its right side. The driver should stay alert for pedestrians who may enter the road from the vendor area and pay attention to pedestrians carrying blue boxes who might accidentally step onto the road. Maintain a moderate speed and be ready to respond to the busy urban environment at any time. Extra caution is needed when passing parked taxis and motorcycles, as car doors may open or pedestrians may suddenly step into the lane. Keep a safe speed to react to pedestrian movements and regularly check the rearview mirrors in case parked vehicles or pedestrians on the road suddenly step into the street. Currently, there is no immediate action required for traffic signs and signals, but stay vigilant to respond to any changes in road conditions and the actions of other road users ahead.",
