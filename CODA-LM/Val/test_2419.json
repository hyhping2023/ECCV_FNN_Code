The first is a partially visible white car on the front right, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle, which necessitates keeping a safe distance and speed. The second is a blue car seen from the rear on the left side of the frame, slightly ahead and also moving in the same direction. The blue car's presence means our vehicle needs to monitor its trajectory to prevent a side collision and be ready for any potential lane changes it might attempt.\n\nAlthough no pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic signs, lights, cones, or barriers are present in the scene, there are large rolls of cable stored on the right side of the road. These require attention because they could roll onto the road and impact visibility or road conditions."

While these spools are typically stationary and found in industrial settings, in the context of driving they are an unusual object to encounter on or near the roadway. The presence of such an object suggests that the ego car should maintain caution, reduce speed if necessary, and be alert to potential road work or obstructions nearby. As the spools are positioned off the road, they should not have a direct impact on the immediate driving path of the ego car unless they become an obstacle on the road.",
