The truck has rear lights on indicating its presence, and a license plate is visible.",

This truck's size and the potential for slow movement or sudden stops directly influence the safe following distance the ego car must maintain."

The size and behavior of the truck, such as its slower acceleration and deceleration, impact the driving decisions of the ego car.

It is distinguished by its large rotating drum used for mixing concrete components. The presence of this vehicle indicates that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance due to potential hazards associated with construction vehicles, such as sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle.

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck, as its size could make sudden stops or changes in driving behavior less predictable. The ego car should monitor the traffic lights and proceed while the signal is green, but be prepared to adjust speed if the truck ahead reacts to something the sensors can't detect. The ego car should also stay alert for potential overtaking opportunities if it needs to eventually pass the concrete mixer truck, ensuring the maneuver is conducted safely and within traffic laws. Observe the truck's behavior for signs of turning or stopping, and prepare to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Monitor the traffic lights as the ego car approaches the intersection, being ready for the possibility of the lights changing. Maintain a safe following distance behind the construction vehicle and prepare to stop for the red traffic lights ahead. The ego car should not attempt to pass the construction vehicle until it is safe to do so and should also obey traffic signals as it approaches the intersection."
