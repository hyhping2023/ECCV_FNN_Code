        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there is a large yellow truck on the right side of the road. It is positioned diagonally, encroaching into the right lane, with the truck's rear end closer to the ego vehicle than the front end. This truck is causing an obstruction due to what appears to be maintenance or construction work and may necessitate a lane change or at least a reduction in speed from the ego vehicle.\n\nClose to the truck, construction workers are present, indicating an active work zone. They can be seen near the truck and behind the orange traffic cones, moving around which could potentially be hazardous. The ego vehicle should exercise caution and reduce speed to avoid any unexpected incidents as the workers might enter the roadway without warning.\n\nA traffic sign is visible in the image; it's a blue, round sign with white arrows pointing straight up and to the right. This indicates that vehicles in this lane have the option to continue straight or turn right, and the ego vehicle should be ready to make this choice depending on its intended route.\n\nScattered on the road, orange and white traffic cones, paired with a white and red horizontal barrier, are set up to delineate the work zone from the usable lane. They indicate that part of the right lane is closed off for maintenance, signaling to vehicles that they need to merge left to bypass the work area.\n\nAnother form of barrier in the scene is a horizontal white and red barrier situated among the traffic cones. This barrier is an additional indication of the lane closure and acts as a visual cue preventing vehicles from entering the work zone.\n\nTo the side of the road, multiple brown waste bins are lined up on the sidewalk behind the traffic cones and barriers near the work area. These bins are out of the travel path of the road but contribute to the delineation of the work zoneâ€™s boundary. Although not directly affecting the roadway, the positioning of these waste bins is noteworthy as they mark the outer edge of the work zone which the ego vehicle should avoid."

Maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or maneuver if necessary.
