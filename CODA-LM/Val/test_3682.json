        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a variety of road users present which have implications for the driving behaviors of autonomous vehicles.\n\nFirstly, vehicles in the scene include a red bus-like vehicle parked on the left side of the road, facing towards the viewing vehicle. This parked vehicle could potentially hinder the autonomous vehicle's ability to switch lanes to the left and maintain a safe traveling distance. Additionally, a white SUV is observed parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the driver's viewpoint. The positioning of this SUV limits the road width available for moving traffic, hence an autonomous vehicle needs to be cautious and prepared to decelerate or stop if the SUV merges into traffic flow.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there is a motorcyclist traveling in the same direction as the observer, positioned directly in front of the autonomous vehicle. Being a dynamic road user, the motorcyclist requires the autonomous vehicle to adjust its speed and maintain a generous following distance to effectively react to any sudden movements or stops from the motorcyclist.\n\nMoreover, the scene does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, suggesting a relatively straightforward driving environment in these aspects."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed and keep a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead. Be prepared to respond to changes in the motorcycle's speed or direction. Exercise caution when overtaking parked vehicles, ensuring there are no risks posed by opening doors or moving vehicles. Regularly check your rearview mirrors, being mindful of other road users who may affect your driving behavior. Keep a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, watch for the red car on the left that may stop or change speeds, and be vigilant for road users who might be hidden behind or suddenly emerge from the parked white car on the right. Drive within the legal speed limit, and be ready for oncoming traffic due to the lack of lane markings. Maintain a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, prepare for vehicles like red cars and SUVs that may join the traffic flow, and drive carefully to avoid unseen hazards that may be obscured by buses parked on the left. Regularly monitor for pedestrians who may emerge from both sides of the road, especially around parked buses. Adjust your speed to ensure you can stop safely in case road users ahead make unpredictable movements.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a tricycle, which appears to be a motorized vehicle with three wheels, commonly used for transit or small cargo delivery in some regions. For the ego car, observing this tricycle is important because it may move slower than standard four-wheeled vehicles. The driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to overtake the tricycle when it is safe to do so, ensuring that no oncoming traffic is present and that there is enough visibility and space to pass.",

Cyclists may be less stable and slower-moving than motorized vehicles and may also be closer to the side of the road. The ego car must approach the cyclists with caution and give them ample space when passing. It's also essential to check for any indications that the cyclists may be making a turn or adjusting their course, and to pass only when it is safe, legal, and the road conditions permit adequate clearance.",
