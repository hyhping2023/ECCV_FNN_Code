Motorcycles are generally more vulnerable due to their smaller size and less stability, making it essential for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden changes in speed or direction. \n\nAdditionally, a traffic sign on the right side of the road indicates no stopping or parking, informing the ego car that stopping or parking in this area is prohibited. This ensures that the ego car remains compliant with traffic regulations by not attempting to pull over or park here.\n\nThe traffic light visible in the image is displaying a green signal, indicating that the ego car is permitted to proceed, while still needing to stay cautious and observant of any potential road hazards or changes in traffic signals.\n\nTemporary yellow and blue barriers line the right side of the ego car's lane, separating the road from an adjacent construction or off-road area. These barriers might narrow the drivable roadway which means the ego car should stay towards the left, away from the barriers.\n\nLastly, there are bare tree branches overhanging the road. While they don't pose an immediate threat, they should be noted for potential falling debris or the possibility of obstructing visibility."
