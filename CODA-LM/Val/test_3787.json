It is typically cone-shaped, marked with contrasting colors such as orange and white for high visibility, and made of a material like plastic or rubber. The presence of this traffic cone on the road indicates to the driver of the ego car that caution is needed, and they may need to adjust their driving path to avoid the cone, which could signify an obstruction or change in normal traffic patterns, such as closed lanes or construction work ahead.",

It is a conical marker with a high-visibility color and reflective stripes to ensure it is easily seen by drivers. In the context of driving behavior for the 'ego car,' the presence of this traffic cone would indicate that the driver should remain alert, slow down, and, if necessary, navigate away from the marked area to maintain safety and comply with the temporary traffic layout.",
