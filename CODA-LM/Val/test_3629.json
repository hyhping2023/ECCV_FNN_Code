        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scene, we observe different road users and signals that the ego car must consider. To the left of our vehicle, there is a red car with indicative marks on top, suggesting it might be a taxi or service vehicle, facing the same direction. Caution is necessary as this vehicle could move unexpectedly, and maintaining a safe distance is crucial for the ability to react to sudden stops or movements.\n\nFurther down the left side of the road, there's a large red truck parked alongside a row of traffic cones. This truck's presence might obstruct the view of the road ahead, potentially indicating a construction site or roadblock. This situation would require our vehicle to possibly change lanes or slow down to navigate safely.\n\nAlongside our car, a blue van bearing an orange logo is proceeding forward in the adjacent lane. The movement of this van should be monitored as it directly influences our vehicle's lane choices and driving speed.\n\nOn the left, in front of a green belt, stands a traffic sign featuring a circular red symbol. Such a sign typically denotes prohibited actions or restrictions, and understanding this sign is essential for following road rules.\n\nLastly, there are several orange traffic cones set out on the left side of the road. These cones mark the boundaries and suggest there could be ongoing road construction or a closed-off area, which might necessitate a lane merge or positional adjustment for our vehicle to continue along a safe driving path.\n\nThere are no noted vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in this scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a cautious speed, always being ready to slow down or stop for service vehicles on the left. Pay attention to any movement signals from the trucks on the left, or workers who may affect the road conditions around you. Your vehicle should keep a safe distance from the blue van on the right, and be prepared for any potential stops or unexpected movement. Due to the road construction indicated ahead, be prepared for possible lane merging or narrowing of the road. Drive carefully, especially around red trucks and taxis. Maintain a safe following distance, check your rearview mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes, and be vigilant for traffic signs or worker instructions that may not be visible in this image. Be mindful of the traffic cones on the left to avoid entering into potentially dangerous or restricted areas. Your vehicle should also be prepared to adapt to any restrictions implied by the signs on the left. In summary, drive cautiously, monitor any sudden movements of stationary vehicles, especially red taxis, and adhere to any road conditions indicated by traffic signs or cones.",
