The truck's brake lights are on, indicating it might be slowing down or stopping. This necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down, matching the truck's speed due to its size and purpose, which suggest it may make sudden stops or slow movements.

This truck's wide load and potential for debris falling necessitate cautious overtaking and monitoring. The ego car should maintain a safe distance and closely monitor this vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a directional road sign is present above the right side of the road, indicating distances to nearby locations and lane directions, suggesting lane assignments with one arrow pointing left and others pointing straight.

The mixer drum on the back is used for mixing concrete while in transit to construction sites.

Maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck in front to allow for safe reaction time if the truck stops suddenly. Stay alert for possible indications that the truck might turn or change lanes, which could affect the ego car's path. Do not attempt to overtake the truck from the right due to metal barriers restricting road width, and watch for the blue truck's movement on the left before considering a lane change in that direction. Follow the lane directions as indicated by the overhead directional sign to ensure correct positioning in the lanes. Maintain normal driving behavior with respect to the metal barriers, as they pose no immediate threat but contribute to overall road safety."
