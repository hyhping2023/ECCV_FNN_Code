        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a white sedan on the right side ahead of our autonomous vehicle in a parallel lane, driving in the same direction. The autonomous vehicle's system needs to maintain a safe following distance and be aware of any indicators from the sedan that could signal a lane change or turn. Additionally, multiple vehicles can be seen further ahead in the same lane as the autonomous vehicle, with oncoming traffic visible on the other side of the median. These vehicles provide a sense of the traffic flow and the presence of opposite-direction traffic, which must be considered in the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions.\n\nFor signaling, a green traffic light is positioned far ahead on the right side, allowing the autonomous vehicle to proceed without stopping.\n\nAlong the right side of our vehicle's lane, multiple traffic cones have been placed, marking the lane boundary and likely indicating a road hazard or construction zone. This requires the autonomous vehicle to slow down and exercise increased caution. \n\nAll other categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, and other objects, do not contain any elements in the scene and therefore do not affect the current driving scenario."

Prepare for possible adjustments in driving if traffic conditions change due to signals not currently visible or road users that may enter the scene. Adjust sensor settings to account for glare and ensure clarity of the road ahead. Continue driving with the flow of traffic as the green signal indicates it's clear to proceed. Regularly check mirrors for situational awareness and in preparation for any sudden changes due to the traffic ahead. Based on the current observed road scene, the ego car should maintain a steady speed while keeping a safe distance from the white car ahead in the adjacent lane, and be prepared for potential changes in traffic flow due to the vehicles further ahead. Additionally, the ego car should stay in the current lane, away from the demarcated area by the traffic cones, and reduce speed if necessary to safely negotiate any upcoming road work or hazard. Continuous monitoring of the surrounding traffic situation and being ready to adapt to changes is advised."
