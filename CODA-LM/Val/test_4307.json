        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a variety of road users and obstacles observed.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there's a dark-colored sedan directly in front of our vehicle on the right, sharing the same direction. The proximity and behavior of this sedan are critical as they will influence the driving decisions of our autonomous vehicle. Additionally, a bright yellow industrial vehicle is parked on the left side, positioned perpendicularly to the road. Although stationary, its presence requires attention due to its potential to disrupt the flow of traffic. Furthermore, there's a white car in the lane opposite us to the left. Its movements must be monitored for any necessary lane changes or speed adjustments our vehicle may need to undertake.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, there are cyclists wearing bright clothes riding alongside the right-hand lane, heading in the same direction as our vehicle. Given cyclists' vulnerability, it's essential for the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to alter speed or direction to avoid any risk of collision.\n\nRegarding barriers, there are red and white barriers partially blocking the right side of the road. These barriers indicate there could be hazards or roadwork ahead, which may require our vehicle to change lanes if the obstruction spills into our path.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects have been identified in the image, making them irrelevant to the current driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "This vehicle should maintain an appropriate distance from the car in front while paying attention to bicycles on the right to ensure safety. Also, watch for any unexpected movements from the parked yellow construction vehicle. The vehicle should also be alert to any sudden actions from the white car in the left lane and monitor obstacles on the right to ascertain if a lane change is necessary. Moreover, the driver should be aware of the reduced lane space on the left due to construction vehicles and obstacles, and unless it is safe and necessary, should not attempt to change lanes immediately after passing the construction area.",
