This vehicle takes up most of the lane's width and significantly affects my driving behavior as I may need to slow down, stop, or change lanes to maintain a safe distance or overtake it.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a rectangular sign with a blue background and white lettering indicates a bus stop. This implies that the bus ahead may stop frequently and passengers may get on and off, necessitating careful driving and readiness to stop at any moment.\n\nAdditionally, a metal railing is installed on the right side of the road, separating the vehicle lane from the pedestrian area. These barriers demarcate the boundaries that my vehicle should not cross to ensure the safety of pedestrians and protect property along the roadside."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and prepare to maneuver cautiously, and it must closely monitor construction vehicles to anticipate any potential incursions into our lane, and respond accordingly. It is crucial to maintain a safe distance from construction vehicles. Considering the wet road conditions, the vehicle should also be prepared for smooth braking when necessary. Additionally, the vehicle should be vigilant for any buses at transit stations that may affect the flow of traffic, and be prepared to stop or yield to construction vehicles when needed. If the size or position of a mixer truck allows, our vehicle may need to signal and change lanes to overtake, but this should only be done safely and in compliance with traffic laws, respecting the right-of-way.",

The size and nature of the vehicle suggest that it may be slower moving and could require additional space to maneuver. For the ego car, encountering this type of vehicle would warrant increased caution and potentially a reduction in speed to maintain a safe distance. Depending on the actions of the construction vehicle, the ego car may need to adjust its driving path or wait for it to turn or complete its operation before safely passing it or continuing on its way.",

The machinery takes up a significant portion of the lane, and its operation on or near the roadway may influence traffic patterns. As a result, the ego car should reduce speed and prepare to navigate around the vehicle safely, ensuring there is no incoming traffic from the opposite direction and maintaining a safe distance. Caution is advisable due to the potential for sudden movements or debris.",
