        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, we have a large truck ahead of our vehicle. It is moving in the same direction and sharing our lane. Its appearance suggests that it is loaded with goods that are not evenly distributed. The significance of this scenario is that due to the size and the load of the truck, our vehicle's driver will have a limited view of the road ahead. Therefore, it is advisable for the driver of our vehicle to maintain an increased following distance. This consideration is vital as the truck might accelerate or decelerate slower than lighter vehicles, necessitating extra space for safe maneuvering. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Be aware of traffic signs or additional signals that may be obscured by the truck. When driving, constantly adjust your lane position to maximize visibility and be prepared to take evasive actions if necessary. Use appropriate lighting settings when driving at night, and stay alert.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large construction vehicle identified by its unique, heavy-duty mixing drum at the rear - typically used for transporting and mixing concrete. In this scenario, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance behind this vehicle to account for its larger blind spots and the potential for sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle. The ego car driver should be particularly cautious if they plan to overtake, allowing for the construction vehicle's extended length and ensuring they have ample visibility and space to do so safely.",
