This sedan is currently stationary and is not affecting driving behavior but requires caution in case it starts moving or turning. Additionally, on the right side of the road, there is a construction vehicle, specifically a front-end loader, parked at an angle and partially encroaching upon the lane while facing left. This vehicle may obstruct the path of the self-driving vehicle or might move, necessitating caution and readiness to either stop or detour. There is also a parked bicycle on the right side of the road, close to a building. Although this bicycle does not directly affect driving behavior, the vehicle should ensure it remains in the proper lane to avoid any interference."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of construction vehicles that may move or obstruct parts of the traffic lanes, please drive cautiously. Maintain a safe distance from the stationary sedan on your left in case it suddenly moves. Pay special attention to bicycles on your right, and be prepared to change your lane position according to the road width and traffic conditions to maintain a safe distance. It is not recommended to change lanes immediately unless construction vehicles begin to enter the roadway or obstruct the normal driving route of your vehicle. Since wet road conditions may affect braking distance, it is necessary to adjust the driving style accordingly.",

Its presence indicates potential roadwork ahead. In the context of driving, the ego car should slow down, be prepared for possible detours or lane closures, and watch for construction workers and additional construction machinery entering or exiting the work area.",
