It's a possible dynamic obstacle if its rider decides to start moving. A cyclist is also present, positioned on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, and appears to be either stationary or moving slowly, which could affect the driving path and speed of the ego car to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic signs on the right side of the road. The first one is a pedestrian crossing sign, alerting the ego vehicle to be prepped to stop for any pedestrians who might cross the street. The second sign indicates a 'No Parking' area, which is particularly relevant given that there is a motorcycle parked in that area despite the prohibition, prompting extra vigilance for other potentially incorrectly parked vehicles.\n\nWhile there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in the image, there are other objects to keep in mind. Various objects on the sidewalk to the right include a dustbin and some bicycle-sharing bikes. Although these are not directly on the ego vehicleâ€™s path, caution is advised since their movement onto the roadway by pedestrians or incidents of pedestrians stepping into the lane could present unexpected obstacles."

Continue to monitor the road conditions as lighting is low, and unexpected hazards can occur. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from the cyclist and be prepared for any movements from the parked motorcycle."
