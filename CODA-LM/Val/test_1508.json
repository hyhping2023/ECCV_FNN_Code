Additionally, a directional sign is present on the right side, showing a left arrow, which indicates that there is a left turn or curve approaching. This sign alerts us that we may need to alter our speed or reposition ourselves to safely navigate the upcoming curve. Furthermore, there are multiple traffic cones placed on both sides of the road, suggesting a lane narrowing or construction zone ahead, compelling us to drive cautiously and perhaps slow down. Alongside the road, but not affecting traffic, there is a dustbin and some foliage to the right, as well as a partial view of what appears to be an enclosure or small building. These objects do not impact our driving behavior since they are not on the roadway."
