        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are multiple cars and a heavy construction vehicle observed. The construction vehicle, which is yellow in color and situated in the right lane ahead, has clear contact information and markings, identifying it as a heavy vehicle. Due to its size and potential slowness, an autonomous vehicle must carefully decide whether to adjust its speed or change lanes to overtake it. Additionally, on the adjacent lane to the left, there are several moving cars of various colors traveling parallel to our vehicle. These vehicles might change lanes, thereby impacting the ability of the autonomous vehicle to safely change lanes."

    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead. Since it occupies the right lane, if there is a need to overtake the slower construction vehicle, the lead vehicle should prepare to change to the left lane while ensuring the maneuver is safe and in compliance with lane markings and traffic regulations. If the current lane remains the best path and there is no pressing need to overtake, the lead vehicle should adjust its speed to match that of the construction vehicle until it can safely and appropriately pass. Maintaining a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead ensures enough reaction time and visibility. Monitor the behavior of vehicles in adjacent lanes, especially signs of lane-changing intentions, while paying attention to traffic cones that mark potential road work or obstacles. Unless the construction vehicle slows down or stops, there is no immediate need to change lanes; at this point, after assessing nearby traffic, consider safely moving to the left lane. If it aligns with traffic flow and there are no road work signs indicating otherwise, maintain the current speed. The lead vehicle should keep a safe distance from the construction vehicle and be prepared to respond to any sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. If the lane width allows, slightly shift away from the direction of the construction vehicle to avoid potential hazards from its load. Stay alert for any signs or signals from road workers, and be ready to adapt to changes in traffic pattern due to road construction.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a yellow wheeled loader commonly used in construction activities for moving materials. It is visible from the rear, displaying cautionary markings such as reflective stripes for enhanced visibility and a phone number possibly for business inquiries or reporting. This vehicle, given its size and function, may operate at slower speeds and could make unexpected maneuvers. The presence of this vehicle suggests that there might be construction activity nearby, and thus, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, reduce speed, and be prepared for potential stops or diversions.",
