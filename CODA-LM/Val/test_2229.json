        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, the only significant objects are traffic cones, which are described as being arranged in a row in red and white colors. These cones demarcate the boundary between a construction area on the right side and the usable road on the left. The presence of these traffic cones is crucial as they signal that a section of the road is potentially closed for construction or maintenance, effectively narrowing the available road space for vehicles. This setup necessitates careful navigation and altered driving behavior to accommodate the reduced drivable road width."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe speed, make choices at the upcoming intersection according to traffic signs, and stay within the lanes marked by traffic cones, being alert for possible workers or machinery. Drive carefully, being prepared for changes in lane structure or construction ahead on the road. Pay close attention to other road users or changing conditions, especially as surrounding snow indicates the potential for colder temperatures and the likelihood of black ice. Following the guidance of traffic cones to ensure safety and compliance with temporary traffic flow adjustments is crucial.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a conical object marked with alternating bands of orange and white, commonly known as a traffic cone. It is typically used to mark areas that are not to be entered or to delineate construction zones, temporary traffic lanes, or boundaries for driving obstacles. In this particular scenario, the presence of this traffic cone indicates that the driver of the ego car should be cautious and prepared to adjust their driving pathway in response to a potential change in usual traffic patterns, and it may imply that there may be roadwork ahead, an accident, or other temporary change in the roadway that the driver needs to be aware of. The driver should slow down and be prepared to follow alternative routing as directed by additional signs, cones, or road personnel.",

It's often used during road construction projects or other situations where parts of the road need to be closed off for safety reasons. The presence of this cone indicates that the ego car should be cautious and prepared to change lanes or adjust its course to avoid the section of road that the cone is delineating.",
