The absence of any visible traffic lights or signage means the ego car must rely on general traffic rules and situational awareness. Proceed with caution, maintaining a lower speed to react to any unexpected movements from the pedestrian. Be prepared to stop if the pedestrian steps onto the roadway. Keep a safe distance from the parked cars to allow room for maneuvering if someone opens a car door or if pedestrians step out from between parked vehicles. Watching for any signals from the white car with brake lights, the ego vehicle should be ready to yield to avoid any potential conflict as it maneuvers."
