This vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to adapt its speed or change lanes in response to the truck's actions. Additionally, several other vehicles are ahead in the same lane, their tail lights glowing, their movement will determine the ego car's speed and lane usage.\n\nAhead, there are traffic lights displaying a green signal that give the ego vehicle the right of way; however, the ego vehicle needs to stay vigilant for the potential change of the traffic lights and movements of other road users.\n\nOn the right side of the lane are traffic cones, suggesting possible road work or a lane closure. These cones necessitate that the autonomous car proceeds with caution, potentially reducing speed to navigate safely.\n\nThere are metal barriers on both sides of the road, channeling traffic flow and limiting access to the areas beside the road. The presence of these barriers means the ego car must keep within the lane markings and avoid any lane changes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects in the image, as per the provided data."
