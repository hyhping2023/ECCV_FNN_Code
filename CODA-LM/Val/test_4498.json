        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a couple of vehicles on the road. A green vehicle is positioned in the right lane ahead and appears to be in motion. It is directly in the path of our self-driving car, thus it is important to maintain a safe following distance and adjust the speed accordingly. Additionally, a light-colored van is traveling in the same direction and is noted in the leftmost lane. The van's lane positioning suggests it might maintain its current lane or possibly merge right.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights noted in this situation, so there is no need to consider these elements in the current driving strategy.\n\nOn the road's right side, orange and white traffic cones are set up, which serve as a warning of potential obstacles ahead. Drivers should be prepared to adjust their lane position due to parts of the road possibly being closed off for safety or construction reasons.\n\nAlongside the traffic cones, there are metal railings and glass walls, indicating the presence of a construction area. These barriers lead to a narrowed pathway, signaling vehicles should remain within the open lanes.\n\nFinally, there are additional fragments scattered on the right side of the road. These fragments could become dynamic obstacles if they were to move into the driving lane, so the autonomous vehicle should be prepared to detect any unexpected movement and respond swiftly to avoid them."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the green vehicle ahead, observe the van on the left for potential lane changes, and prepare to drive in the center or left lane to avoid debris and navigate around the construction area, while paying attention to traffic cones. Watch the brake lights and turn signals of the van and the green vehicle to anticipate sudden stops or turns that might affect your driving path. Keep a safe following distance from the green sedan ahead, ready to slow down or change lanes at any time due to road debris, and monitor the position of the van, taking into account the narrowing of the road due to the construction indicated by traffic cones. At this stage, given the limited visibility ahead and no clear space in the neighboring lanes, your vehicle should not attempt to overtake. As the wet road surface may affect braking and handling, please drive cautiously. Considering the presence of taxis, traffic cones, obstacles, and debris, you should slow down, increase the distance from taxis, and be prepared to change lanes to the left when the lane ahead is obstructed or unsafe. Remain vigilant, and be aware of any unexpected movements from construction workers or obstacles related to road construction.",
