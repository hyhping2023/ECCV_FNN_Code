However, there are notable appearances and potential hazards from vulnerable road users and other objects at the side of the road. \n\nSpecifically, two individuals are observed standing near what appear to be large industrial cable spools on the side of the road. The proximity of these individuals to the driving area poses a potential hazard, given the risk they might unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\nAdditionally, there are large spools of cable and other equipment located at the side of the road. These objects could indicate a potential work area ahead, possibly affecting the traffic flow. Also present are industrial cable spools and a dustbin near the individuals, placed at the side of the road. These objects are stationary and, while they should not directly impact the ego car's path, require awareness from the driver to avoid any unexpected incidents."
