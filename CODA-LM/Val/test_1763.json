Also, there are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects in the image.\n\nHowever, on the right side at an intersection, a traffic light is visible showing a red signal. This red light is a directive for the vehicles to stop, ensuring they do not proceed through the intersection until it changes to green.\n\nAdditionally, there are construction barriers to the right side of the road, which appear to partially block the sidewalk. These barriers indicate that there may be road work ahead or a potential detour. As a result, these barriers serve as a warning for the ego car to be prepared to navigate changes in the road layout or closed lanes accordingly."
