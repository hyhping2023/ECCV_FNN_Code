        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a significant presence of a large yellow construction vehicle, described as being parked on the right side of the road. It is notable for partially obstructing the right lane. This scenario presents a situation where the construction vehicle could pose a potential hazard by reducing the drivable area of the roadway. As a result, this could necessitate a lane change to bypass the vehicle safely. The presence of this construction vehicle also brings up the possibility that it could either move or become a more active hazard, further emphasizing the need for caution and adjustment by the autonomous vehicle or driver.\n\nAdditionally, overhead directional signs are prominently featured within the scene. These signs are critical for navigation as they indicate the divisions of lanes and directions for traffic flow. Specifically, they point out a fork in the road ahead, offering drivers the option to keep either left or right. The existence of these signs serves an essential purpose by guiding the vehicle on lane usage and alerting to potential roadworks or lane closures that lie ahead. This information is crucial for the autonomous vehicle or driver in making informed decisions on lane selection well in advance, ensuring a smooth continuation of the journey in the correct direction.\n\nThe scene does not contain any vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, nor does it feature traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects that might influence driving behavior or require additional navigational considerations."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle with visible features such as a yellow color, and machinery components. This vehicle typically performs operations related to road work or construction site activities. The presence of this vehicle partially in the roadway indicates that there may be ongoing construction or road maintenance work ahead. Therefore, the ego car should reduce its speed, proceed with caution, and be prepared to follow any temporary traffic signs or directions. This may include changing lanes if the current lane is obstructed by the construction vehicle.",

The driver must also stay alert for any new signage or changes in road conditions that may indicate construction zones or other roadwork activities ahead. Maintain a safe following distance from vehicles ahead. Prepare to merge into the left lane due to the obstructed right lane, taking care to observe the rear-view and side mirrors for other traffic, and signal appropriately before changing lanes. Decide in advance which direction to follow at the upcoming fork and position accordingly. Continue to monitor the road for any changes in traffic patterns caused by the construction vehicle or other road users. Monitor the parked construction vehicle for any signs of movement, and prepare to merge left if necessary, especially if the car is not intending to turn right. It is also advisable to reduce speed due to the reduced visibility and potential for unexpected hazards in this kind of road work zone."
