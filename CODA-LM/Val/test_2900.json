One forklift is partially visible in the left lane, while the other is fully visible in the right lane, both facing away from the ego car. These forklifts are occupying the lanes ahead, suggesting a potential work zone or area for loading and unloading activities. Their presence necessitates that the ego car either alter its path or come to a halt. Additionally, cautious driving is crucial as there is the possibility of the forklifts suddenly moving or operators appearing around them."

It appears to be a compact heavy equipment machine, commonly used for earthmoving tasks, which might include a front-mounted bucket that could be used for transporting materials. The presence of this vehicle indicates construction activity nearby. Due to its size and distinctive functionality, the ego car should maintain awareness of the vehicle's movements and potential for unexpected maneuvers. Adjusting speed and steering clear of its operational range is crucial for safe navigation through the area.",
