It may merge or slow down, so our vehicle needs to be prepared to slow down or change lanes at any time. The second vehicle is a heavy equipment transport vehicle moving in the same direction, with red machinery visible on the trailer. Its slower speed and larger load capacity may lead to changes in traffic flow, and our vehicle needs to anticipate these changes in advance. The third vehicle is a white SUV on the right side of our vehicle, sharing the same lane with a truck carrying red machinery, both heading in the same direction. This vehicle may affect the flow of traffic, so our vehicle should be vigilant for any sudden movements from it.\n\nThere are also steel guardrails installed on the left side to separate opposite lanes, while the right side is used for protecting against roadside hazards. These obstacles limit lane-changing and overtaking maneuvers, defining the drivable space for the vehicle.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the van ahead, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes if it suddenly switches lanes or decelerates. Observe the dynamics of the truck in the left lane and the vehicles behind it, as they may attempt to merge into your lane, which requires vigilance and possibly a speed adjustment. Drive carefully due to the wet road conditions, which may extend the braking distance and reduce vehicle handling performance. Continuously monitor the lane-changing actions of surrounding vehicles, and be ready to change lanes at any time if the vehicle in front starts to slow down.",
