On the left side, there's a white car parked beside what might be a small building or bus stop. This parked car doesn't interfere with the autonomous vehicle's path but caution is advised in case someone opens a door or pedestrians are nearby. Another white car is traveling on the right lane in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle, which poses no immediate threat but should be kept in view for any unpredictable movements. A vehicle towing a trailer recently passed on the right, which is moving slower and could impact our vehicle's speed if overtaking is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist on the same lane as our vehicle, moving away from us. This signals a need for the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and speed as motorcycles have the ability to slow down or change lanes abruptly. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that could affect driving behavior."
