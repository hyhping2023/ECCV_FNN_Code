        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene presented, we have a variety of road users and signs to consider:\n\n1. Vehicles: There is a white sedan in the left lane close to our car. It appears to be slowing down or may have already come to a stop. As an autonomous vehicle, it's crucial to consider the sedan's positioning and speed to adjust our lane choice and speed accordingly.\n\n2. Vulnerable Road Users: We can observe two individuals wearing high-visibility clothing. One of them is standing near a traffic cone, and the other is walking towards a bus stop, suggesting potential pedestrian activity that requires our vigilance and readiness to stop. Additionally, a pedestrian is crossing the street directly in front of us from right to left, granting them the right of way and compelling us to yield. Furthermore, a security guard in noticeable attire is in the midst of traffic. Their presence could necessitate halting or slowing down based on their hand signals. Finally, thereâ€™s a motorcyclist stopped near the bus station on the right, who might merge back into traffic and should be monitored closely as we pass.\n\n3. Traffic Signs: We can see two important signs. A speed limit sign mandates a maximum of 30 kilometers per hour and is placed alongside a no parking or stopping sign. These require compliance with speed regulation and prohibit stopping or parking in this area.\n\n4. Traffic Cones: A sequence of orange cones has been set up ahead in the right lane, guiding vehicles into what could be a checkpoint or roadblock area, indicating a lane closure or restriction. It's necessary for our vehicle to remain in the left lane and follow the directed path.\n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are reported in this scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should maintain a safe speed, not exceeding 30 kilometers per hour as indicated by traffic signs, and stay in the left lane to avoid traffic cones and vehicles that may merge into the traffic flow from the right lane blockage. Be prepared to respond at any time to nearby high-visibility workers. It is advised to monitor police motorcycles parked on the roadside, in case they enter the driving lane, requiring cautious driving due to the possibility of roadblocks or police enforcement activities. Always be vigilant of pedestrians' erratic movements and be ready to give way if necessary. Drivers should slow down to comply with the speed limit signs of 30 kilometers per hour and be prepared to stop for pedestrians crossing the road. When passing through areas with traffic cones and police motorcycles, vehicles should be ready to follow additional instructions from security personnel and drive cautiously to safely navigate through temporary traffic conditions.",
