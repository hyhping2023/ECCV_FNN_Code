The ego car needs to adjust its speed and positioning as a result. Additionally, the road ahead features several cars travelling in both directions that dictate the overall traffic flow.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians are present, some of whom may be intending to cross the street, and a pair is already crossing the pedestrian crosswalk further ahead. This requires the ego vehicle to be prepared to yield, in consideration of the pedestrians' right of way.\n\nThe image lacks any traffic signs immediately impacting the ego car's path; thus, it is expected to follow general traffic rules, guided by traffic lights and road markings. Traffic lights are visible, showing green for going straight and red for the turning lane, directing the ego car to proceed with caution if the path is clear, while staying alert for potential vehicles that could run the opposite red light.\n\nTraffic cones, colored yellow and red, are positioned to the right side of the intersection, indicating there may be a closed lane or construction, suggesting the need for a potential lane change. Similarly, a yellow and red-striped barrier on the near right side of the intersection might represent road works or a closure and an associated lane change or increased attention to potential obstacles.\n\nLastly, there are no other objects in the image that could affect the driving behavior, allowing the ego car to maintain the usual level of vigilance for unexpected impediments."

Maintaining a safe following distance from vehicles ahead and staying alert for any pedestrians who may begin to cross is also advised. The ego car should also monitor the pedestrians to the right for safe crossing. The green light indicates the right to proceed, but caution is advised since vehicles and pedestrians may still behave unpredictably. Additionally, be aware of potential obstructions or changes in traffic flow due to the barrier by the sidewalk. It is also paramount to confirm that cross traffic is indeed stopping for their red light before proceeding."
