A yellow construction vehicle is positioned sideways, taking up the left lane and encroaching on the right lane, with its front facing left. This poses an immediate hazard as it disrupts traffic flow and limits the ego car's maneuvering space. Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road, which could potentially open doors or move unexpectedly, necessitating cautious driving from the ego car. A black car is also parked on the left, indicating a busy roadside but not directly obstructing the ego car's path. Furthermore, an autorickshaw is in the same lane as the ego car, just ahead, suggesting a potential overtaking situation.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian crossing the street in front of the parked car nearest to the ego vehicle, wearing a light-colored outfit and moving away from the curb. The pedestrian's presence means the ego car must slow down or stop to ensure their safety. On the right, another motorized three-wheeled vehicle with a driver in dark clothing is facing away from the ego car and seems to be moving forward. This vehicle may move unpredictably, and the ego car should stay alert and ready to respond.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the scene."

Given its location on the road and its substantial size, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and possibly slow down or stop to allow the construction vehicle to complete its maneuvering or to safely navigate around it, if possible.

Proceed with caution once the pedestrian has safely crossed and the way ahead is clear, checking for any possible actions by the front loader and the autorickshaw ahead."
