        "description and explanation": "The image shows several road users and objects that impact the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there are two vehicles present:\n1. A white passenger car directly in front of the ego-vehicle, either stationary or moving slowly. This car influences the ego car's ability to move forward and dictates the following distance that must be maintained for safety.\n2. A large yellow construction vehicle to the right, carrying construction equipment on its trailer, moving in the same direction as the ego-vehicle. Due to its size and nature of operation, this vehicle may be moving slowly, posing potential obstacles and reducing the available road width ahead. Caution is needed when considering overtaking or adjusting speed.\n\nThere are two traffic signs visible:\n1. Overhead lane direction signs with arrows indicating straight or rightward movement. These signs help the ego-vehicle understand which lane to use for the desired direction of travel.\n2. An overhead blue direction sign mounted on a truck, indicating an upcoming road split or junction. This sign provides important navigational information, possibly requiring a lane change or preparation for a turn based on the intended route.\n\nBarriers are present in two locations:\n1. White portable barriers are on the right side of the ego-vehicle, likely indicating a boundary between the driving lanes and a construction or restricted area. These barriers dictate the drivable area and caution the ego-vehicle to avoid the restricted zone.\n2. White protective barriers are on the left side of the ego car's lane, creating a narrow passage. These barriers limit the available space on the left side, preventing any attempt to overtake or change lanes to the left.\n\nLastly, there are reflections or glares from street lights visible on the camera lens. These glares can affect the perception of the environment by the human driver or on-board sensors of the ego car, potentially complicating object and traffic recognition."

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle is present, characterized by its heavy equipment and machinery designed for construction tasks. Due to its size and the nature of the equipment it is carrying, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to allow for adequate reaction time if the construction vehicle were to slow down or stop suddenly. Additionally, the driver of the ego car should be alert for potential debris or materials that could fall from the construction vehicle, and be prepared for any unexpected maneuvers it may make.",

Be wary of low visibility conditions due to time of day and possible lens flare, and stay alert for any changes around the construction zone marked by the barriers. Follow directional signs appropriately to ensure correct navigational decisions are made in advance. Additionally, stay alert to the positioning of the large construction vehicle to the right, being ready to adjust within the lane to avoid any potential overhang from its cargo. Be aware of the potential need to change lanes or alter driving behavior due to the traffic sign on the back of the construction vehicle indicating a merge or lane split ahead. No immediate action is required, but increased vigilance is necessary due to the narrow passage and the heavy vehicles in close proximity."
