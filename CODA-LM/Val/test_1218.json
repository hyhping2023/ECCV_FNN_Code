        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are a couple of vehicles on the road. A truck is observed in the right lane ahead, visible transporting dark-colored rolls of material and occupying its entire lane. The truck's size and the cargo it carries are important considerations when planning overtaking maneuvers and estimating the necessary stopping distance behind it. Additionally, a forklift is operational, moving in the same direction as our vehicle on the right edge of the road. Its presence implies a potential speed differential with our vehicle, which might result in our vehicle having to either decelerate or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists, present in this scenario, there are traffic signs providing essential information. To the right, there is a sign displaying a red cross on a blue background within a red circle, which signifies that stopping or parking is not allowed for any motor vehicles in that zone. Moreover, a speed limit sign is indicating that drivers must not exceed 40 kilometers per hour on this section of the road.\n\nFor navigation through the intersection, the current state of the traffic light is crucial. It shows a green light for the straight-through lane, suggesting that as long as the traffic environment is clear and safe, the vehicle may proceed.\n\nThe image doesn't contain any traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects that might influence driving behavior in this specific instance."

    "driving_suggestion": "Control your speed appropriately according to the speed limit signs and drive carefully. Be prepared to adjust your speed or change lanes as necessary to maintain a safe distance from the forklifts and trucks ahead. Be aware of potential changes caused by the truck movements. Continue straight ahead when the traffic light is green, and the sign indicates to proceed straight. Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle in front, stay aware of its movements, and be prepared for any sudden stops. At the green light, pass through intersections with caution, especially looking out for any forklifts that might be moving on your right side to avoid risks. Continue to pay attention to the traffic signs and do not stop temporarily or for an extended time on this stretch of road.",

This type of vehicle is commonly used for various tasks at construction sites such as digging, material handling, and demolition. Its presence suggests that there may be construction work going on nearby. For the ego vehicle, this means that it should proceed with caution, maintaining awareness for potential construction workers or obstacles that may suddenly appear in the roadway from the construction zone.
