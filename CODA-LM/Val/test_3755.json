There is a white car positioned in the same lane, slightly to the right and in front of our vehicle, facing the same direction but slightly tilted, potentially indicating it is about to turn or change lanes. Our vehicle needs to be prepared for the white car to decelerate, turn right, or change lanes, which will influence its driving decisions.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, pedestrians are observed near a crosswalk area. Although they are not currently on the road, they could decide to cross, prompting our vehicle to closely monitor their movements. Additionally, a cyclist is seen riding in the same direction as traffic in the bicycle lane on the right. The vehicle is required to maintain a safe distance and be alert to any sudden movements from the cyclist.\n\nThe road's signage includes a large blue directional sign and a smaller red and white no right turn sign, informing drivers of what to expect ahead and indicating that turning right at the upcoming intersection is prohibited, which will influence the vehicle's routing.\n\nVisible on the right side are traffic cones in a line, suggesting construction or a temporary detour is present, signaling the autonomous car to avoid these parts of the lane and watch for potential nearby obstacles or workers.\n\nMetal barriers have been placed in the center of the road to separate the opposing lanes, ensuring that the self-driving car stays within its lane and is attentive to possible pedestrian crossing points.\n\nFurthermore, there exists an 'other object' classification, in which a pedestrian, possibly a worker, is noticed standing by a traffic cone and focusing on the road. This suggests roadwork may be occurring, and autonomous vehicles should reduce speed and proceed with extra caution.\n\nThere are no traffic lights reported in the image, indicating no need for the vehicle to adjust for signal changes at this segment of the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a cautious speed due to the presence of various road users, including vehicles and vulnerable road users, as well as possible lane obstructions caused by traffic cones, necessitating vigilance. Be prepared at all times for the white car to possibly change lanes or turn, and take note of pedestrians who may enter the road from bus stops. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from cyclists and adhere to the instructions given by traffic signs and cones. Drive carefully, keeping a safe distance from the white car ahead. The pedestrian wearing an orange jacket and the traffic cones indicate a potential work zone, so be alert for the presence of workers on the road. Pay attention to signs marking the start and end of the work zone. If necessary, be ready to adjust your lane position to safely maneuver around the traffic cones without entering restricted areas. Due to the prohibition sign, do not make a right turn at the upcoming intersection. The vehicle should obey traffic signs and proceed straight without turning right. Given the variable road conditions and the presence of road users, including possible workers near the cones, the driver should increase their attentiveness.",

In this driving scenario, the cones influence the driving behavior by guiding the ego vehicle to stay on the correct path and avoid the section of the road that they are marking off.",
