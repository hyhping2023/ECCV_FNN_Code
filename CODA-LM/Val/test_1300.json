This object is substantial in size and occupies a considerable amount of space on the road. The presence of such a vehicle suggests there could be nearby construction activity. As a result, the driver of the ego car needs to be cautious, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops ahead.",

Given the green light signal for going straight, the ego vehicle should proceed through the intersection with caution, respecting any potential right-of-way or yielding scenarios especially related to the motorcycles and bus ahead."
