It shows signs of wear and construction material residues. This truck's presence and movements require the ego car to maintain a safe distance to ensure adequate reaction time and safety, especially since the truck may stop or slow down unpredictably.\n   - **Sedan**: Seen on the left side in the side mirror, located in an adjacent lane. This position may restrict the ego carâ€™s lateral maneuvering options, particularly if a lane change is being considered. \n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - **Crosswalk Signs**: These indicate potential areas where pedestrians may be crossing. They serve as a reminder to be vigilant and prepared to yield to pedestrians at crosswalk areas.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - **Pedestrian Crossing Sign**: Located on the right side of the road, reinforcing the presence of a crosswalk ahead. This sign emphasizes the need for extra caution to anticipate pedestrians crossing the street.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects were observed in the image."

Be vigilant for any pedestrians that may approach the crosswalk, as indicated by the pedestrian crossing signs, and be ready to stop if necessary to give them the right of way. Stay alert for possible pedestrian activity due to the crossing sign. Keep an eye on the sedan in the adjacent lane to anticipate its movements and reduce the potential for conflict during maneuvers. Unless necessary, do not attempt to overtake the truck until a safe opportunity arises and ensure the adjacent lane is clear before doing so."
