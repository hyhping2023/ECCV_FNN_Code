Once the signal turns green and the path is clear of pedestrians and vehicles, the ego car can continue through the intersection or execute any planned maneuvers, such as turning, according to the traffic rules and directional signs. Additionally, the driver should be aware of the potential need to change lanes ahead due to parked vehicles on the side of the road."
