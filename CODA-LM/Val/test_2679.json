It is partially blocking the oncoming traffic lane and the left-turning lane with its front-loading bucket. This vehicle is a potential obstacle as it could block the ego vehicle's path and disrupt the flow of traffic, especially if the ego vehicle intends to make a left turn.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars waiting at the intersection behind the construction vehicle. While they are not immediate obstacles, their presence suggests that the ego vehicle will need to navigate through traffic once the light turns green.\n\nA white sedan is also present beyond the construction vehicle, facing the direction of the ego vehicle on the opposite side of the intersection. This sedan could affect the ego vehicle's decision-making when proceeding through the intersection after the traffic light turns green and the construction vehicle moves out of the way, as it may start moving towards the ego vehicle.\n\nOn the traffic light pole to the left side of the road, there is a pedestrian crossing sign, indicating a crossing area ahead. This sign is important for the ego vehicle to be aware of, as it may need to yield or stop for pedestrians, even if the traffic signals indicate it is permissible to proceed.\n\nThe traffic lights for the lane the ego vehicle is in, as well as the oncoming traffic lanes, are red. Two sets of traffic lights show a red light for the direction the ego vehicle is facing, and the pedestrian signals also display a red figure, indicating that crossing is not allowed. The red traffic lights mean that the ego vehicle and other road users must come to a complete stop and wait for the lights to change to green before proceeding.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

The presence of the construction vehicle across the intersection requires increased attention as the situation may change. Once the traffic light turns green, proceed with caution, especially if turning left, to ensure the construction vehicle is not obstructing the path and to be aware of other vehicles potentially navigating around it. Additionally, the ego car driver should be alert for any pedestrians that might be crossing the street, respecting the pedestrian crossing sign. While waiting, the driver should be aware of the construction vehicle's movements and be prepared to yield way if it continues its turn. If the construction vehicle moves out of the intersection and the lights turn green, the ego car can proceed with caution, particularly noting the white sedan's position and any other possible oncoming traffic before moving through the intersection."
