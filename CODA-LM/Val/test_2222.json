It is described as a large, potentially a truck, which appears blurred and takes up a significant part of the visible area. The blurriness of the image makes it challenging to determine its precise position and movement, presenting uncertainty and potential risk to the autonomous driving system of the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in the image."

It can be identified by its large tires and the structural design typical of cargo-carrying vehicles. The presence of this object on the road will influence the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating a safe following distance and readiness for potential wide turns the truck may perform, as these vehicles have larger blind spots and require more space to maneuver.",
