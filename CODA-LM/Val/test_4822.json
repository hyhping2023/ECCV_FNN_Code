Although the parked vehicle is not moving and thus doesn't present an immediate threat, its location on the side of the road could potentially conceal pedestrians crossing the road, and it also narrows the amount of space available for the ego vehicle to maneuver.\n\nClose to this parked vehicle, there is a person standing by the road next to a traffic cone. The pedestrian's proximity to the traffic lane is a potential safety concern as there is a chance they might step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones positioned alongside the parked vehicle. These cones suggest a possible temporary road obstruction or construction work, signaling that the ego vehicle should be cautious and alert while driving past this area.\n\nThe scene takes place in a low-visibility setting, likely during nighttime hours, making it harder to see and react to potential hazards. This environmental condition necessitates a more cautious driving approach, with reduced speed and heightened awareness.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image, hence they are not accounted for in this summary."
