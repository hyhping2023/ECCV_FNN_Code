This large vehicle's size and proximity may obstruct the view ahead and may also move slowly, requiring the ego car to consider changing lanes or adjusting speed. There is also a grey sedan on the left close to the ego car, moving in the same direction. The sedan's proximity to the ego car indicates the need for the ego car to be aware of the sedan's movements to avoid collisions and to be prepared for any potential lane changes from it.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, several pedestrians are on the sidewalk to the right of the industrial vehicle. Although they are not on the roadway, their presence requires monitoring in case any of them decide to cross the street unexpectedly. There is also a group of cyclists on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Cyclists can affect traffic flow and safety, so the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be cautious when overtaking to prevent collisions.\n\nThere is a rectangular road sign mounted on a pole to the right, which seems to be indicating a junction ahead with auxiliary directions. This sign indicates upcoming intersections which the ego car may need to navigate, informing about lane choice and possible turns.\n\nLastly, there is a street light pole adjacent to the road on the right, which does not directly affect the driving scenario. However, the light pole itself does not influence driving behavior but should be noted as a fixed object near the roadway. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

Monitor the pedestrians on the sidewalk and be cautious of potential pedestrians crossing. Pay attention to the junction signs to anticipate upcoming intersections or turns. Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed appropriately to ensure safety. Be mindful of the cyclists by giving them ample room and only overtake when it's safe to do so without impeding their path. Keep a safe following distance from the grey sedan on the left, especially since it may react to the construction vehicle's presence as well. Look ahead for any traffic signs or signals at the upcoming junction and be prepared for vehicles' actions responding to the junction. Anticipate potential hazards from the junction like turning vehicles and adjust speed accordingly."
