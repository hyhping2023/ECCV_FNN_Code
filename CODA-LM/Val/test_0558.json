There are no traffic lights affecting the immediate driving decisions.\n\nTraffic cones are placed in the left lane, starting near the ego vehicle and extending past the ambulance, indicating a route alteration or potential obstruction. This signals the ego car to stay on the right lane to safely pass the scene. No barriers visible impact the ego car's immediate lane, thus not requiring any immediate changes in the driving path.\n\nLastly, the road surface appears wet with possible reflections or lights, indicating recent rain or wet conditions.
