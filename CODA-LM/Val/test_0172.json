The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down further. There are no vulnerable road users visible, so no specific action is required regarding pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a traffic sign indicating a speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour, with an additional sign below it warning of pedestrian crossing. The ego car should adhere to the speed limit and be alert for potential pedestrians crossing the road. A green traffic light ahead allows vehicles to proceed through the intersection, so the ego car can continue to move forward if the traffic conditions are safe, following the lead of the vehicle in front.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are positioned to the right of the ego car's lane, marking a section of the road that might be closed or under construction. The ego car should stay within its lane and be aware of the reduced road width. There are no visible barriers obstructing the ego car's path, so no action is required in this regard.\n\nLastly, there are large industrial objects on the right side of the road, beyond the traffic cones, suggesting a potential construction or work area nearby. While these objects do not directly affect the roadway, their presence indicates that there could be influences on road conditions, and the ego car should drive cautiously."

            "description and explanation": "A bollard is a sturdy, short vertical post. The primary purpose of a bollard in traffic control is to guide vehicles and prevent them from entering specific areas or to protect pedestrians and property. In this scenario, the bollard marks the edge of the roadway, likely indicating to drivers to maintain their lane and discouraging them from driving into the area beyond the marked road. The presence of this bollard influences the future driving behavior of the ego car by indicating the boundary of the driving area and making the driver aware of the limited road space, ensuring the vehicle remains within the designated lane.",

Keep an eye on the large objects on the sidewalk as a precaution."
