    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, pay attention to construction vehicles, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes to avoid them if necessary. Continuously monitor pedestrian activity on the sidewalks. Drive carefully and be aware of construction vehicles on the left that may reduce the available road space. Also, be prepared and watch for vehicles in the right lane that may merge into your lane or affect your lane-changing options. Stay alert for any sudden movements from the green shrubbery by the roadside.",
