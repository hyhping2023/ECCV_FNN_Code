This stationary vehicle could pose a potential obstruction because the open trunk might extend into the lane, which would necessitate the ego car to either switch lanes or navigate carefully around the obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there is an adult pedestrian standing close to the open trunk of the parked white car, facing away from the road. This pedestrian presents a hazard as there is a possibility they could step onto the road unexpectedly. The ego car must therefore keep an eye on this pedestrian's movements and be ready to come to a stop if necessary.\n\nOn the left side of the road, before a roundabout, there is a directional sign indicating a right turn ahead. This sign serves to guide the flow of traffic and signals to the ego car the necessity to stay right, which is of particular importance in case the car needs to change lanes due to the parked vehicle on the side of the road.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, suggesting that these elements are either not present or not relevant to the driving scenario captured in the image."

Proceed with caution, maintain a safe distance from the parked car and the pedestrian, be prepared to stop or adjust trajectory if the pedestrian moves unpredictably. Adhere to the sign directions if looking for parking. Monitor for any changes in road users' behavior, and additional signs or signals."
