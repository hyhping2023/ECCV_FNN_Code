These vehicles are either stationary or moving at a slow pace. Due to these traffic conditions, it is essential for the vehicle to stay alert and maintain a sufficient following distance, possibly requiring the vehicle to decelerate. \n\nMoreover, there's a blue traffic sign positioned on the left side of the road that provides directional or location information. Though this sign doesn't have an immediate impact on driving decisions, it is essential for drivers to use it for navigational purposes.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles and sign, white barriers have been set up on the left side of the road, delineating a clear separation between the lane designated for vehicles and the construction or pedestrian area. The installation of these barriers suggests a potential narrowing of the driving space on the left and underscores the need for the vehicle to stay within its lane. It also highlights the importance of being watchful for any unforeseen obstacles or workers that may be adjacent to the roadway."

Stay alert for any potential movements in the traffic jam on the left and continue to follow road sign navigation, respecting the lane divisions indicated by separation facilities. Adjust your speed according to the traffic flow and remain vigilant for changes in traffic patterns due to closed lanes or construction areas. Given the presence of traffic congestion and separation facilities, drivers should also be prepared to deal with sudden stops, avoid changing lanes, and maintain a safe lateral distance from any restrictions.",

The presence of a bus in traffic typically requires extra caution from drivers, as buses make frequent stops and can obstruct the line of sight due to their dimensions. Drivers of other vehicles, including the ego car, should maintain a safe following distance, anticipate possible passenger-related stops, and be prepared for the bus to occupy more space while maneuvering.",
