It is a modified rickshaw or auto-cart with a partial enclosure and goods stacked on the back. The vehicle's size and the protruding cargo may compel the ego car to alter its lane or adjust its speed to keep a safe following distance since the vehicle could impede the traffic flow due to its slow movement and extra width.\n\nAdditionally, two individuals are associated with the three-wheeled vehicleâ€”one is seated, driving the vehicle, and the other is standing, attending to the load. Given their proximity to the roadway and the vehicle, they represent a potential hazard. Their presence requires the ego car to proceed with extra caution, possibly reducing speed to enhance safety.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic light ahead on the right side, showing red, and controlling the intersection. The ego car is required to decelerate and prepare to stop in response to the red light, following traffic rules.\n\nThe data indicates there are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene that would influence the driving behavior of the ego car."

Additionally, the car must approach the three-wheeled vehicle and pedestrian with caution, maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to stop or change lanes if the pedestrian's behavior or the position of the vehicle presents a hazard. The ego car should monitor the three-wheeled vehicle's behavior carefully and be prepared to adjust its trajectory or come to a complete stop to ensure safety for all road users. Decrease speed to allow for a longer reaction time due to the proximity of the three-wheeled vehicle and pedestrian. Monitor the pedestrian's behavior closely for any sudden movement towards the road. Prepare to stop due to the red traffic light and wet road conditions. Consider changing lanes if it is safe and the road ahead is clear, only if the actions of the three-wheeled vehicle and pedestrian allow for a safe maneuver. Given the observed road conditions and users, the ego car should begin to slow down in preparation for the red light ahead while keeping a safe following distance from the three-wheeled vehicle. The driver should stay alert to the individuals near the three-wheeled vehicle to ensure their safety and be prepared for their potential movements. Additionally, due to the wet road conditions, the ego car should approach the intersection with reduced speed to prevent skidding and maintain control during braking."
