The first vehicle is a parked car positioned on the right side of the lane with its hazard lights activated, which could be signaling a problem. Since it is partially obstructing the lane, it may necessitate careful navigation around it. The second vehicle is located to the front right and is distinguished by green lights, which could be for decoration or might indicate it's a service vehicle. The purpose of these lights is not certain, hence, extra caution should be exercised as the vehicle might make unexpected movements.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier has been placed directly ahead of the vehicle. It is a fence with reflective strips, likely indicating road work or a hazard ahead. The presence of the barrier will require a change in the driving path of the autonomous vehicle to ensure safe navigation around the area.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of parked vehicles on the right side, our vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop, ensuring that it does not obstruct the lanes used by emergency vehicles or other road users. Our vehicle should remain vigilant, watching for pedestrians or other road users who may be difficult to see at night. Drive carefully, maintain a low speed to cope with low visibility, wet road surfaces, and potential slippery conditions. Be ready to maneuver around obstacles and prepare to stop or yield at any moment in case those parked vehicles show signs of movement.",
