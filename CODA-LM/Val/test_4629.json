        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a white bus parked on the right side of the road ahead. The bus is currently stationary; however, it could commence movement, or passengers might alight from the bus, which would necessitate that the ego vehicle stay alert and be prepared to decelerate or come to a halt if needed. There are orange traffic cones set out along the right side of the road as well, signifying the presence of a worksite or some road obstruction. This situation is likely to reduce the available width of the road, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a position to the left. Additionally, temporary tall barriers are present on both sides of the road. These barriers obscure visibility and narrow down the road space, denoting that there is construction or some form of roadwork taking place, hence the ego vehicle must navigate the area with increased caution. Furthermore, the image does not feature any visible traffic lights, which implies that the ego vehicle should continue to travel following the rules of the road that apply to zones without traffic control signals. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

It is used to signal construction or roadwork areas, to funnel traffic into specific lanes, or to warn drivers of hazards or prohibited areas ahead. The presence of the traffic cone suggests that there may be some form of road obstruction or maintenance work ahead, which may require the driver of the ego car to slow down, exercise caution, and possibly change lanes to avoid the area marked by the cone.",
