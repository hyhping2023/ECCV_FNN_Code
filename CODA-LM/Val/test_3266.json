A black sedan is directly in front of the ego car with brake lights on, indicating it is either stopped or slowing down. This vehicle's status requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop.\n2. On the left side, there is a large truck with a green cylindrical mixer, likely a concrete mixer truck, either stationary or moving very slowly. The truck restricts the view ahead for the ego car and suggests limited maneuvering space on that side due to its size and lane position.\n3. A light blue van is parked on the side of the road to the right, beyond the black sedan. Although stationary, this van narrows the driving space and could pose a risk if passengers start exiting the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, metal guardrails are present on both sides of the road, limiting the lateral space available for the ego car. These guardrails create a confined space which may impact the ego car's ability to maneuver around obstacles or change lanes."

Overtaking is not advisable due to limited visibility ahead and the presence of heavy vehicles. The ego car should remain in the current lane and proceed with caution due to the confined space created by the guardrails. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to stop or yield, in case the sedan merges into the lane, and exercise caution due to the potential for pedestrians around the parked van and the cobblestone road surface. Monitoring for any indications from the truck and the sedan is important for proactive responding. No overtaking should be attempted without clear visibility and certainty of safe passing conditions."
