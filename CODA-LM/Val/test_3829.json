However, there is a vulnerable road user and a traffic sign that are noteworthy.\n\nA bicyclist is observed on the right side of the road, positioned ahead of our vehicle. The bicyclist is sharing the road space with other traffic. The presence of the bicyclist requires the autonomous vehicle to exercise caution while driving. It may need to adjust its speed or change its lane position to ensure a safe overtaking maneuver. Additionally, the vehicle must comply with local traffic laws, which may dictate a minimum distance that must be maintained from the bicyclist during overtaking.\n\nAdditionally, there is a warning sign on the right side of the road indicating that road construction is ahead. This sign alerts the autonomous vehicle to the possibility of potential hazards or alterations to the usual traffic flow. Consequently, the vehicle should be ready to decelerate or modify its driving path in response to the conditions suggested by the sign."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of a parked safety vehicle and cyclists on the right, our vehicle should be prepared to reduce speed or switch to the left lane when safe to do so. As there are no other road users in the adjacent lane, a smooth lane change should be possible. Continue to watch for any unexpected movements from the parked vehicles or cyclists, adhere to speed limits, and maintain a safe distance. Our vehicle should anticipate deceleration to handle construction zones and merging traffic. Activate the correct turn signal early to indicate the intention to merge left and pay close attention to the traffic conditions in the merging lane. Follow the warning signs and be ready at all times for sudden changes due to construction (such as workers or equipment entering the road).",
