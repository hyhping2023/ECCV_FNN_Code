        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene depicted, various road users and objects are highlighted that significantly influence driving behavior, specifically for the ego vehicle.\n\nA notable presence is a yellow-green ambulance positioned in the center of the image directly on the road. It is partially situated in the ego car's lane and is faced in the same travel direction. The position and orientation of the ambulance suggest that it might be moving slowly or has come to a halt due to an ongoing emergency situation. As a result, the ego car is required to either decelerate or prepare to navigate safely around the ambulance to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a blue rectangular traffic sign situated on the right side of the road, clearly displaying a speed limit of 30 km/h, marked with \"限速 30.\" The imposition of this speed limit is likely due to road construction activities hinted at by the presence of traffic cones. Thus, it is imperative for the ego car to obey this speed restriction both to comply with traffic laws and guarantee safe passage through the area affected by roadworks.\n\nComplementing the above is the deployment of multiple orange traffic cones along the right edge of the lane currently occupied by the ego vehicle. These cones effectively narrow down the lane and serve as indicators of a roadwork zone. The presence of these traffic cones underscores the necessity for the ego car to maintain a lowered speed and exhibit heightened caution while moving through the constrained space.\n\nThe traffic image does not include any other vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or additional objects requiring attention or affecting driving decisions for the ego vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the identified road users and conditions, the ego car should reduce its speed to comply with the 30 km/h speed limit sign and prepare for potentially slippery road conditions due to the snow. It should maintain vigilance for any sudden movements from the ambulance, in case it is active in an emergency response, and be prepared to carefully pass the ambulance while staying within the narrowed lane demarcated by the traffic cones."
