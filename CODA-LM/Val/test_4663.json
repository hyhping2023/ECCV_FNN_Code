        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, various road users and objects are captured which significantly influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle - the ego car.\n\nFirstly, a white van is parked on the left side of the road adjacent to a building. Although it is currently stationary, the ego car must be aware of its presence as it could potentially affect visibility and traffic flow. There is a risk of the van's doors opening suddenly or the vehicle pulling out unexpectedly, and the ego car needs to remain vigilant of these possibilities.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist in the image who is positioned in the middle of the road. The cyclist is pedaling a tricycle with a cart attached, which could lead to unpredictable movements or reduced speed. As cyclists are more vulnerable compared to vehicles, the ego car must exercise extra caution, slow down, and maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nMetal railings line the side of the road acting as a barrier between the sidewalk and the street. These barriers are essential for guiding the traffic flow and preventing pedestrians from crossing at potentially unsafe locations. The ego car should take into account that these barriers might indicate frequent pedestrian activity and remain alert for pedestrians who may appear at designated crossing points.\n\nLastly, several yellow bollards are positioned strategically between the driving lane and the metal railing barriers to the right side of the road, serving as a protection for both pedestrians and the barrier itself. However, due to their proximity to the driving lane, they could pose a hazard. The ego car needs to account for these bollards to avoid any potential collisions."
