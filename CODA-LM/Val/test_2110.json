A white truck is parked on the right side of the road facing away from the ego car, partially obstructing the curb-side lane. This truck's position may cause oncoming traffic to shift into the ego car's lane to pass it, creating a potential hazard. The ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop to allow oncoming vehicles to pass safely. Additionally, a small red car is driving in the distance ahead of the ego car in the same direction. This indicates that the road ahead is clear, but the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or turns.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are no visible traffic signs that directly influence the decisions of the ego car. In the absence of immediate road signs, standard road rules apply.\n\nFor traffic lights, there are no visible traffic lights in the image. Therefore, the ego car should proceed with default traffic rules, given the absence of traffic light instructions.\n\nA raised curb runs along the right side of the road, spanning the length visible in the image. This barrier prevents vehicles from parking too close to the road or driving onto the pedestrian way, contributing to road safety. The ego car should stay well within the lane to avoid the barrier."

Keep a safe following distance from the red car ahead and be prepared for its potential maneuvers. Stay within the marked lane, observing any possible changing positions of oncoming vehicles due to the parked truck. Continue at a speed appropriate for the road conditions and traffic laws. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the parked truck, ensuring sufficient clearance to prevent any potential sideswipe or mirror collisions. It should monitor the red car ahead for speed changes or turns. There are no immediate vulnerable road users present, so focus can remain on vehicular traffic. Since there are no traffic signs or signals dictating action, the ego car should proceed under general traffic laws, keeping within speed limits, and preparing for possible stops or turns as dictated by the road environment. Observing road barriers, the ego car should stay within marked lanes. The absence of any road hazards or adverse conditions suggests the ego car can proceed without adjustment for environmental factors."
