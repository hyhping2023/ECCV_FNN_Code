        "description and explanation": "In the image, there are several notable road users and elements affecting driving behavior. \n\nFirst, there are three vehicles present:\n1. A black sedan is positioned diagonally in the same lane as our car on the left side and traveling in the same direction. This positioning may indicate the sedan's intention to change lanes or make an imminent maneuver, requiring our vehicle to be cautious.\n2. A green bus ahead is stopped in the right lane with its hazard lights on, possibly due to a mechanical failure. This obstruction necessitates cars to change lanes for safe passage, if permitted.\n3. A silver small-sized van is stopped on the right side, facing the same direction as our vehicle. A man is standing by the open rear door, possibly dealing with a repair or loading/unloading goods. The open door and the person standing beside the van pose potential hazards to vehicles passing by at close range.\n\nAdditionally, there is one vulnerable road user:\n1. A man is standing next to the silver van, facing the rear of the vehicle, possibly performing maintenance or loading cargo. As a pedestrian closely adjacent to moving traffic, there is a risk of him accidentally entering the roadway, so our vehicle must be prepared.\n\nThere is also one traffic sign:\n1. A blue overhead sign, seemingly indicating lanes for exits or directions, possibly with information about the highway. If the route requires turning or changing lanes, the autonomous vehicle needs to merge into the correct lane in advance.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are visible in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should decelerate under safe and legal conditions and prepare to change lanes to the left to avoid the bus and the man standing next to the van. At the same time, a safe distance should be maintained from the black sedan on the left to prevent it from attempting to merge into the vehicle's lane. It is also necessary to be cautious of traffic cones and signs; the vehicle should safely maneuver around these obstacles. Overall, it is recommended to enhance alertness in such traffic situations and be ready to respond to the actions of other road users at any moment.",
