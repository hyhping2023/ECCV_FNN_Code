        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, we have observed several vehicles. Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a large green construction vehicle moving in the same direction as our vehicle. Drivers need to prepare to adjust their speed or change lanes if necessary to maintain a safe distance due to the vehicle's potential slow movement and large size, reducing the risk of sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white car situated right in front of our vehicle. This car is somewhat limiting our field of view, which in turn affects the speed and the following distance our self-driving vehicle must maintain.\n\nTo the front left, in the adjacent lane, we see a white SUV. This proximity and its relative speed present a possible risk of collision if the SUV were to execute any abrupt maneuvers. Close monitoring of the SUV's behavior is required to anticipate and react to any potential dangers.\n\nBesides the vehicles, we should note the presence of other elements in the road environment, such as traffic signals and power lines, and elevated road infrastructure. These elements should be acknowledged as part of the road surroundings but should not directly influence driving decisions."

Be prepared for the light-colored sedan on the right that might execute a right turn, adjusting your speed if necessary to facilitate its maneuver. Pay attention to changes in traffic lights or other traffic signs that may affect right-of-way or speed limits.",

The driver should be alert for possible indications of this vehicle merging or turning, which may disrupt the flow of traffic and require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes.",
