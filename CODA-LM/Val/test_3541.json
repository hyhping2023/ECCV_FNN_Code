Its red tail lights are illuminated, suggesting it is either slowing down or stopped. The truck appears to be making a left turn, with visible clearance lights and reflectors. This truck's position and movement are critical to the ego car's decision-making because it may take longer to clear the intersection, has a wide turning radius, and may hinder visibility ahead for the ego car driver, thereby restricting maneuverability.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are visible around the ego car, including cars with headlights on facing the ego car from the opposite direction of traffic, indicating active traffic. The presence of oncoming traffic necessitates the ego car to stay in its lane and be prepared for possible changes in traffic flow, as well as monitoring for any unexpected lane changes or maneuvers that could impact the ego car's path.\n\nA traffic light is also visible over the intersection, displaying a green light for the direction the ego car is facing, while the perpendicular traffic has a red light. The green traffic light signifies that the ego car has the right of way to proceed, but caution is advisable due to the large truck currently crossing the intersection and wet road conditions."

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the oncoming traffic to stay informed about the flow of traffic and be prepared to stop or yield if the truck's movement through the intersection is slower than anticipated. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead to ensure sufficient reaction time and stopping distance, especially given the wet road conditions. Monitor the oncoming traffic for any erratic movement and be prepared to react accordingly. Continue to observe the traffic lights and be ready to stop if they change, but proceed if the way remains clear and the lights stay green. Given the presence of the large truck blocking the lane ahead and the green traffic light, the ego car should reduce speed and prepare to either stop or change lanes if it is safe to do so. The driver should check the side mirrors and blind spots before any lane change to ensure it is safe from the side traffic."
