These traffic cones indicate a clear boundary not to be crossed, which could suggest restricted area access or the presence of a checkpoint. Additionally, there's a red and white striped boom barrier lowered across the road, preventing vehicles from passing through, with two traffic cones placed beside itâ€”one on each side of the road. This boom barrier indicates the road is currently closed to vehicular traffic, possibly due to a controlled entry point, temporary roadworks, or an event. Furthermore, an LED sign is mounted on a post to the left of the ego vehicle, displaying a red text message. Although the exact text is illegible, such LED signs typically carry important information about road status, diversions, or instructions that drivers need to comply with."

It is typically used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, but it can also be used to mark off areas or to reserve space. The traffic cone is designed to be highly visible and is often colored with bright colors like orange, with white bands for better visibility at night or in poor light conditions. Their influence on the future driving behavior of the ego car would be significant as they dictate the safe path of travel, often indicating that the driver must maneuver around the coned-off area.",
