        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene includes various road users and potential obstacles. On the left side, there's a brown multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) that is coming to a stop with its rear facing our vehicle. This and another white vehicle on the right side of the road, which is also facing our vehicle, could become moving obstacles and might block lanes or cause our vehicle to make sudden stops. Additionally, there are several parked cars on the left side of the road, which could narrow the driving space and create a situation where vehicles or pedestrians might unexpectedly cross the road. A white van is seen driving opposite to our vehicle's direction, and due to its size and movement, it has the potential to block the view of other road users or pedestrians. On the right, there's a white car parked diagonally, appearing to make a U-turn, which could suggest the presence of unforeseen obstacles or the vehicle's intention to park.\n\nWe also have a vulnerable road user in the scene; a pedestrian is standing among the parked vehicles on the left, just in front of our car. The pedestrian might step onto the driving lane at any moment, therefore our vehicle must remain alert and ready to stop or slow down.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the scene, suggesting that they aren't present or don't play a significant role in this particular driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the possibility of pedestrians crossing the road, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop. Meanwhile, be vigilant of the movements of the brown multi-purpose vehicle on the left, as it may suddenly join the flow of traffic. The vehicle should proceed with caution when circumventing parked vehicles, paying close attention to the opening of car doors or pedestrians suddenly entering the roadway. In light of the various situations at hand, it is advisable to adopt defensive driving and be ready to stop or maneuver at any moment. Maintain a safe following distance in case the vehicle ahead comes to an abrupt stop, and be prepared to yield to road users crossing the street. Extra care is also necessary due to the slippery road conditions.",
