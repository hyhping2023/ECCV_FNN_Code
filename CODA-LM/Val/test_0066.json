This traffic condition requires self-driving cars to adapt to potential slow-moving or stop-and-go traffic. Additionally, a bus is directly ahead in the same lane, which may lead to sudden stops due to frequent passenger drop-offs and pickups. A white police car is parked on the roadside to the left, indicating there might be an incident or law enforcement action ahead, possibly necessitating sudden stops or detours. On the adjacent lane to the left, several cars are moving in the opposite direction parallel to our vehicle, which could affect lane maneuverability or result in vehicles attempting to merge.\n\nA traffic sign located on the left prohibits the entry of tour buses, suggesting that travel coaches may unexpectedly change lanes or stop. The traffic light displays a red \"50,\" perhaps signifying speed limit enforcement or a bus-specific stop requirement, prompting the vehicle to potentially adjust speed or prepare to halt.\n\nFinally, on the right side of the road, there are barriers marked with red and white stripes, narrowing the navigable road space and influencing lane positioning for safety. No vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other types of objects are present in the image."

Stay within the marked lanes, and pay attention to cones that may indicate roadwork or obstacles. Keep a safe distance behind buses, being alert for sudden stops. Avoid no-parking zones on the left and be prepared for pedestrian activity around bus stops. Follow the guidance of traffic cones. Drive at the speed limit indicated by signs on the right. Monitor changes in traffic signals and be ready to adjust your speed or stop if necessary. Stay vigilant for potential lane changes from vehicles in adjacent lanes, and ensure a safe distance from obstacles on the right.",
