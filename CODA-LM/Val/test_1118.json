This vehicle requires monitoring in case it makes unexpected maneuvers, such as sudden braking or lane changing.\n   - A stationary red truck is parked on the left side of the road before a pedestrian crossing. This truck reduces the usable width of the left lane and may cause other vehicles to merge into the ego car's lane to avoid it, posing a potential risk.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - No vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are visible in the image. No immediate action is required regarding vulnerable road users; however, caution is advised near the pedestrian crossing.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A blue direction sign is seen high above the road on the right, indicating directions for upcoming roads or locations. It provides information for navigation but does not require any immediate action.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - No traffic lights are visible in the image, so there is no need for action regarding traffic light signals at this moment.\n\n5. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Yellow and black traffic cones are placed on the left side, marking the area beside the stationary red truck, indicating road work or an obstacle ahead. These cones serve as a warning to the ego car to avoid entering the left lane and to be prepared for potential obstructions or workers near the vehicle lane."

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone which serves as a temporary traffic control device. It has a bright orange color with a reflective band to increase visibility. Traffic cones are often used to guide traffic around a temporary hazard or to safely channel vehicles along a particular route when any part of the road is under construction or temporarily blocked for some reason. In this scenario, the presence of a traffic cone in the driving environment signifies that there may be a potential hazard or change in driving conditions ahead, and the ego car should prepare to alter its course by slowing down or changing lanes if necessary to maintain a safe driving environment.",

As the ego car approaches the pedestrian crossing and the parked truck, it should slow down and be prepared to stop for pedestrians, especially as the truck may obscure visibility. Anticipate potential movements from hidden pedestrians. Lane changes should be conducted with caution and only if necessary, after checking for clear road conditions. Maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, monitor its movements, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary. Exercise caution and possibly move slightly to the right within the lane to safely pass the parked truck while checking for any possible pedestrian movement. Follow the lane markings and obey any upcoming directional signs as needed for navigation. Do not attempt to use the left lane as the stationary red truck and traffic cones indicate it is not fully available. Continue to monitor the sides of the road for any other potential hazards or changes in road conditions."
