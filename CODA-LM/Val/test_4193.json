It should be prepared to stop or maneuver around the vehicle if necessary, watching for any signal from the construction vehicle's operator. As the road signs are not clear, the driver or autonomous system should remain vigilant for any changes in road conditions or instructions as they approach. Stay on the lookout for any construction-related directions or personnel directing traffic. Proceed with caution and be prepared to either slow down or change lanes if the utility vehicle is stationary or moving slowly. Observe any posted traffic signs and be ready to comply with any changes in traffic regulations or road conditions that they may indicate."
