        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image provided, there are several road users and objects that the vehicle must consider:\n\n1. **Vehicles**:\n   - There is a white bus on the left side of the road, parallel to our vehicle. This bus appears to be stopping or moving slowly, possibly picking up or dropping off passengers, and may merge into traffic or open its doors without warning.\n   - A black sedan is traveling in the same direction as our car, in the lane to the left of our vehicle. Drivers must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the sedan's potential braking or turning maneuvers.\n   - A yellow crane truck is loading cargo on the right side of the vehicle and is traveling in a parallel lane in the same direction as our vehicle. It is crucial to monitor the truck to ensure it remains in its lane and to be alert for any debris that might fall from its load.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A motorcyclist is right behind the black sedan on the left, facing the same direction as our vehicle. Motorcyclists are more vulnerable to injuries and harder to detect than drivers of larger vehicles. It is important to maintain a sufficient distance, exercise caution when changing lanes, and pay close attention to the motorcyclist's movements.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - On the right side, there is a green construction railing, which separates the road from the construction area. This indicates the presence of a construction area, and there may be workers or machinery entering the road, so heightened vigilance is necessary.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - Although there are no obstacles like fragments or trash cans on the path of the vehicle, the cargo carried by the crane truck might drop rocks on the road. It is necessary for self-driving vehicles to maintain a safe distance from cranes to avoid potential hazards from falling rocks."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the black sedan and monitor for any signs of movement from the white bus. Approach with particular caution since the crane truck may move slowly and there is a risk of stones falling onto the road. Extra space and attention should be given to motorcyclists due to their vulnerability and potential for unpredictable movements. Construction obstacles indicate that there may be road work, therefore be prepared for sudden changes in traffic patterns. Overall, it is recommended to adopt safe driving habits, including appropriate speed and distance, to safely handle traffic conditions.",

            "description and explanation": "A large public transportation vehicle designed to carry multiple passengers along a predetermined route. It significantly affects the traffic flow as it may make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers, and may also pull into and out of traffic more often than typical vehicles. As a result, other vehicles, including the ego car, need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow-downs initiated by the bus.",

Due to its size and the nature of its operation, it could impact traffic patterns by necessitating wider turns, moving slower than normal traffic, and potentially making sudden stops. Other vehicles, like the ego car, should give it more clearance and be vigilant of unexpected movements or the presence of construction zones that might warrant reduced speeds or detours.",
