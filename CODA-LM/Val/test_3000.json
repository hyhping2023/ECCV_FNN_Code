It has bright warning markings and a flashing arrow sign directed to the left, indicating that the vehicle is possibly stationary or moving slowly.",
                "explanation": "This construction vehicle is considerably larger and potentially slower than standard traffic, which may lead to a reduction in the available lanes for maneuvering and require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes."

        "description and explanation": "The scene includes a large green construction vehicle, a black sedan, and a distinct white truck along with an overhead green directional sign and a series of barriers.\n\nThe large green construction vehicle is located in the center lane ahead of our vehicle, moving in the same direction as we are. It is marked by bright warning signals and a flashing arrow urging a lane change to the left, suggesting it might be stationary or slow-moving. This vehicle's size and speed necessitate our car to possibly adjust its velocity or change lanes to avoid it safely.\n\nAdjacent to our vehicle, in the left lane and slightly head of us, is a black sedan traveling parallel on the same trajectory. The proximity of the sedan may influence our decisions regarding lane changes, particularly because we might need to circumvent the construction vehicle.\n\nAlthough visible, a white truck on the overpass above does not affect our immediate driving decisions, as it is not on the same roadway.\n\nAn overhead green directional sign, located on the right side just before the overpass, informs drivers about lane specifications for the upcoming exits or roadways. This sign is crucial for navigating properly and making informed decisions about lane changes or taking an exit if required.\n\nFurthermore, there are a series of green barriers positioned on the right side delineating the road from an exit ramp. These barriers restrict the space available on the road, having the potential to influence maneuvering decisions, including lane changes or taking an exit.\n\nThis overview summarizes the current road conditions and the potential challenges they present to the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior."

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy-duty construction vehicle, possibly a concrete mixer truck, evidenced by the distinctive shape of the mixing drum at the rear. The vehicle's presence requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be attentive to any potential changes in speed or lane position by the construction vehicle. It may make wide or sudden turns, or require additional space to maneuver due to its size. The ego car should be prepared to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary to ensure safety and maintain traffic flow.",

Be cautious of the black sedan in the left lane to ensure a safe lane change. Stay aware of overhead road signs for upcoming exits or lane changes, and do not attempt to cross onto the exit ramp due to the presence of green barriers. The ego vehicle should prepare to change lanes to the left to safely overtake the construction vehicle ahead. Before changing lanes, the driver should check the mirrors and blind spots, and signal appropriately to alert other drivers. If the speed of the construction vehicle is significantly slower, the ego vehicle should execute the lane change promptly but safely, being mindful of the dark-colored sedan in the adjacent lane. It is important to also keep a look out for any potential signs of construction ahead or other irregularities on the road that may affect the traffic flow."
