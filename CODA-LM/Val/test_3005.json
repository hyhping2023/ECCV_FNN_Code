Thereâ€™s a large construction vehicle ahead in the lane, which appears to be slightly skewed towards the ego vehicle's lane with a visible load over its rear section that suggests it might be in motion. The presence of this construction vehicle poses a potential obstruction along the ego vehicle's path. The ego car may need to reduce speed or change lanes to maintain safe passage due to the vehicle's size and its position on the road, which could also result in unpredictable movements. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."

Its presence indicates that there may be construction activity nearby. Consequently, the driver of the ego car should proceed with caution, anticipating potential roadblocks, detours, or the presence of construction workers, and should be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary.",

Pay attention for any signals from the construction vehicle indicating a turn or stop, and observe for any additional road signs or signals that may require action. The ego vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to stop or steer safely to the right to avoid the construction vehicle if it encroaches further into the car's lane. Being prepared for unexpected movements from the construction vehicle and maintaining a safe following distance are also advisable. If the road ahead is clear and it is safe to do so, the ego vehicle might also consider safely passing the construction vehicle, but only if the adjacent lane is clear and it is legal to pass. Constant vigilance is required to react to the actions of the construction vehicle."
