        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, two categories of road users are notable: vehicles and, implicitly, no presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, as those categories are empty. \n\nThe vehicles category comprises a white camper van and parked vehicles along the road. The white camper van is situated on the right side of the ego vehicle, facing it, and partially obstructs the lane. This positioning of the camper van necessitates cautious driving from the ego vehicle, likely requiring a reduction in speed or a lane change to ensure safe passage due to the reduced lane width available for maneuvering. Additionally, vehicles are parked on both sides of the roadway, resulting in a narrowed path that limits the ability of the ego vehicle to navigate easily. The presence of parked vehicles on both sides demands careful driving to accommodate for potential oncoming traffic in scenarios where the road does not allow for two vehicles to pass each other simultaneously, possibly necessitating a reduced speed to safely navigate the constrained space. \n\nThis summary captures the essence of the presented traffic situation and the need for adjusted driving behavior in response to the described road conditions and vehicle placements."

Due to its size and the location where it's parked, it may restrict visibility for the driver of the ego car, requiring extra caution when driving past. The driver should reduce speed and stay vigilant for pedestrians who might walk around the vehicle, as well as for other cars potentially pulling out from behind it.",

It should also increase the following distance to any vehicles ahead for added safety due to reduced traction. The ego vehicle should continuously monitor for any movement from the camper van as well as oncoming traffic due to the narrow driving path resulting from the parked vehicles."
