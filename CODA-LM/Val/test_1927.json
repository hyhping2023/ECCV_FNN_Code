The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or turns that the truck might make. Its potentially shedding load presents hazards that can impact visibility and road conditions."

The truck's brake lights are on, indicating it might be slowing down or preparing to stop. Due to its size and position, the truck could obstruct the ego car’s view of the road ahead, making it challenging to respond to traffic changes or obstacles. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be ready for any sudden stops or turns by the truck, noting that a potential load shedding from the truck poses additional hazards.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a reflective road sign with unclear specific information that may contain vital traffic regulation details impacting the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nAdditionally, there is significant dirt or debris on the windshield, potentially impairing the driver’s visibility. This reduced visibility could hinder the driver’s ability to make informed decisions, observe traffic signs, and spot other road users promptly, underscoring the importance of clear visibility for safe driving.\n\nLastly, there are overhead power lines parallel to the road. Although they are a standard roadside feature, they do not directly influence driving behavior."

This type of vehicle is typically slow-moving when fully loaded and can interfere with the flow of traffic due to its size and operational requirement.

Also, keep an eye on the reflective road sign for any changes to traffic patterns or regulations as it becomes visible, and follow any directives it may indicate. Continue to monitor the truck's indicators for any sudden turns or stops and be prepared to react accordingly. Consider using windshield wipers or washer fluid to clear the debris for better visibility."
