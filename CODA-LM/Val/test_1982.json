The illuminated taillights indicate that these vehicles might slow down, come to a standstill, or switch lanes, affecting the decisions our autonomous car must make.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones visible, characterized by their yellow and black colors with reflective surfaces, positioned ahead near a gap in the central reservation. The placement of these cones suggests that a part of the road could be closed or in an unsafe condition possibly due to ongoing construction, signaling that it is not appropriate for vehicles to drive through that area.\n\nMoreover, reflective barriers with yellow and black patterns are installed, which are restricting access to a section of the road or openings in the central divider. These barriers serve to guide drivers by indicating a diversion in the road or a lane closure, which necessitates extra caution for safe navigation.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are present in the scene, according to the data provided."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the slippery road conditions, it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed to ensure a safe stopping distance and be prepared to merge left if needed, according to the arrangement of cone-shaped signs and obstacles ahead. Drivers should also be alert to any additional directional signs or signals to confirm the correct path. Because of the low visibility and wet road surface, it is wise to maintain a cautious speed and increase the following distance from the vehicle ahead. Since the traffic lights may not be visible, drivers should pay close attention to the behavior of vehicles ahead and be ready to respond accordingly. Moreover, obstacles on the left side of the road indicate that if the left lane ahead is closed, merging right or following detour signs might be required.",
