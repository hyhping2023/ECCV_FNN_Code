        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a notable presence of parked cars on both sides of the road. One particular car, possibly a white sedan, is very close to the lane on the right side. The presence of these parked vehicles significantly reduces the navigable width of the road for the ego vehicle. It also heightens the risk as these cars may obscure pedestrians or other potential hazards from the driver's view.\n\nDespite the congested parking situation, there are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists visibly present in the scene. This absence means there are no immediate risks of this nature that need to be navigated by the autonomous vehicle at this moment.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, the scene is devoid of any visible instructions or warnings. This lack of signage indicates that standard road rules are in force, and no specific additional considerations or adjustments in driving behavior are required based on unusual or specific road conditions signaled by such signs.\n\nSimilarly, traffic lights are not present in the immediate field of view. The autonomous system should hence default to following right-of-way rules applicable to uncontrolled intersections or road sections without traffic light control, ensuring safe and legal navigation of the vehicle under standard driving conditions.\n\nHowever, there is a sighting of a pair of green traffic cones on the right side of the road. These cones may suggest the presence of upcoming road work, a temporary hazard, or a road narrowing ahead. Caution is advised in this area, potentially necessitating a reduction in speed and enhanced vigilance to safely navigate through or around the potential obstruction or condition indicated by the cones.\n\nNo barriers are visible in the scene, affirming that there are no physical obstructions or reroutes that need to be navigated around, and the road layout remains as expected for the path of the vehicle. \n\nLastly, the absence of other objects such as debris or dustbins in the road implies a clear path ahead, minimizing the risk of unpredictable maneuvers or the need for sudden adjustments in the vehicle's course. This clarity in the driving path is conducive to a smooth and safe driving experience in the current observation."
