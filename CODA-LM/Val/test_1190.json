A three-wheeled delivery vehicle positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the center of the drivable lane. This vehicle affects the ego car due to its slower speed, potentially disrupting traffic flow and making sudden movements as part of delivery operations.\n  2. Various parked cars are present on both sides of the street, some with drivers inside. These cars pose a hazard as they might open doors or pull out into traffic unexpectedly, requiring the ego vehicle to exercise increased caution and readiness to react.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: \n  1. A pedestrian wearing yellow appears to be crossing the street in front of the three-wheeled vehicle and closer to the ego car. Pedestrians can be unpredictable and may enter the road, necessitating that the ego car slow down or stop to ensure safety.\n  2. Cyclists are seen on the right, closer to the curbside, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. These cyclists share the road and the ego car must ensure sufficient space when passing and be cautious of any changes in the cyclistsâ€™ positions.\n\n- **Other Objects**: \n  There are green dustbins to the right of the road, adjacent to the parked vehicles. While these objects do not directly affect driving behavior, they should be noted in case they are moved onto the road or blown over.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."
