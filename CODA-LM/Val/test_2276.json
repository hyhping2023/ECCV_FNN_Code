This cone is typically used to mark off areas or delineate space on roadways to guide vehicles and prevent them from entering hazardous or off-limit zones. The presence of this cone suggests that there may be road work ahead, an obstruction, or an area that is unsafe for vehicles, and thus, the ego car should prepare to slow down, proceed with caution, or potentially change lanes if necessary to maintain a safe driving environment.",
