A yellow crane occupies the rightmost lane, with part of its structure extending into the adjacent lane, posing an immediate obstacle and requiring vehicles to maneuver around it. Behind the crane, a red truck is partially visible, indicating possible construction or equipment transport activities that could influence driving conditions.\n\nA person stands on the elevated platform of the crane, and another is by a row of parked bicycles on the sidewalk. While the person on the crane is not an immediate concern for drivers, caution is still necessary. The individual on the sidewalk, close to a crosswalk, may potentially walk onto the street, prompting drivers to be vigilant.\n\nAlthough the image lacks any traffic signs that directly impact the ego car's driving behavior, standard road rules still apply, and the absence of traffic lights mandates adherence to typical traffic regulations and the consideration of right-of-way.\n\nTraffic cones, specifically yellow and black ones, surround the crane's base and invade the driving lane to mark the work zone, which requires drivers to either change lanes or slow their speed. Concrete barriers are also present, creating a physical division between the traffic lane and the work zone, guiding vehicles away and indicating a no-entry area.\n\nLastly, orange pylons are positioned near the crane stabilizers to alert road users to the boundaries of the work zone, serving as a visual warning to avoid the area and thus promoting roadway safety."
