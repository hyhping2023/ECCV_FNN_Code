There are two vehicles on the right side of the image: a white sedan parked partially obstructing a lane and a blue truck with a tarpaulin-covered cargo parked further away, facing away from the ego car. The white sedan may affect traffic flow due to its positioning, narrowing the lane, while the blue truck could limit maneuverability and obscure the view of potential hazards.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, a person is standing between the white sedan and the blue truck, seemingly engaged in construction or maintenance work. This individual poses a potential risk by possibly entering the roadway unexpectedly, requiring the ego car to be ready to stop or slow down.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a construction excavator indicates possible road work or obstacles, necessitating caution and potential adjustments in the travel path due to the disruptions or hazards posed by the construction activity.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple small miscellaneous objects scattered on the ground behind the white car. The debris constitutes a driving hazard, and the ego car should maneuver around them safely."
