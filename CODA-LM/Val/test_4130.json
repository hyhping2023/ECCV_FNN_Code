        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a notable presence of a large orange mobile crane truck positioned several vehicles ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction. The significant size of the crane truck is a critical factor as it may obstruct the driver's view of the road ahead. Consequently, it is advisable to increase the following distance when behind such a large vehicle to ensure there is adequate stopping time, enhancing safety on the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue highway sign visible ahead on the right side, suspended high on a post. This sign is particularly important as it provides route information that could be essential for drivers who plan to take an upcoming exit or are navigating according to a specific route. The presence of this sign aids in making informed decisions about lane changes or exits well in advance, contributing to smoother traffic flow and reducing the likelihood of last-minute lane changes."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance when following a large crane truck, as its size and potential to block the line of sight on the road requires a longer following distance. Observe the behavior of vehicles in the left lane to be prepared for sudden changes or stops. Plan your lane changes or exits by watching the blue signs ahead. Continuously evaluate the road conditions and maintain an appropriate speed for dry roads. Be ready for the truck's possible deceleration or stopping, and pay attention to any signals indicating the truck might turn or change lanes. Since there are no traffic lights, cones, or obstacles, continue to monitor the road conditions and be aware of oncoming traffic. Practice defensive driving, anticipating possible hazards and the actions of other vehicles.",
