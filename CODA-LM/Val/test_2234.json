This requires the autonomous vehicle to be prepared to decelerate and possibly stop.\n\nAt the intersection's left side is a group of motorcyclists and cyclists waiting in front of the vehicles, necessitating vigilant monitoring by the autonomous vehicle, ready to react promptly to their sudden movements.\n\nAlso on the left, a person is riding a bicycle in the opposing direction of travel, mandating a safe distance be kept and readiness to change lanes or reduce speed to prevent close encounters.\n\nDirectly ahead, the sightline is dominated by a red traffic light instructing vehicles to halt and await a green signal.\n\nLastly, there's a temporary fence along the left side of the road delineating a construction zone from the usable street. This barrier could mean a narrower driving space or a deviation from the usual traffic pattern, which would need to be maneuvered around carefully.\n\nIt's important to note that there are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects in this scene that would impact the driving strategy."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should proceed straight in accordance with the traffic signal lights. Due to the presence of vulnerable road users and potential congestion, it is necessary to maintain a cautious speed. It is important to be alert to a dark-colored car turning left to prevent it from changing direction suddenly and affecting our vehicle's path. Exercise caution when overtaking bicycles ahead, and maintain an adequate lateral clearance. Given there are obstacles on the right, our vehicle should be prepared to adjust its lane position to accommodate any changes. Continuous situational awareness is key, as the behavior of road users can be dynamic and unpredictable in an urban traffic environment. Approach the intersection cautiously and be ready to stop in case the traffic lights indicate the need to do so. Pay close attention to the traffic lights to recognize signal changes. Proceed only when the light turns green, ensuring that pedestrians and motorcyclists are not in the intersection, and after giving priority to any vulnerable road users who may be crossing. If our vehicle is approaching the intersection, stop and wait until the traffic signal facing you is clearly visible and indicates it is safe to proceed. Monitor the black sedan in front and be prepared to yield if necessary. Additionally, be cautious of motorcyclists and bicyclists who may cross or enter our path upon signal changes. Confirming the status of the signal for your direction of travel is crucial for safely navigating the intersection.",
