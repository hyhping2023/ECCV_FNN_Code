Along both sides of the road, an assortment of parked cars is observed, with a denser cluster on the left, which reduces the width of the road and may conceal pedestrians or other vehicles as they pull out.\n\nOn the right-hand sidewalk, pedestrians are visible, one being notably close to the crosswalk, presenting a need for caution as they might step onto the street. Additionally, a bicyclist is spotted at a distance on the right, traveling the same way as our vehicle, who might present a hazard if they enter the driving lanes.\n\nThe image includes overhead traffic signs that give directions for the lanes, providing guidance for autonomous vehicles on lane selection for continued travel or highway exits. Meanwhile, the traffic light positioned ahead displays green, signaling the ability to proceed while still necessitating alertness to lighting changes and other road conditions.\n\nOrange traffic cones on the right side of our lane suggest possible dangers or a lane closure ahead, which could mean a mandatory lane change. On the left sidewalk, there are parked bicycles that, although static, could become unpredictable hazards if disturbed by pedestrians, requiring attentiveness.\n\nThe data does not mention any barriers or other road user elements that would influence the autonomous driving scenario, indicating their absence from the scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "When the green light comes on, the vehicle should continue to move forward, but because of the slippery road conditions, it is necessary to carefully control the speed and maintain a safe distance from the red truck ahead. If the motorcycle on the right changes lanes, the vehicle should be prepared to yield and pay close attention to pedestrians to prevent them from stepping onto the crosswalk. In addition, the vehicle should also watch out for vehicles parked on the side of the road and potential obstacles or vehicles that may suddenly appear from between parked vehicles. The presence of traffic cones indicates the need to be aware of possible road work or hazards. A safe distance must be kept from cyclists, and if a cyclist enters the traffic path, the vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop. The vehicle should also monitor the oncoming black car to prevent any unexpected movements. When passing through parking areas, reduce speed and be alert for car doors opening or pedestrians suddenly stepping into the street. The wet road conditions require reducing speed and increasing the following distance to accommodate the longer braking distance required. At the same time, since the traffic cones suggest that there may be obstacles ahead, the vehicle should be prepared to merge left if necessary while still maintaining a safe distance from surrounding traffic.",

It is a cone-shaped marker that is usually orange and white, providing high visibility. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there might be roadwork, an obstruction, or a special event causing a deviation in the normal flow of traffic. As a result, the ego car should be prepared to slow down, proceed with caution, or possibly follow a detour, depending on additional signage or instructions from traffic control personnel.",
