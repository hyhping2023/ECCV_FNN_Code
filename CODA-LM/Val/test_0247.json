        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several notable road users and objects affecting the movement and decision-making processes of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there is a blue and white bus stopped on the right side of the two-lane road ahead, facing the ego vehicle. The presence of the bus suggests it might be engaged in passenger activities, implying potential pedestrian movement near the road and the possibility of the bus merging back into traffic, necessitating caution from the ego vehicle. Behind the bus, several cars are parked along the right side of the road, which narrows the drivable space and may conceal pedestrians attempting to cross the road from between these vehicles.\n\nOn the left lane, a line of vehicles is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, impacting the ego vehicle's traveling speed and possible lane changes due to their movement. Additionally, a cyclist is observed next to the parked cars on the right, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The cyclist's position demands that the ego vehicle maintain a safe following distance and remain alert to any sudden moves the cyclist might make.\n\nNearby, pedestrians are seen in the vicinity of the parked cars and the bus, either standing or walking. Their proximity to the roadway presents a risk of them stepping onto the road unexpectedly, requiring the ego vehicle to adopt a cautious speed and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nMoreover, traffic cones have been placed on the right side of the road to delineate the boundary between the driving lane and the area occupied by the bus and parked cars. These cones signify a reduction in road width, compelling the ego vehicle to stay within its lane and stay observant of the diminished roadway.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects contributing to the driving conditions. This summary encapsulates all the relevant details provided in the scene, highlighting the interaction between different road users and objects and their impact on the behavior of the ego vehicle."
