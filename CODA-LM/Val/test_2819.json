This sedan requires my car to maintain an appropriate following distance and adjust speed accordingly to ensure safe driving conditions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, reflective traffic cones are placed, indicating the flow of traffic and possibly suggesting the closing or shifting of the traffic lanes. These cones guide my car on where to drive and to be alert for potential changes in the lane patterns.\n\nAdditionally, yellow barriers are also present on the right side of the road, signaling that the road may be closed or under construction. These barriers require my car to drive with increased caution and preparedness to merge left if necessary to continue to navigate safely through the traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image, implying that these elements do not impact the driving behavior of my autonomous vehicle at this time."

For the ego car, encountering a traffic cone would necessitate a reduction in speed and possibly a change in direction to ensure a safe distance is maintained from the designated work zone or obstacle.",
