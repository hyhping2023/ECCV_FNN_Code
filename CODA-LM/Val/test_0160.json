This sedan is crucial for the ego car's driving decisions, as it dictates whether to follow, overtake, or keep a safe distance. To the right, a three-wheeled cargo vehicle is moving parallel to the sedan, and its presence means the ego car might need to change lanes or adjust speed to maintain safety. Ahead of the white sedan, another motor tricycle is moving in the same direction, requiring the ego car to monitor its speed and trajectory closely.\n\nA pedestrian in blue is crossing the street in front of the white sedan, and the ego car must yield to them, ensuring they cross safely before proceeding. Additionally, a motorcyclist wearing a blue jacket is ahead and to the right of the ego car, crossing the intersection. The ego car needs to be particularly vigilant of the motorcycle due to its speed and smaller size, which makes it less visible.\n\nOverhead, there are directional signs indicating lane directions, although the specific instructions are not clear from this perspective. These signs are essential for the ego car to determine the correct lane and direction at the intersection. The traffic light is green, signaling that traffic can proceed, but the ego car must still yield to other vehicles and pedestrians already in the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The ego car should also pay attention to the overhead signs to ensure that it is in the correct lane to follow its intended route through the intersection. All movements should be done with caution to ensure safety for all road users involved."
