        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario described includes a variety of road users and objects that the ego vehicle must navigate around. In the same lane as the autonomous vehicle, there is a black sedan moving in the same direction, requiring a safe following distance to be maintained. Further ahead in the same lane, several vehicles contribute to the traffic flow, dictating the speed and stopping patterns for the ego car. A white van on the right side could be stopped or parked, posing potential activity the ego vehicle should monitor.\n\nIn the oncoming traffic lane, motorcyclists are moving towards the ego vehicle. Their proximity to the center lane necessitates caution from the autonomous car. To the right, a parked white sedan and a small truck require vigilance for any sudden movements like doors opening or potential unloading. Ahead in the same lane, a light-colored vehicle's actions are crucial for anticipating changes in traffic flow. Additionally, several vehicles on the opposite lane are moving in the opposite direction, reminding the ego vehicle to maintain lateral safety distance.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist on the right near parked vehicles who might need to maneuver into the travel lane. A pedestrian is also on the right side of the road near the parked vehicles, posing a potential crossing hazard. Another pedestrian in a red top stands focused on the road on the sidewalk to the right, whose intentions are unclear and require monitoring. Finally, there's another cyclist on the left heading in the opposite direction of the ego vehicle, demanding awareness in case of unexpected crossings or swerves.\n\nAs for road infrastructure changes, orange traffic cones on the left indicate a transition to the right lane for the ego car, due to a merge or blocked-off area. A temporary yellow and black barrier further reinforces that there's a closed-off area or roadwork ahead, influencing lane-choice behavior. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Therefore, the ego car should signal right, check for a safe gap in the adjacent lane, and merge smoothly, while being cautious of the road surface conditions due to dirt and debris."
