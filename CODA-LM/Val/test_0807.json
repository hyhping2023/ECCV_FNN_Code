                "explanation": "The crane truck's position slightly encroaches on the driving lane, which could restrict the available space for the ego car and other traffic to maneuver safely. Since the crane's arm extends over a part of its lane, it may influence the lane choice and clearance distance that the ego car needs to maintain to ensure safe passage."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large yellow crane truck situated on the right side of the ego car. It is placed partially on the road and partially on the shoulder, facing the same direction as the ego car. The crane's arm is extended upwards. The positioning of the crane truck could potentially restrict the available space for the ego car and other traffic to maneuver safely, and the extended crane arm over the lane may influence the ego car's lane choice and the clearance distance needed to pass safely.\n\nFurthermore, there are overhead directional traffic signs that are visible to the ego car. They indicate lanes leading to Jinxing Ave and Yuehai Ave with arrows pointing to the right, signaling an upcoming intersection where these routes are accessible. These signs are crucial as they inform drivers, including the ego car, about the approaching junction and the subsequent actions required, such as changing lanes to reach the chosen route for navigation. \n\nOther categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, do not feature any items in this image and thus do not need consideration in the driving decisions for this particular scenario."

Due to its large size and potential for wide turning movements, the presence of this vehicle on or near the roadway suggests the driver of the ego car should exercise caution, allow for extra space in case the vehicle makes unexpected maneuvers, and be prepared for possible traffic delays or detours caused by construction activity.",

Be prepared for any abrupt maneuvers by the crane truck. Additionally, stay alert for the upcoming intersection as indicated by the directional signs and plan a lane change if necessary to follow the desired route. Monitor the road ahead for any other signs or traffic lights that may come into view to inform further driving actions. Prepare to adjust lane position based on the intended route as indicated by the overhead signs. Reduce speed appropriately due to wet road conditions to allow for increased stopping distances."
