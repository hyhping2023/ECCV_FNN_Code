These cones are commonly used as temporary markers to direct traffic or signal changes in road layouts, such as during construction work or after an incident. For the ego car, the presence of this cone would necessitate a change in driving behavior to avoid the area that the cone is marking off, often indicating that the driver should move over to an adjacent lane or adjust their path to steer clear of the marked zone.",
