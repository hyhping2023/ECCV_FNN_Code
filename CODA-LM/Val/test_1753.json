The autonomous vehicle must consider this vehicle's behavior to decide whether to continue driving or yield, as it could be entering the road or just stopping by the roadside.\n\nAdditionally, a group of pedestrians is crossing the road ahead, occupying both lanes of the autonomous vehicle's path. They are moving from the right to the left side of the road. Given that it is nighttime and the lighting conditions are poor, visibility is reduced, which heightens the need for the autonomous vehicle to take immediate action to ensure the safety of the pedestrians.\n\nFurthermore, there is a raised central divider or obstacle on the right side of the vehicle, which serves to separate the oncoming traffic lanes. This barrier indicates that the lane is divided, and the autonomous vehicle should not cross over to the opposite lane. It also provides guidance for vehicles to turn right if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Vehicles must come to a complete stop to ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing. Due to low visibility, attention should be given to other pedestrians who may be crossing from the same direction but are not yet visible. Vehicles should remain stopped until all pedestrians have crossed and the road ahead is clear. Under low lighting conditions, headlights should be used, if not already, to enhance visibility and alert pedestrians of the vehicle's presence. In cases where the traffic light status is unclear, the vehicle should proceed with caution, assuming that it may need to stop at a red or yellow light. Drivers must also be mindful of the conditions of low visibility at night and adjust their speed accordingly. The use of headlights and extra attention to potentially harder-to-see road users are crucial for safety.",
