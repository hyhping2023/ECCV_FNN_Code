        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario observed, various road users and objects come into play that could impact the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nStarting with vehicles, a red van is observed to be parked on the right side, with its positioning slightly obstructing the rightmost lane, posing a potential risk of becoming an obstacle. Caution is advised as other vehicles might need to swerve to avoid it. Further ahead, a bus is traveling in the same lane as the self-driving car, which could warrant a reduction in speed or lane change as the bus might halt to pick up or drop off passengers. Another white van can also be seen parked on the right side, but it is not currently a hindrance to traffic flow, though vigilance is required in case it becomes active or pedestrians come into proximity of the vehicle. Additionally, there is traffic in the opposite lane, which the autonomous vehicle should monitor for unexpected actions such as crossings or turns.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist riding in the same direction as the car, to the right of the road in a designated bicycle lane. Extra attention is needed as the cyclist may need to make sudden movements in response to road conditions or obstacles.\n\nNo traffic signs or traffic lights are reported in this scene, and no traffic cones are present that would direct traffic or signal roadwork.\n\nHowever, barriers are present in the form of a metal fence installed on the right side of the road, enclosing a pedestrian space. Passersby can be seen behind the fence, which might indicate nearby construction or roadwork, presenting the potential for pedestrians to enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAdditional elements include trees and streetlights that line both sides of the road. While these don't directly affect driving behavior, they necessitate monitoring for any unanticipated pedestrian movement that may occur in these areas.\n\nOverall, the autonomous vehicle must navigate this environment with caution, considering both stationary and movable obstacles, and be prepared for interactions with the various road users present."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the van on the right and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes due to the obstruction caused by parked vehicles. Approach the bus ahead with caution, as it may stop suddenly. Meanwhile, it is crucial to be aware of the cyclist on the right and be ready to respond when they enter the traffic lane. Be cautious when approaching the parked white van; slow down if necessary, and pay attention to the opening of doors or pedestrian movements. Finally, because of the indicated roadside work, the vehicle should remain alert to potential obstacles or pedestrians, and keep a safe passing distance from obstacles and trash bins on the right. Continue to monitor road conditions and the surrounding environment, and comply with traffic rules.",

It is designed to carry multiple passengers and is characterized by its large size and extended length compared to regular passenger vehicles. The presence of this vehicle indicates that the ego car may have to exercise caution while driving, maintaining a safe following distance. If the bus stops to pick up or drop off passengers, the ego car may have to stop or slow down and wait or possibly change lanes to pass the bus safely if the lane width and traffic conditions allow.",
