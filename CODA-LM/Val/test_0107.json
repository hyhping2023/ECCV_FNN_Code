Several cars are parked on the right side of the road, with colors ranging from white to dark. These parked vehicles indicate a narrower driving lane, necessitating careful driving and reducing speed to avoid potential hazards such as car doors opening or pedestrians appearing suddenly.\n2. Up ahead, in the same direction, there are several cars on the road. These vehicles will influence the traffic flow, and lane changes may be required depending on their speed and position.\n3. A white car is in the left lane facing the vehicle, indicating oncoming traffic. This oncoming traffic requires keeping in the correct lane and maintaining a safe distance from the center lane markings.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A motorcyclist wearing a dark jacket and helmet is riding parallel to the vehicle in the furthest right lane. The presence of the motorcyclist demands heightened alertness and readiness to respond to sudden lane changes or stops.\n2. An adult riding a bicycle with a child passenger is traveling to the left of the self-driven car. Cyclists' presence necessitates slowing down, stopping, yielding, and ensuring their safety.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\nRoad markings indicate pedestrian crosswalks. These markers alert the vehicle to potential pedestrian crossings and require preparedness to stop if necessary.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\nA traffic light ahead is displaying a red light. A red light indicates the vehicle should stop and wait at the upcoming intersection.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, forming a barrier between the sidewalk and the street. These cones signify either road construction or a restricted area, signaling that the vehicle should avoid entering the protected area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from bicycles and vehicles ahead, monitoring their speed and position. Be prepared to adjust your speed if traffic lights change or bicycle behavior necessitates it. Stay alert for potential obstacles or movements that could occur from parked vehicles, ensuring sufficient space is kept from traffic cones. Continue to watch for any additional signs or changes in road conditions. The vehicle should also maintain a moderate speed, be vigilant for pedestrians who might suddenly emerge from between parked cars, and be ready to respond to pedestrians at upcoming crosswalks. Moreover, monitor motorcyclists for sudden movements, keep a safe following distance from oncoming traffic, and avoid traffic cones by staying in the correct driving lane. Exercise caution when approaching intersections, and observe traffic lights to adapt to their signals. Considering current road users and conditions, the vehicle should slow down when approaching crosswalks, yield to bicycles, and be prepared to stop if necessary. Stay alert for pedestrians and watch for new obstacles that may arise from parked vehicles. It is advisable to maintain a safe following distance behind the white vehicle ahead.",
