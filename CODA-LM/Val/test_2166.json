Similarly, there are no pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists present in the image that would require the ego car to take their safety into consideration.\n\nHowever, there are several road signs and indicators that the ego car must heed. Directional signs are evident, indicating a right curve ahead with an advised speed limit of 20 km/h. Additionally, there is a No Parking sign on the left side, denoting that stopping or parking on that part of the road is not allowed. Traffic lights are not visible in this image, so they do not affect the driving path of the autonomous vehicle at this juncture.\n\nOn the roadway itself, there are traffic cones positioned on the right side, suggesting a roadside work area or a possible hazard that might partially obstruct the lane or require caution when driving by. Concrete barriers can be seen along the left side of the road, dividing the traffic flow and ensuring that vehicles stay within their respective lanes.\n\nFurthermore, on the right side of the road and near the curve, there is an accumulation of sand or debris which has its own implications for driving. The presence of such materials on the road can lower traction for the vehicle, presenting a slipping hazard, and therefore caution is advised, particularly when navigating the turn.\n\nAll considered, while the absence of other active road users simplifies some aspects of driving behavior for the autonomous car, attention must still be paid to road conditions and static signs that guide speed, positioning, and the overall navigation of the upcoming curve."

Stay within the lane, and be prepared for potential hazards that may not be immediately visible. The ego car should also be wary of the sand and debris on the right, maintaining a safe distance from the edge of the road and being prepared to adjust the trajectory smoothly if traction is compromised."
