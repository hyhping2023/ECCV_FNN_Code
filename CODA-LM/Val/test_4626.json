Firstly, there is a white SUV directly in front of the ego car with its brake lights on, indicating that it is either stopping or slowing down. The ego car must therefore maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop to avoid a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large red and white truck positioned in the adjacent lane to the right, slightly ahead of the ego car. The ego car should monitor this truck's movement carefully as it could potentially change lanes or affect the flow of traffic.\n\nFurthermore, there is a yellow warning sign on the left side of the road. Although the details are not fully clear, it seems to indicate that there might be road work ahead or that the lane is closed ahead. The ego car should be cautious of potential changes in traffic patterns or obstructions on the road due to construction or lane closures.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is an object often used to control road traffic. It features a conical shape, typically orange in color with a white reflective band around it to enhance visibility at night or in poor light conditions. The purpose of this item is to alert drivers to potential hazards or road work, and it often indicates that drivers should proceed with caution or move away from the lane in which it's placed. In this scenario, the ego car will need to maintain its existing course to avoid the traffic cone, remaining mindful of the possibility of narrowed lanes or nearby roadwork.",

Additionally, the ego car should be ready for potential road work or lane closures ahead as indicated by the warning sign on the left. No drastic changes to driving behavior are recommended given the visible road conditions and the absence of direct obstructions or vulnerable road users in the immediate vicinity."
