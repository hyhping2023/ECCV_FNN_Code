On the left side of the vehicle, a white van is driving in the same direction. This van may suddenly decelerate, stop, or veer off the lane and head towards the main vehicle.\n2. Additionally, various vehicles, including a small white car and a blue sedan, are driving on the left side of the road. These vehicles may change lanes or slow down; hence, the ego car must be prepared and maintain a distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users:\n1. On the right side of the road, there might be two animals that look like dogs. These animals could potentially run into the driving lane, posing a danger and requiring the vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop to avoid a collision.\n\nOther objects on the road include:\n1. On the right side of a cyclist, there are some industrial machines. Although these machines do not pose a direct threat to the road or the vehicle's path, vigilance is necessary for any debris or accidental movement they may cause.\n2. The road surface is uneven and may contain debris, which could affect the vehicle's traction and control. The vehicle should slow down and be more alert to maintain control and avoid damage.\n3. An unspecified object is observed on the right side of the road, which could be debris or a roadside facility. It does not currently obstruct the lane but should be monitored as it might move onto the road or affect the available width of the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the potential for vans ahead to stop, vehicles parked along the road narrowing the driving lane, and animals that might appear on the road, the vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to brake for sudden movements or obstacles at any time. Be cautious when overtaking bicycles, leaving as much space as possible to ensure their safety and comply with overtaking regulations. Continue to adhere to standard road safety practices, including maintaining an appropriate speed and staying alert to changes in the surrounding environment.",
