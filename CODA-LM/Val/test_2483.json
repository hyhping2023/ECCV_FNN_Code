Further metal barriers are visible in the left foreground, hinting at a likely construction or work zone ahead.\n\nThere's also a pile of snow or other material on the right side which could obscure hazards or pedestrians, narrowing the road and reducing visibility for quick reactions to unforeseen obstacles."
