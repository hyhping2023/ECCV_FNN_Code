        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scene, there are several elements that are noteworthy:\n\nVehicles: \nA large yellow construction vehicle (excavator) is parked on the road ahead on the right side, with its arm extended towards a building. Its presence and activities may cause obstacles or unexpected movements, which means that the autonomous vehicle should proceed with caution.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\nTwo individual vulnerable road users are observed:\n1. A motorcyclist, accompanied by a passenger, both wearing dark clothing and helmets, is riding on the left side of the vehicle. Given their proximity and potential for lateral movement, it is necessary for the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe distance to ensure safety.\n2. A cyclist, also dressed in dark clothing, is traveling ahead in the same direction as the car, but on its right-hand side. The cyclist's potentially unpredictable actions and increased vulnerability compared to motorized vehicles dictate that the autonomous vehicle keep a safe following distance.\n\nTraffic Cones:\nOrange traffic cones have been placed directly in front of the vehicle, suggesting the demarcation of a work area or the presence of road obstructions. The vehicle is signaled to reduce speed and potentially change lanes to maneuver around these ahead obstructions.\n\nBarriers:\nTemporary fencing or barriers equipped with red and white warning tape are set up, cordoning off an area on the vehicle's right side. These barriers are indications of a hazard or construction zone where entry is prohibited. They serve as a reminder for the vehicle to keep a safe distance from the area and to stay vigilant for potential obstacles or pedestrians that might enter its driving path.\n\nOther Objects:\nThe construction area is surrounded by red and white warning tape, highlighting the presence of potential dangers. This restricted area could impact road access and traffic flow, signaling the need for increased caution when navigating around it.\n\nAll these elements collectively contribute to the complexity of the driving environment, necessitating an autonomous vehicle to be alert, cautious, and ready to adapt to the changing dynamics of the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current situation, the vehicle should slow down and be prepared to possibly change lanes in order to avoid construction vehicles and motorcycles, ensuring safety. Furthermore, the vehicle should also be ready to react to sudden movements from construction vehicles at any time and remain vigilant of other road users or obstacles that may appear within this active work zone. Drive cautiously, significantly reduce speed, and be prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary. Since motorcyclists are traveling ahead, the vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from them. Continuously monitor traffic cones and obstacles to understand in advance if a lane change is needed. The wet and slippery road conditions also demand a reduction in speed to ensure sufficient stopping distance under the given environmental conditions.",

In this context, the presence of a tricycle indicates that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected movements or stops by the tricycle.
