        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several notable elements which affect driving behavior:\n\nVehicles:\n- An emergency vehicle is situated on the side of the road, characterized by bright lighting and reflective markings. This signals an ongoing road incident that demands attention and may involve individuals working close to the traffic lanes, thus necessitating cautious driving.\n- A large vehicle, likely a truck or specialized machinery, is parked on the right side, partially blocking the lane with its rear end facing the ego vehicle. This suggests potential roadwork or an obstruction, calling for reduced speed or a lane change.\n- Another construction vehicle is visible on the right, with bright headlights and reflective markings, indicating active construction. This implies that maintenance activity might partially obstruct the lane, requiring careful maneuvering by the ego vehicle.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- There are workers clad in high-visibility vests on the right side of the road, next to the parked machinery. Their proximity to the roadway increases safety risks, and the ego vehicle must therefore slow down and provide adequate space.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- A series of reflective traffic cones are placed from the road's center to the right lane, pointing towards changes in traffic flow and a possible reduction in drivable space. The cones are directing traffic away from the working area, which means the ego vehicle needs to adjust its trajectory to steer clear of the work zone.\n\nBarriers:\n- A physical barrier located on the right helps divide the road from the worksite, acting as a protective measure both for the workers and the worksite. It emphasizes the separation of the work zone from the drivable road.\n- To the road's left, there is a barrier wall marked with high visibility reflective white and black patterns. It outlines the road's edge, suggesting the absence of a shoulder and highlighting the importance of maintaining lane discipline.\n\nOther Objects:\n- Glare from vehicle lights and reflective surfaces is present, which may impair visibility and reduce the driver's reaction time, necessitating additional caution."
