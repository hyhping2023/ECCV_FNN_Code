Hence, the following vehicle should ensure a safe following distance and be ready to adapt to the white car's movements.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side of the road, there's a yellow triangular warning sign. This sign signifies that traffic will be merging from the right or an additional road is joining from that direction.
