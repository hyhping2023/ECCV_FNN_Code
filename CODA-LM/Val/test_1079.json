Additionally, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones to report. However, there is a metal barrier obstructing the road, which is accompanied by a red and white sign on the left side, placed in the center of the frame. This barrier likely indicates that there is a road closure or construction ahead, signaling that the vehicle cannot proceed forward and must find an alternate route. Furthermore, the surroundings are dimly lit with trees and a dark sky, suggesting nighttime conditions. These poor lighting conditions can reduce visibility, requiring the ego car to proceed with increased caution."

It is a portable fence consisting of metal bars or tubing, often interconnected, used to block access to a specific area. The reflective sign on the barrier indicates that it is meant to be visible at night or in low-light conditions. For the ego car, this object signifies that the current pathway is not passable, suggesting the need for the driver to stop and find an alternate route, or wait until the barrier is removed if it's a temporary blockage.",
