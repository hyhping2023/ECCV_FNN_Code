This vehicle is either stationary or moving slowly, affecting the available road space and requiring careful navigation by the ego vehicle due to it being a potential moving obstacle and causing possible delays.\n\nA pedestrian is seen on the left sidewalk at a distance. Though not an immediate risk, this pedestrian should be monitored in case they enter the roadway.\n\nAfter the construction vehicle on the right side, a series of road works indication signs signal potential road work activities ahead. These signs suggest changes in normal traffic patterns and the presence of additional obstacles.\n\nConcrete barriers with metal railings on top are on the left, separating the construction site from the road, along with temporary fencing on the right edge. These barriers limit the road width and necessitate cautious maneuvers to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAlong the right side of the road, there is construction debris and a large pile of materials covered in green netting, indicating active construction work. This debris poses a risk of road obstruction or tire damage, and the netting suggests ongoing work that may result in further obstructions or workers entering the roadway."

The driver should also be alert for any construction workers or unexpected obstacles. Passing the construction vehicle might require waiting for it to move or ensuring there is adequate space in the opposing lane of traffic. Maintaining a safe distance from the barriers is crucial. Attention to road conditions is also critical due to the muddy and uneven surface. Monitor the pedestrian and be ready to stop if they enter the roadway. Navigate carefully to maintain a safe buffer from the right side construction vehicle and left side barriers."
