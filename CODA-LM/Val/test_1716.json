The pedestrian's proximity to the driving area may require the ego car to adjust its speed and trajectory to ensure safety. Despite the pedestrian not being on the main road and moving away, the icy conditions present a risk of unpredictable movements, so caution is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple traffic cones arranged in a line on the right side of the road, signaling potential road works or hazards ahead. These cones indicate that the ego car may need to change its lane position as part of the road could be closed off or dangerous.\n\nBarricades with reflective markers are also visible on the right, marking an area that seems to be off-limits for vehicles, likely due to road construction or maintenance. These barriers will require the ego car to possibly reduce speed and increase alertness as they may narrow the available lanes and indicate a construction zone or a temporary rerouting.\n\nLastly, there are piles of snow and ice on the edges of the drivable area, which could pose a risk if they encroach onto the road. The presence of these elements could reduce the margin for error and might necessitate evasive maneuvers if they obstruct part of the road."

Lane adjustments should be made early to avoid the area demarcated by traffic cones and barriers. The ego car should prepare for potential hazards that may not be immediately visible due to road conditions and obstructions at the side of the road. Given the presence of a road user potentially crossing and the hazardous road conditions, the ego vehicle should significantly reduce its speed and prepare to stop if necessary to give way. The driver should be vigilant, observing the road user's actions closely to anticipate any sudden changes. Furthermore, the vehicle should steer clear of the cones and barriers, staying within the available open lanes. It is also advised to apply smooth and controlled inputs to steering, throttle, and braking due to the slick road conditions to maintain safety."
