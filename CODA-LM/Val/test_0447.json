Its size and position require the ego car to either slow down or change lanes since it obstructs the free passage or maintenance of current speed.\n  - Several cars in adjacent lanes, including a black sedan to the left, with varying gaps between them. The presence and movement of these cars may affect the ego car's lane-changing possibilities.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - A green traffic light is visible ahead, slightly to the left, indicating that the traffic in the ego car's direction is permitted to move. The green light means the ego car should continue moving forward but remain alert as the light could change.\n\n- **Barriers**: \n  - A concrete median barrier separates the lanes of opposing traffic flow. This barrier restricts the ego car's ability to make any left turns or crossing maneuvers."

Given its significant size and the nature of its load, this vehicle may move slower than standard traffic and may require extra room for maneuvering. Thus, the driver of the ego car should keep a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement, especially if this construction vehicle is approaching a worksite where it may be turning or offloading its contents.",

Monitor the green traffic light for changes and be prepared to stop if it shifts to yellow. Continue to observe road conditions for any changes or unexpected hazards. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance behind the concrete mixing truck, being prepared for potential stops or slowdowns that might not be visible due to the truck's size. Overtaking should be done with caution, only if the adjacent lane is clear and it's safe to do so. Since the state of the traffic light is obscured, the ego car should rely on the behavior of the truck in front to anticipate the traffic light's state. The median barrier should be observed for any signs indicating possible areas where turning or crossing might be allowed. Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck in front, be aware of its potential stops or turns. Monitor the adjacent lanes for cars that may enter the lane of the ego car, especially as some cars are in motion and may require the ego car to adjust speed or position. No immediate lane changes are suggested due to the green traffic light and the physical median barrier, but be prepared for changes in the environment. Continue driving forward as the traffic light is green, while obeying all traffic rules and speeds."
