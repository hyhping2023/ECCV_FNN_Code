The person's presence suggests potential movement around the van, which could pose a risk if they step onto the road. The presence of a pedestrian close to the road edge increases the risk of an unexpected entry into the roadway, requiring cautious driving from the ego vehicle."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a white van parked on the left side of the road, partly occupying the sidewalk and with its rear oriented towards the ego vehicle, which may impede road width and visibility for the ego vehicle, especially concerning any road users that could emerge from behind the van. A black car is also parked on the right side of the street, poised as a potential hazard should it unexpectedly pull out of its parking spot, and it could conceal pedestrians or other road users from view.\n\nOn the pedestrian front, there is an individual standing on the left sidewalk near the parked white van. The pedestrianâ€™s proximity to the edge of the road and the van suggests a heightened possibility of inadvertently stepping onto the road, which necessitates increased attentiveness and preparedness to stop or slow down from the ego vehicle.\n\nThe absence of clear traffic signs and traffic lights in the image suggests that standard road rules should be maintained without the need for alterations based on traffic control devices.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic cones present, there is a presence of yellow and black caution barriers on the right, hinting at possible road or sidewalk closures that might push pedestrians onto the road, as well as indicating an area for vehicles to avoid.\n\nLastly, on the left side of the road, close to the pedestrian and the parked van, there are buckets. While these are not currently obstructing the roadway, they could pose a risk if they were to be displaced onto the driving path. The presence of these buckets should be monitored as potential hazards for the moving ego vehicle."

It should be ready to brake in case the pedestrian steps onto the road or the black car starts moving. Given the potentially wet or compromised road conditions, the ego vehicle should maintain a lower speed and be vigilant for any road work indicated by the barriers. If the lighting condition is as poor as represented in the image, using headlights and staying alert for reflective surfaces indicating puddles or ice is advised. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe speed that allows for quick reaction to any potential hazards. Be prepared to stop or maneuver safely should the pedestrian or any unseen hazard emerge onto the road. Since visibility may be limited by the parked vehicles, especially the white van, keep an appropriate distance and scan the environment ahead thoroughly. Be observant of the barriers to the right and stay in the appropriate lane to avoid the restricted area."
