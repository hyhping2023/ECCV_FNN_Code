        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there is a large construction vehicle with a concrete mixer directly ahead in the lane. It is located on the right side and is exhibiting warning lights, suggesting it may be moving slowly or is stopped. Given the vehicle's sizable dimensions, limited mobility, and risk of unexpected stops or maneuvers, it is crucial for our autonomous car to remain vigilant. The car must be ready to decelerate, keep an adequate following distance, or if it is feasible and safe, change lanes to avoid potential dangers.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are also traffic signs that announce maximum vehicle height and weight limits for passing under an upcoming bridge, set at 4.9 meters in height and 13 tons in weight. These signs are integral for guiding the ego vehicle's speed and are particularly pertinent for larger vehicles that might exceed these height and weight limits."

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle with a rotating cement mixer on the back is visible. Its bright rear lights are on, suggesting that it might be slowing down, stopped, or about to make a turn. The presence of this vehicle ahead will require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down according to the construction vehicle's actions. Additionally, the vehicle's size might obstruct views ahead, so the ego car should proceed with caution and be alert for any signals or directions from the construction crew or the vehicle's indicators.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of the construction vehicle ahead, the ego car should reduce speed to comply with the speed limit of 49 km/h, if not already doing so, and prepare for potential stops or slow-moving traffic. Observing the clearance and weight signs, the ego car should ensure it does not exceed the height and weight restrictions, which is typically not a concern for standard passenger cars. The ego vehicle should monitor the construction vehicle's signal lights for cues on its intentions and, if it's safe and necessary, consider changing lanes to pass the construction vehicle while respecting the speed limit and road conditions."
