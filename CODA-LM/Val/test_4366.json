Firstly, a blue car is parked on the right-hand side of the road, with its rear end sticking out into the driving lane. This parked vehicle requires the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to prevent a side collision due to the narrowed driving space. Additionally, there are multiple cars parked on both sides of the road ahead, which further reduces the available driving lane and necessitates careful maneuvering.\n\nA pedestrian is also present on the sidewalk to the right, facing away from the road. While they are not directly in the path of the ego car, their proximity to the roadway means the driver must remain alert in case the pedestrian unexpectedly steps into the road.\n\nTraffic cones are set up along the right side of the road, leading up to the parked blue car, indicating a work zone or a potential road obstruction. The ego car will need to navigate around these cones, which may involve changing lanes or adjusting speed.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects in the image that impact the ego car's driving behavior. Additionally, no traffic lights are visible, and therefore, they do not influence the ego car's actions at this time."

Proceed with caution and prepare to change lanes to the left if the lane is obstructed by the blue car, ensuring it is safe to merge. Keep an increased following distance from any vehicles ahead due to the reduced tire grip on the wet surface. Continuous monitoring of pedestrian movement is recommended to anticipate any potential road crossing and to give right of way if necessary."
