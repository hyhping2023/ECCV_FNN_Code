The main vehicle must be ready to stop or maneuver around the bus while staying alert, and be mindful of other vehicles or road users that may be hidden from view. Adjust the car's sun visor or wear sunglasses to reduce the glare of sunlight affecting the driver's vision. Be prepared to slow down or stop for any workers or unexpected obstacles. Maintain a safe distance from vehicles parked at the roadside, and if the right lane is obstructed by obstacles and traffic cones, be prepared to merge to the left.",

Awareness of the truck's blind spots is also critical as the driver of the ego car maneuvers around or near the truck.",
