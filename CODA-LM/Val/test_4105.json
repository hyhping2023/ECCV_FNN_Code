        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects present. However, there are notable road alterations indicated by traffic cones and barriers.\n\nA series of yellow traffic cones can be seen placed on the left side of the lane, closely accompanied by a blue construction barrier. These traffic cones indicate that there might be lane narrowing or a complete closure ahead. This arrangement signals a deviation from the regular traffic pattern, necessitating the ego car, which refers to the self-driving car from whose perspective the scene is described, to possibly adjust its position more to the right or prepare for a merge, ensuring smooth navigation around the construction zone.\n\nAdditionally, a blue construction barrier is positioned on the right side of the road, extending into the distance. This barrier is equipped with reflective materials and adorned with warning messages, hinting at ongoing road work or demarcating areas that are currently inaccessible to vehicles. The presence of this barrier could imply that the lanes may be narrowed, and there might be an impending need for vehicles to reduce their speed for safety reasons as they navigate through or near the construction site."

            "description and explanation": "A row of traffic cones, which typically consist of a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. They are used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed for utility work or emergency services. Due to their bright color, usually orange, with reflective strips, they are highly visible during both day and night, alerting drivers to changes in the driving path. The future driving behavior of the ego car will be influenced as the driver will need to slow down and stay within the limits of the lane that has been adjusted to accommodate the cones. The driver must not cross the cones and should be attentive to any additional signage or roadworkers that may be in the area.",
