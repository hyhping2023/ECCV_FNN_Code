The significant size of this object suggests it is meant for industrial use, possibly related to telecommunications or power infrastructure. Although it is not directly an influence on the driving behavior of the ego car in this scenario, if it were not secured properly and were to roll onto the road, it could become a significant hazard. As a driver, one should always be cautious of potential obstacles or hazards adjacent to the roadway.",

These items are located off the roadway, likely on a storage area or outside a facility that uses or manufactures cable or wire products. The ego car should be aware that the vicinity is possibly an industrial area and be cautious of heavy vehicles that may enter or exit such facilities. However, since the reels are stationary and placed off the roadway, they do not directly affect the immediate driving behavior of the ego car.",
