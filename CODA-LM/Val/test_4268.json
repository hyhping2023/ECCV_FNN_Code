        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable elements present.\n\nFirstly, on the left side of the view, there is a white SUV. This SUV is traveling in the opposite direction, located within the adjacent lane. While this vehicle occupies the opposite lane and does not directly influence the immediate driving behavior, it's crucial to remain vigilant for any unforeseen maneuvers it might undertake.\n\nSecondly, an additional feature visible on the right lane ahead is a small object. This object could potentially serve as a driving impediment. In cases where it is not feasible to safely drive over this object, vehicles may need to navigate around it, thus requiring a detour to avoid any complications.\n\nThese elements together highlight the importance of continuous awareness of one's surroundings to ensure safe and effective driving decisions in the presence of various road users and potential obstacles."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the SUV on the left in case it suddenly changes lanes or adjusts its speed. Be prepared for unexpected movements from the white SUV. Additionally, our vehicle should cautiously change lanes or adjust its position within the lane to avoid small obstacles on the road, while considering surrounding traffic and ensuring that all maneuvers are safely conducted. Our vehicle should drive carefully when approaching potential dangers and reduce speed. The driver should also look for and follow any information provided on the nearby overhead signs. Adjust the speed and driving style based on the inconsistency described in the road conditions, and be prepared to take corrective actions for the unpredictable behavior of the SUV and any necessary adjustments due to unidentified road objects.",
