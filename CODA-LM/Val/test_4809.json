        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several significant elements to note. Firstly, there is a black vehicle in the rightmost lane ahead, maintaining its lane position. The ego car must carefully monitor this vehicle for any changes in speed or unexpected lane changes. Also, there are several vehicles in the adjacent lanes to the left at varying distances. The closest of these is directly parallel to the ego vehicle. It is crucial for the ego car to keep a safe distance from these vehicles and be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes in response to their movements.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, a directional arrow sign is visible on the right side of the road, pointing to the right. This indicates a curve or exit that is coming up, reminding the ego car to be prepared to follow the direction of the road.\n\nFurthermore, there is a continuous concrete barrier on the right-hand side of the road. This barrier serves to separate the lanes of traffic from the opposite side of the highway, reducing the risk of vehicles crossing into oncoming traffic and aiding the ego car in staying within its travel path.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would further influence the ego car's driving behavior."

Depending on whether the tire is a road hazard or placed there for another reason, the ego car may need to maintain lane position and possibly alert other drivers to the obstacle if it is determined to be a hazard. The future driving behavior should include heightened awareness and readiness to avoid debris or obstacles on the road surface.",

Continuously scan the environment for any unexpected obstacles or changes."
