    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of parked vehicles and pedestrians on the right side of the road, combined with poor lighting conditions, the vehicle should reduce speed and be prepared to adjust its driving path to the right as necessary when passing these road users. Headlights should be turned on (if they have not already been) to improve visibility, and the vehicle should be ready to stop at any time in case a pedestrian unexpectedly enters its path. Furthermore, the vehicle should also be prepared to react to any sudden movements by people beside the parked vehicles, monitoring for other road users or obstacles that may be difficult to see due to the low light conditions. If the vehicle's sensors can filter glare, they should be adjusted to enhance visibility and detection of any road users or signs that are currently invisible.",
