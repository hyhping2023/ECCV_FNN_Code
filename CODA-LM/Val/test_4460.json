Alongside, there are long red and white traffic barriers parallel to the ego vehicle on the left, potentially indicating road work or lane closures. These barriers serve as a guide to keep the ego car within the correct driving path and to alert the driver to potential construction zones or road hazards.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."

The car should remain vigilant for any construction-related signage, changes in traffic patterns, or vehicles unexpectedly entering the road. If the road appears constricted or partially closed ahead due to the barriers, the ego car should be prepared to change lanes safely if required. Additionally, watch for the parked white sedan on the roadside for any movement or doors opening that could affect the traffic flow. The vehicle should follow any posted traffic rules that pertain to construction zones and be prepared to yield to construction vehicles that might enter the roadway."
