Its presence and speed will influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes and speed adjustments.\n   - A white car is further ahead in the right lane, also traveling in the same direction.

Their positions and movements may affect the ego car's driving strategy, particularly if the ego car is considering a lane change or adjusting speed.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs:**\n   - There are orange construction signs to the right side of the road, indicating a work zone ahead. These signs alert to possible changes in traffic patterns due to road work and may necessitate reduced speed and heightened awareness.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones:**\n   - Traffic cones are arranged in a taper formation on the right side of the right lane, beginning to merge traffic into the left lane.
