This sedan appears to be exiting a parking lot and might enter our lane, potentially causing a conflict.\n  - Ahead, there are several vehicles, some stationary and some in motion, occupying two lanes at different distances from our car. The behavior of this traffic will directly affect the speed and lane choices of the autonomous vehicle.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users:** \n  - A pedestrian is on the sidewalk to the left of our car. Although currently not on the road, their proximity suggests they might enter the road and interact with traffic.\n\n- **Traffic Signs:** \n  - An elevated road has a directional arrow indicating straight ahead, suggesting that the vehicle can continue moving forward but should stay alert to signal changes and remain vigilant.\n\n- **Traffic Lights:** \n  - The traffic light ahead, visible in a straight line, is showing red, indicating that the vehicle should prepare to stop at the intersection.\n\n- **Traffic Cones:** \n  - Red and white traffic cones on the right side of the road indicate potential danger or ongoing road construction. Drivers should keep to the left and remain alert for road workers or changes in road conditions.\n\n- **Barriers:** \n  - A green hedge extends parallel to the right side of the road, separating the sidewalk from a row of trees. These barriers are permanent and do not immediately affect driving behavior beyond delineating road boundaries.\n\n- **Other Objects:** \n  - Several objects on the right side of the road, close to the conical signs, appear to be road construction equipment. This presence reinforces the need for caution and potentially slowing down to avoid workers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the possibility of a white sedan entering the road, please proceed with caution. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. Be prepared to respond at any moment should pedestrians step onto the road. Stay alert for changes in traffic lights, and comply with lane changes or restrictions indicated by cones due to construction. Slow down as necessary to safely navigate any construction areas or irregular conditions on the right side of the road. Pay attention to the movements of pedestrians on the sidewalk, and remain vigilant for any potential changes in road signs or emerging obstacles.
