The rear side of the truck is in view, showing advertisement graphics. This parked position of the truck might necessitate a change of lane or speed reduction for the ego vehicle to maintain safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, on the side of the road, there are large industrial reels and a blue drum near a fence. These items, while not on the roadway, are sizable and proximate, signaling a potential industrial zone presence. This could indicate the possibility of unexpected road encroachments or vehicles that the autonomous driving system should be ready to react to.\n\nThere were no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers detected in the image."
