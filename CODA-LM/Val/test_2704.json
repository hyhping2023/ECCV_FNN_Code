        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, we first observe a white cement mixer truck to the right of our vehicle, straddling our lane and the one adjacent. The bulky nature of the cement mixer, along with its encroachment on multiple lanes, may obscure our view, thus necessitating increased following distance or a lane change to ensure safety. Additionally, there's a small truck ahead, heading in the opposite direction, that appears to be following traffic rules and doesn't present an immediate concern, yet requires us to keep a safe distance.\n\nFurther down the road, a white car travels in the right lane on the opposing side. Although it's at a considerable distance presently and doesn't demand urgent attention, we must stay alert for any potential left turns or lane changes the car may execute.\n\nOn our side of the road, we see a bicycle rider progressing in the same direction of traffic. Since cyclists can make sudden movements, it is essential to slow down while passing and to give them ample room.\n\nWhen it comes to traffic signals, there's a green light permitting travel straight ahead, but the red light for left turns mandates a complete stop and adherence to the signals until it's legally safe and clear to proceed with the turn.\n\nLastly, the roadside is bordered by a metal fence on the left, defining the perimeter between the road and pedestrian areas. This barrier limits the space for possible lateral movements, which is particularly significant in scenarios where evasive maneuvers are required to avoid intimate road users like cyclists."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given that the left-turn traffic light is red, the self-driving vehicle should prepare to stop unless it plans to legally proceed straight. Moreover, the self-driving vehicle should monitor the position and speed of the concrete mixer truck to ensure a safe braking distance, and it may need to change lanes after passing the intersection to overtake slow-moving vehicles such as utility vehicles and bicyclists, provided it is safe and legal to do so. Due to the red traffic light, the self-driving vehicle should stop. During this process, it should maintain an appropriate following distance from the motorcycle rider ahead and monitor the actions of the oncoming concrete mixer truck in case of any sudden changes. The self-driving vehicle should prepare for a smooth stop, paying attention to the stopping distance to ensure the safety of the motorcycle rider ahead. As there is a slower tricycle directly ahead, the self-driving vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop because of the red traffic signal. The self-driving vehicle should drive cautiously, staying alert to other vehicles and cyclists. Only if it is safe and in compliance with traffic regulations should overtaking the tricycle be considered, taking into account the red signal and oncoming traffic.",
