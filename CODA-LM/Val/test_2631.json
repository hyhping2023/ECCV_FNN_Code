This requires the autonomous vehicle to adjust its following distance and speed accordingly. Additionally, a yield sign is visible on the right, indicating that the vehicle should be ready to slow down or stop to let other vehicles merge or cross ahead. Overhead, there are traffic signs that could indicate lane directions for turning or continuing straight, which will influence the lane choice for the vehicle.\n\nOn the road, there is a pattern of reflective traffic cones on the right side, directing traffic to move left, signaling a change in the normal traffic pattern and the need for the vehicle to merge or change lanes. A red and white striped barrier is present along the right edge of the road, marking the limit of the drivable area and warning vehicles not to cross into it.\n\nLastly, there is reflected light and illumination from various sources such as signs, infrastructure, and roadside facilities. While these do not directly impact the driving route, they may cause visual disturbances or glare, requiring the vehicle to navigate with extra caution."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the brake lights being illuminated on the vehicle ahead, which is at a close distance, and the presence of traffic cones on the roadside indicating a merge or shift in lanes, our vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to follow the new traffic pattern. Due to the wet road conditions, we should also increase the safety distance from the car in front and be ready to adapt to changes in road layout as indicated by the signage. Drive cautiously, pay attention to the brake lights of the vehicle ahead, and follow the road markings as directed by the traffic cones. Because of the rainy weather and road conditions, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and be ready to yield as instructed by traffic signs. Overall, keep a moderate speed, stay alert for any signs indicating construction zones or lane merges, and adjust lane position when necessary.",
