These parked vehicles have narrowed the drivable area. Potential hazards include car doors opening or pedestrians suddenly emerging from between the vehicles.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**: A blue parking sign is visible on the right side, indicating a designated parking area. This sign suggests vehicular movements in the nearby space, highlighting the need for vigilance.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: On the right side of the sidewalk, there is a trash can, an umbrella, and various stalls and shops. These objects are off the road and should not directly impact driving unless pedestrians from these areas enter the road."

            "description and explanation": "A motorized two-wheeled vehicle known as a moped is pictured. This vehicle commonly features an engine with a smaller displacement and less power than a motorcycle, making it suitable for short-distance travel and often used for local commuting. In this scenario, the presence of the moped indicates that the ego car should be cautious and maintain a safe distance, as mopeds can decelerate or change direction suddenly. Awareness of such vehicles can assist in preventing collisions and ensuring a smooth flow of traffic.",

Dogs may unpredictably enter the roadway or move towards vehicles, which necessitates that drivers exercise caution when they observe a dog near or on the road. The ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to stop or avoid the dog if it enters the car's path. This underscores the importance of vigilance and readiness to react when animals are in close proximity to the roadway to ensure the safety of all.",

It is also important to consider that mopeds can accelerate and decelerate differently from cars, so the ego car driver must be vigilant and give the moped ample space on the road.",
