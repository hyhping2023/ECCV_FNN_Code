A traffic cone is positioned in front of it. The presence of the RV reduces the usable width of the road and may obstruct the view of potential hazards that could emerge from the side of the parked vehicle. Additionally, a single orange traffic cone is placed near the parked RV on the road, signaling a temporary change in the road layout. This cone serves as a warning for drivers to proceed with caution and highlights the presence of the RV as a potential hazard or obstruction. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

The absence of traffic signs and traffic lights suggests no upcoming road changes, but the driver should still be vigilant and ready to react to any unforeseen events. It's also important to check for oncoming traffic due to the two-way nature of the road."
