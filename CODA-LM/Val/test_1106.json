A cement mixer truck directly in front of the ego vehicle, characterized by its white color, visible rotating drum, and extended chute. This truck significantly affects the driving behavior due to its large size, which can obscure road conditions ahead or make sudden movements such as stopping or turning.\n2. A red flatbed truck is present on the left, moving in the same direction as the ego car. This vehicle presents a potential hazard due to its size, the possibility of lane changes or unexpected slowing, and the likelihood of creating blind spots.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there are two observed:\n1. A green traffic light ahead allows vehicles to proceed, indicating that it is legal for the ego vehicle to continue moving forward unless other conditions dictate otherwise.\n2. A red traffic light is visible in the distance at an intersection ahead, signaling that the ego car and other road users must stop at the intersection, thus the ego car must prepare to reduce speed accordingly. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Buses are generally designed with a long chassis and multiple windows along the sides, with an entry door near the front. In the context of driving behavior, the ego car should maintain a safe distance when following a bus to ensure adequate stopping distance and visibility. The size of the bus may also obscure some traffic elements ahead, requiring additional caution.",

This type of vehicle is typically large and heavy, which affects its acceleration, braking, and maneuverability. The ego car should maintain increased following distance, anticipating the potential for slow stops and turns. Drivers should be prepared for the possibility of this vehicle making wide turns or stopping to unload, which could affect traffic flow.",

Additionally, the driver of the ego car should be aware of the flatbed truck on the left and avoid rapid lane changes which could result in a collision. Monitoring the speed and trajectory of the mixer truck is essential to anticipate any potential maneuvers or stops. Actively observe the traffic lights and be prepared for them to change, adjusting speed accordingly to maintain traffic flow and safety. Continuously assess the environment for any new road users or changes in the traffic situation."
