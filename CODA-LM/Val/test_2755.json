This vehicle is a large, slow-moving load that could reduce visibility, require more stopping distance, and influence the ego car's ability to maintain speed or change lanes due to its heavy load.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, a green and white bus is positioned in an adjacent lane, parallel to the ego vehicle, with its side visible to the driver. The proximity and size of the bus may limit visibility and maneuverability, necessitating caution in case it halts suddenly or passengers embark or disembark. The bus might make sudden stops to pick up passengers, which could affect the flow of traffic and may require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there are various passenger vehicles present in adjacent lanes. These include a white sedan to the left and a blue compact car to the right of the ego car. These vehicles could potentially change lanes or adjust their speed unexpectedly, necessitating awareness and possible adjustments from the ego car. The heavy traffic conditions could cause frequent stops and starts, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for sudden changes.\n\nMoreover, a white sedan is visible in the left side mirror of the ego car, located in the lane to the left and slightly behind the ego vehicle.

This type of vehicle is often slower than regular traffic and may have restrictions on the roads it can travel on.

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared for potential stops or slowdowns, and observe the movement of the bus in the adjacent lane. If the bus signals an intention to stop, be ready to adjust speed accordingly. When considering a lane change, the driver should be cautious of the white sedan spotted in the side mirror and ensure it is safe to merge. Additionally, the driver should remain attentive to possible road work or obstructions that the construction vehicle might imply. Lane changes should be executed with caution due to the proximity and behavior of surrounding traffic. It's also advisable for the ego car to prepare for potential adjustments in speed or path due to the large vehicle ahead, which may cause visibility issues or unexpected maneuvers. Remain vigilant for any road signs or changes in traffic light status that might currently be obstructed from view. Given the heavy vehicle in front and the high-density traffic scenario, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared for lower speeds, and avoid unnecessary lane changing. If the bus on the right initiates a lane change, the ego car must also be ready to adjust speed or position to accommodate. Overall, the ego car should proceed with heightened caution, given the reduced maneuverability in this environment."
