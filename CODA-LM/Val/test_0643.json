Given the nighttime conditions, reduce speed to accommodate for reduced visibility and potential road surface hazards. Keep headlights and taillights on for visibility to others and monitor the road for any unexpected obstacles or changes in the traffic flow. Use low-beam headlights to avoid blinding oncoming drivers while remaining vigilant for any road users that are more difficult to see at night."
