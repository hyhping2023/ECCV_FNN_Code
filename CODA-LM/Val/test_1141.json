The visibility of the vehicle's warning lights also indicates that the vehicle is operating in a work capacity, which requires increased caution by surrounding traffic."

It occupies the same lane and has rotating beacon lights, signaling it may move slowly or make frequent stops for work. This necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe distance and prepares for potential stops. Additionally, multiple passenger cars are seen in the adjacent lanes to the left, moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to remain cautious of these vehicles potentially changing lanes, which could interfere with the ego carâ€™s ability to maneuver safely.\n\nThe traffic signs category spotlights directional signs positioned on the right side above the road, indicating a junction ahead. These signs serve as a cue for the ego car to be ready for lane changes or deceleration from other road users approaching the junction.\n\nA green traffic light is noted through the windshield across the intersection, authorizing the ego car and others to proceed but with continued vigilance on the traffic flow and potential changes in the signal.\n\nAdditionally, a median barrier adorned with plants separates the opposing lanes of traffic. This barrier restricts movement across lanes and directs the traffic flow, limiting the maneuvering options for the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects noted in this particular image."

Monitor the movement of vehicles in the adjacent lanes, particularly those that may enter the ego car's lane, increasing the following distance if required. Proceed through the intersection with caution due to the green traffic light but remain alert to the traffic signals and the actions of other drivers at the intersection. As there is a junction ahead indicated by the directional signs, the ego car should be prepared for potential lane changes from other vehicles and be ready to navigate the junction according to the intended route. Follow the traffic flow and respect the lane separations indicated by the median barrier."
