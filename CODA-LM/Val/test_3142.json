Drivers behind this truck should be ready to brake or change lanes if it is safe.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue circular sign to the right which denotes a mandatory bicycle lane. This sign serves as a reminder to drivers to be mindful of cyclists who may enter the roadway abruptly.\n\nFurthermore, traffic cones are set up on the right side of our lane, signaling ongoing construction or roadwork and advising the vehicle to stay away from the edge and remain vigilant of nearby hazards or workers.\n\nLastly, temporary barriers have been installed on both sides of the road. This setup narrows the road, directing traffic and indicating that the space for navigation has been reduced. Yellow barriers on the left side delineate the construction site from the traffic flow, emphasizing that vehicles must not infiltrate the construction zone and stay alert for any activities that might spill onto the road.\n\nThe account does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects that might affect driving within the visible scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from large vehicles ahead, especially since their large size may obstruct the view ahead. Your vehicle should also be vigilant in observing the movements of construction vehicles, slow down when lanes narrow to safely maneuver, and be ready to stop or decelerate at any time to respond to any construction vehicles or workers entering the driving path. Additionally, if a large vehicle starts to merge, the driver should be prepared to adjust speed and lane position. Due to road construction marked by traffic cones, be aware of changes in the road surface and any signs indicating directions or changes in traffic patterns. Avoid distractions, and do not drive close to the road edges. Regularly checking rearview mirrors and blind spots is crucial for safe driving. Avoid the mandatory bike lanes and be cautious of cyclists who may suddenly appear. It is also advised to monitor any further traffic signs or signals that may arise.",
