A silver sedan is directly in the ego vehicle's lane, followed by a line of various cars, all traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from the silver sedan and prepare for possible stops or slowdowns due to the traffic ahead.\n2. A black car to the left of the ego car is also moving in the same direction, affecting the ego car's ability to change lanes to the left.\n3. A motorcycle is visible in the left lane next to the ego car, slightly ahead and traveling in the same direction. The ego car should be cautious of the motorcycle due to its smaller size and vulnerability, ensuring it does not merge into the same lane unexpectedly.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A pedestrian is crossing the street directly ahead of the ego car. The pedestrian has priority, and the ego car must yield until they have safely crossed.\n2. An officer in a high-visibility vest is stationed near a temporary roadblock to the right, indicating management of traffic. The officer's presence suggests a potential change in traffic patterns or road usage, which the ego car must be prepared to comply with.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. A pedestrian crossing sign is visible on the left side of the road, indicating a pedestrian crossing zone ahead, currently in use by a pedestrian.\n2. A 'No Parking' sign is attached to a barrier on the right, indicating no stopping or parking in that area. This area should be kept clear by the ego car, following the restriction for parking or stopping.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. Orange traffic cones are lined up along the right lane, resulting in a lane closure. The visibility of these cones indicates that the right lane is not available for use, and the ego car should stay in its current lane or prepare to merge left if needed.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Temporary barriers with attached 'No Parking' signs are placed on the roadside to the right, marking a restricted area. These barriers may narrow the driveable area, and the ego car must avoid them while maintaining lane discipline.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n1. A dustbin is visible on the sidewalk to the right. It does not impact the driving path of the ego vehicle, but it should be passively noted in case of any unforeseen movement onto the road.\n2. There are parked vehicles on the right side of the street. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from these parked vehicles to avoid any potential hazards like doors opening or pedestrians emerging."
