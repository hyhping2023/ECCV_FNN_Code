        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, two significant categories of road users and conditions present themselves: vehicles and other objects affecting visibility. \n\nFor vehicles, there are multiple cars parked on the right side of the road, identifiable by their illuminated rear lights, which could indicate they are either parked with their lights on or braking. The presence of these parked vehicles necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe distance to avoid potential hazards, such as sudden movements from the parked cars or the opening of doors. Additionally, another car is spotted further ahead on the same side, with its headlights on, facing towards the ego vehicle. This could imply that the car is either approaching or parked facing against the driving direction. The significant risk here is if the car is moving against the traffic flow or decides to turn into the lane of the ego vehicle, posing a potential danger.\n\nIn terms of other objects affecting visibility in the scene, there are conditions of low visibility attributed to poor lighting and a potential presence of rain. This reduced visibility necessitates a cautious approach, with slower speeds to ensure adequate time to detect and react to any unexpected hazards that might arise due to these conditions.\n\nThese observations underscore the importance of vigilance and maintaining safe distances from parked or approaching vehicles, especially under conditions of poor visibility, to ensure safe navigation through the traffic scene."

Maintain a lower speed to account for potentially lower traction and increased stopping distances. Be prepared for the possibility of parked cars entering the traffic flow and the presence of oncoming vehicles. Ensure headlights are on for visibility and be ready to react to any sudden movements from the parked vehicles, such as brake lights or turning indicators, that might signify a vehicle is about to leave its parking spot or merge into traffic. Constantly check for any movement from the parked vehicles or pedestrians that may be harder to see in these conditions."
