This truck reduces visibility around it and may make unpredictable movements due to its size and load.\n\nFurther ahead, multiple vehicle tail lights are visible in our lane and adjacent lanes, indicating traffic. This suggests that monitoring traffic flow and being prepared for potential speed changes or lane changes is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on the right side of the road indicating the direction of the road and the continuation of the current lane. This sign assists in understanding the lane layout ahead, confirming that the lane continues forward.\n\nLastly, a traffic light is visible in the distance, although its color state cannot be determined from the image. Identifying the state of the traffic light is crucial as it dictates whether the ego vehicle must stop, prepare to stop, or proceed."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle characterized by its rugged structure and visible equipment such as a large bucket. This type of vehicle indicates possible roadwork or a construction zone ahead. The presence of such a vehicle would prompt the ego car to reduce speed, increase vigilance, and potentially change lanes if the construction interferes with the current driving lane or if directed by road signs or workers. Road construction areas typically have lower speed limits and may require the driver to abide by the directions of temporary signage or traffic control personnel.",

Pay close attention to the traffic light as the ego car approaches to respond appropriately to its signal. Keep an eye on the traffic flow and watch for any brake lights from vehicles ahead, indicating a slow down or potential hazard. Be prepared to change lanes if the commercial vehicle is moving significantly slower than the rest of the traffic or if it starts to perform road work. Continue monitoring for any new road signs or traffic lights that come into view for further instructions."
