            "description and explanation": "The image shows a large public transportation vehicle designed to carry numerous passengers. This vehicle is commonly known as a bus. Its size and presence on the road demand cautious driving behavior from nearby vehicles. When driving in close proximity to such a vehicle, it is important to maintain a safe distance to accommodate its potential stops at scheduled bus stops and to be cautious of passengers that might be disembarking. Given its larger blind spots, the driver of the ego vehicle should be especially alert when overtaking or navigating around the bus.",

Its size and the potential for wide turns necessitate increased awareness from the ego vehicle driver. The driver should keep a safe distance to prevent any potential contact with the machinery. Additionally, the driver should be prepared for this construction vehicle to make unexpected maneuvers, such as changing lanes or slowing down to access a construction site.

It should maintain a safe distance from the construction crane vehicle and the white car beside it, and be alert to the traffic flow, which may slow down due to the vehicles ahead in the left lane. Overtaking may be unsafe or impossible due to the crane's size and lane restrictions; therefore, patience and caution are advised. Additionally, the car should prepare to follow the road as it bends to the right, in compliance with the mandatory direction sign. It should also monitor the neighboring vehicles, particularly the silver car to the left, to avoid any unsafe lane changes or merging. The ego car should also be ready to respond to the traffic lights in the distance when it approaches the intersection."
