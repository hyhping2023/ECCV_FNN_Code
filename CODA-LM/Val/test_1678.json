        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario observed, there are several notable road users and objects:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A white SUV is positioned to the right and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. It is important to watch this SUV closely for any potential lane changes.\n2. Various vehicles are observed ahead, both in the ego car's lane and adjacent lanes, with a dark-colored car directly in front of the ego car, all moving in the same direction. These vehicles' speeds and spacing will influence how the ego car adjusts its speed and considers lane changes.\n3. A bus is moving in the same direction as the ego car, in the left lane ahead. Since buses may stop often, it is vital to be prepared for changes in traffic flow.\n4. A motorcycle is noted ahead in the right lane, performing lane-splitting between a white car and a barricade. The ego car must be alert to the motorcycle's agile movements.\n5. A construction vehicle is parked alongside a barricade on the road's right side, possibly indicating upcoming construction, which might mean the ego car needs to slow down or change lanes.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. Cyclists are seen on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as traffic, necessitating that the ego car exercise caution when passing and remain vigilant for any changes in their path.\n2. Pedestrians are spotted near a crosswalk on the right, including one person on the median strip. It is crucial for the ego car to watch for any unexpected movements by the pedestrians.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. A No Parking sign along with an orange construction-related directional sign and various other informational signs are on the right side of the road, indicating changing road conditions ahead that may demand lane changes or speed adjustments.\n2. A speed limit sign indicating 40 km/h requires the ego car to modify its speed to comply with this limit for safe travel through the area.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. A traffic light with a red signal is visible ahead, signaling the ego vehicle must prepare to stop at the intersection.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n1. Orange traffic cones are aligned on the road's right side, leading to lane narrowing and signaling a construction zone, which means the ego car should navigate with increased caution and potentially at a reduced speed.\n\nBarriers:\n1. Temporary construction barriers are installed on the road's right side, accentuating the limited traffic lanes and highlighting the necessity for careful driving near the construction site.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. A construction crane is noticeable to the left beyond the barriers, denoting nearby construction activity and alerting to the possibility of unexpected obstructions or construction personnel entering the road."
