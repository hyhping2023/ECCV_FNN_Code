These signs are designed to guide traffic into the appropriate lanes for upcoming junctions. It is crucial for the ego car to be in the correct lane to follow the intended route.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones**: Orange and white traffic cones are arranged in a tapering formation, directing traffic to merge from the right-hand lane to the left. This indicates temporary changes to the traffic patterns, likely due to construction or road maintenance work ahead, requiring vehicles to shift away from the right-hand lane.\n\n3. **Barriers**: Yellow and red striped barriers are positioned on the right side, complementing the traffic cones by physically demarcating the restricted area of the road. These barriers are in place to protect the roadwork area and ensure that vehicles do not enter the hazardous or under-construction zone."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, which is commonly used to signal alterations in traffic patterns. It is typically bright orange with white horizontal striping for high visibility. Traffic cones are used to mark out construction zones or road work areas, delineate lanes, redirect traffic, or signal that drivers should move away from a certain space on the road. In this scenario, the positioning of the traffic cone would likely indicate to the ego car a need to stay within the lanes defined by these cones, signifying a potential hazard or change in the usual traffic flow ahead.",
