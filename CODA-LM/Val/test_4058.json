The truck's spinning drum indicates it is in operation. Due to the truck's large size and its operational state, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance for secure braking and to avoid potential debris falling from the mixer. The truck's size and position directly influence the following distance and potential maneuvering the ego car must maintain.\n\nAdditionally, there are parked cars on the right side of the road, varying in makes and colors. Notably, one of the parked cars has its brake lights on, which might suggest that it could enter into the traffic flow. The ego car should be prepared for potential obstacles entering its lane or for people getting in or out of the cars. Parked vehicles present a potential hazard as they may unexpectedly enter the road or pedestrians may emerge from between them, requiring vigilance from the ego vehicle.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian next to the parked cars on the right, standing close to the curb and facing away from the road, not appearing to attempt to cross at the moment. However, their proximity to the road means the ego car needs to monitor them for any sudden movements towards the roadway.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the scene."
