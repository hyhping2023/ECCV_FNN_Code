It appears to be stationary or moving slowly with its hazard lights on, necessitating a potential lane change by the ego car to avoid a rear-end collision and maintain traffic flow. Beyond this maintenance vehicle, several cars are parked along the curb in the right lane, which reduces the available lane width and may present risks if a car door opens or a vehicle pulls out unexpectedly. In the left lane, there is a steady flow of cars that might adjust their speed or merge due to the maintenance work, requiring the ego car to be vigilant for any sudden movements.\n\nAdditionally, a group of workers is present on the roadside next to the maintenance vehicle. Their proximity to the driving lane is a hazard, and the ego car should reduce speed and exercise caution to ensure their safety. A pedestrian crossing sign is also visible on the right side of the road, indicating that the ego car should be prepared for pedestrians that may cross the street ahead.\n\nTraffic cones have been placed between the maintenance vehicle and the left traffic lane, creating a barrier that outlines a work zone. These cones signal to the driver of the ego car to merge left if possible and to navigate the area with increased caution.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."

Additionally, due to the wet road conditions, it should employ cautious driving practices appropriate for the lower traction."
