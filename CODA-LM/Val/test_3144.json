The position and size of the truck could reduce the visibility ahead for the ego car and also restrict the available lane space for maneuvering."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a cement mixer truck directly in front of the ego car. This truck is noticeable due to its large size, occupying the same lane as the ego vehicle. It shows clear signs of recent use in construction, as indicated by wear and construction material residue, with its concrete chute extended to the side and its mixer drum looking dirty. This suggests there might be potential debris on the road which could be hazardous. The sheer size and purpose of the truck imply it might move slowly or stop suddenly for construction activities, affecting the ego vehicle's driving speed and the following distance. Moreover, the truck's position could limit visibility for the ego car driver and restrict maneuvering space in their lane.\n\nIn addition to the vehicle situation, there is a green traffic light ahead, indicating that vehicles, including the ego car, are legally allowed to move through the intersection or road section. This green light means the eco car can continue forward, but the driver must still be ready to stop should the light change or if any unexpected hazards arise on the road. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or notable objects are described in the scene, focusing attention on navigating the presence of the large vehicle ahead and obeying the traffic light's indication."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle equipped with a concrete mixer drum. Such vehicles are used on construction sites for mixing and transporting concrete. As the concrete mixer drum is extended beyond the back of the vehicle, the driver of the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid the risk of collision, especially when the mixer is in operation as it may be rotating. The ego car should anticipate any potential stops or slow movements by the construction vehicle, especially when approaching a construction site or when the construction vehicle is preparing to maneuver or discharge its contents.",

Be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the mixer truck's movements or position changes, and if the lane beside the truck is free and it is safe to do so, consider changing lanes to avoid being behind the truck. Since the traffic light is green, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, being mindful of the truck's potential to make sudden movements or stops and be vigilant for potential falling debris from the cement mixer truck. Continuous observation of the truck's indicators or brake lights can provide advanced warning of its intentions to maneuver."
