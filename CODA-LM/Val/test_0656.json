The positioning of this car suggests that it may merge into the same lane as one's own vehicle or cross through an intersection; therefore, the driver should monitor and adjust driving behavior accordingly."

The truck is significantly obstructing the path and may be at a standstill or preparing to turn, indicating that our car should slow down and be prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary."

        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene depicted contains two vehicle types. Firstly, a white sedan is identified in the lane adjacent and ahead, parallel to our vehicle. This sedan's placement might influence decisions regarding lane changes and adjusting speed since it could potentially merge into the same lane or cross an intersection. Monitoring and modifying driving behavior accordingly is advisable to preempt any sudden maneuvers the sedan might undertake.\n\nSecondly, a heavy vehicle adorned with yellow and red stripes is positioned directly ahead, spanning across lanes and seemingly engaged in stationary work or performing a specific task. This vehicle serves as a direct obstruction, requiring a reduction in speed or a change of lanes when it's safe. The presence of the truck implies it might be stationary or preparing for a turn, which should prompt our vehicle to decelerate and be ready to stop or navigate around the truck as necessary.\n\nNo other road users, signs, lights, cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are reported in this traffic image, highlighting the primary importance of addressing vehicle-related challenges in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "During the parking process, the driver should pay attention to the white sedan on the left, which may cross or merge into this lane. The presence of heavy vehicles also means there might be road construction or temporary obstacles; the car should proceed with caution. After the green light is on, if it is safe and legal, consider changing lanes. Given the current traffic conditions, the car should slow down and be prepared to stop or change lanes if the path is blocked by a truck ahead. Even though the green light indicates the right of way, the presence of trucks means that one must drive cautiously. Drivers should assess the situation, taking into consideration road markings and oncoming vehicles that may not be visible from the current perspective, to determine if it is safe to overtake. In addition, continue to monitor the white sedan on the left to ensure it does not affect the maneuvering space or safety of this vehicle.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large heavy vehicle designed for transportation of goods or materials. Due to its size and weight, the future driving behavior of the ego car may involve maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for the truck's potentially slower acceleration and longer stopping distance. It is important to keep a larger safety gap when driving behind such a vehicle to react in case the truck stops suddenly or makes unanticipated movements.",
