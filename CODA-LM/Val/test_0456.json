        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are two noteworthy observations regarding the road users. Firstly, on the sidewalk to the right side of the ego car's path, there's a pedestrian walking parallel to the road. While this individual is not directly on the road, it's imperative to keep an eye on them in case they decide to cross unexpectedly, suggesting a need for vigilance from the autonomous vehicle to anticipate and react to potential pedestrian movements. Secondly, there are dogs lying on the road on the right side, which might pose a potential hazard. The presence of these animals requires the autonomous vehicle to exercise extra caution and be prepared to either stop or slow down promptly to prevent a collision. This readiness is crucial to safely navigate situations where animals may move unpredictably, presenting an unpredictable risk to the vehicle's path."

In a traffic context, if it's not secured or attended by an owner, a dog can represent an unpredictable element. An autonomous vehicle should be cautious when a dog is detected nearby, as it may enter the roadway unexpectedly. The presence of this animal would necessitate the ego car to potentially slow down and be prepared to stop to avoid a collision should the dog move into the car's path.",
