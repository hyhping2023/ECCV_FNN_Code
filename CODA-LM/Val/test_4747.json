        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two noteworthy elements affecting the driving environment.\n\nFirstly, we have a parked car located on the right side of the road, aligned in the same direction as the ego vehicle. It's notable that there are no visible occupants within the car nor any activities around it. This parked vehicle serves as a potential hazard as it reduces the available roadway width for the ego car to maneuver. Furthermore, there's a risk associated with it potentially beginning to move or someone opening a door unexpectedly, which the ego vehicle must be prepared to respond to.\n\nAdditionally, surrounding this parked car, a series of red and white traffic cones have been deployed, effectively partially obstructing the traffic lane. These cones are indicative of a temporary road obstruction or perhaps a work zone, which signals to the ego vehicle that a deviation from the usual path of travel or a reduction in speed might be necessary to safely navigate this section of the road.\n\nIn this scenario, the focus for the ego vehicle would be on actively monitoring these elements to adjust its path or speed as needed, ensuring safe passage through the area. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this image that impact the driving conditions, making the parked car and the associated traffic cones the primary points of interest."

Prepare to steer slightly left to avoid the traffic cones while ensuring no oncoming traffic is present. Maintain a safe distance from the parked car in case the doors open or it begins to move. Use the car's headlights and possibly high beams (if there's no oncoming traffic) to increase visibility, and prepare to stop if any unforeseen hazards arise."
