The vehicles in the scene include a large white RV moving in the same direction as the ego car, traveling on the right lane of a two-lane road. The size and position of the RV must be considered by the ego car when contemplating lane changes or overtaking maneuvers. Additionally, there are several cars ahead that are stopped at a traffic light, influencing the ego car's need to adjust speed and maintain an appropriate stopping distance.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image hence these categories can be disregarded.\n\nA key regulatory element in the scene is a blue rectangular traffic sign positioned on the right side of the road, which imposes a speed limit of 20 km/h. The ego car is required to comply with this speed restriction on this particular stretch.\n\nMoreover, the traffic lights for the direction the ego car is heading are red, mandating that the ego car comes to a full stop at the intersection. This is essential for the safety of all road users and the smooth operation of traffic at the junction."
