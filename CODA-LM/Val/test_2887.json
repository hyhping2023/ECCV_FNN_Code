        "description and explanation": "In the scene before us, we have a white truck filled with steel pipes positioned directly in front of our autonomous vehicle, occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. Due to the substantial size of the truck and the nature of its cargo, which could potentially shift, it's essential that the autonomous vehicle maintains a safe distance behind the truck to be ready for any unexpected stops or movements.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white van in the lane to the left of the autonomous vehicle, which is also travelling in the same direction. This van restricts the option for our vehicle to safely change lanes to the left unless there is a sufficient gap. Thus, the autonomous vehicle must continually assess the van's speed and position to identify a moment when it is safe to switch lanes, should the need arise.\n\nAlong the road, there is a yellow traffic sign with a black arrow pointing to the right. This sign indicates an approaching change in the road direction, specifically a right turn. The autonomous vehicle is advised to prepare for a road curve and the intersection ahead. It may need to adjust to changes in traffic flow or priority, which could be influenced by the upcoming bend.\n\nTo the right of the autonomous vehicle's lane, a series of orange traffic cones are organized, demarcating the lane's edge. These cones alert the autonomous vehicle of potential hazards or ongoing maintenance on that side of the lane. The vehicle must remain within the boundaries of the lane, and depending on the cones' placement, may need to merge left if the lane ahead is closed or if traffic is being directed into its lane due to the lane works. \n\nIn this image, there are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, no active traffic lights to consider, nor any barriers or miscellaneous objects that would impact the autonomous vehicle's navigation choices."

It acts as a temporary sign to indicate areas where vehicles should not pass, such as construction zones or traffic accidents. The cone's bright color ensures high visibility. In the driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone signifies that the ego vehicle should remain within the guided path or lane to avoid hazards associated with the closed-off area.",

Do not attempt to overtake using the right side of the lane due to the line of traffic cones possibly indicating road work or a hazard. Monitor the van's speed and position in case a safe opportunity to change lanes arises, and remain vigilant for any road users that might emerge near the crossroad. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, be prepared to merge left if necessary, and approach the upcoming right-hand curve with caution. Reduce speed if necessary to allow for safe merging and navigation of the turn."
