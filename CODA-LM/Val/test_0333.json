This indicates that traffic is either slowing down or has stopped, suggesting that our vehicle should be ready to slow down or stop as well. Alongside, a large truck is partially visible on our right in the right lane, limiting our vehicle's maneuverability and field of vision. Extra caution is needed if considering a right lane change. Furthermore, several cars in the left lane are moving slowly or are stopped, as indicated by their brake lights, affecting our vehicle's potential to change lanes or merge.\n\nAdditionally, there is an orange traffic cone positioned on the left side of our car, in front of a detour sign, denoting a possible construction area ahead or a lane closure. Lastly, scattered debris or small objects are present on the road near the traffic cone on the left. This debris could pose a risk, and our vehicle might have to navigate around it while maintaining lane integrity. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in this traffic scene."

Stay alert to changes in traffic flow that may result from the indicated detour routes. Continue to monitor surrounding vehicles, especially the large trucks on the right, to prevent unsafe lane changes. Avoid any debris on the road and do not make any sudden movements that could jeopardize traffic safety.",
