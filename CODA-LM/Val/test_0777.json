This vehicle should be monitored as it may enter the intersection once the traffic signal changes, potentially crossing the path of the ego vehicle if both receive a green light.\n\nThe traffic light visible to our vehicle is red, indicating a stop is required. However, there is a green arrow allowing for a right turn, which suggests that the vehicle can proceed in that direction if it complies with traffic rules.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones on the left side of the intersection, marking an area that should be avoided. These cones suggest the presence of road work or obstacles, and the vehicle should navigate around this area.\n\nLastly, there is a piece of trash resembling a plastic bag on the road within the pedestrian crossing zone. This object could be misinterpreted as an obstacle by the vehicle's sensors or could distract the driver, and therefore it should be noted by the autonomous driving system."

    "driving_suggestion": "When the red light is on, the vehicle should come to a complete stop at the intersection. If the road is clear and legal, a green arrow permits a right turn. Watch for the black car in the left lane, and prepare to move forward when the green light is on, while being cautious of the designated area on the right. However, due to the wet road, extra caution is needed. Debris on the road currently poses no direct danger, but it is important to be aware of whether it may move into the path of the vehicle. If turning right, the driver should ensure no pedestrians are crossing the street, be mindful of other vehicles that may also be interacting with the intersection, and drive carefully because the tire traction may be reduced.",

Known as a bus, it has a distinct elongated shape and windows along its side, designed to carry multiple passengers at once. In the context of autonomous driving, the presence of this vehicle should lead to the ego car maintaining a safe following distance and preparing for potential stops or slow-downs as buses frequently halt at designated stops to pick up or drop off passengers.",

The ego car must be prepared to stop or safely maneuver around the dog if necessary, while also ensuring not to endanger the animal or violate traffic rules.
