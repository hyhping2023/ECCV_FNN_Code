The bus's turn signal suggests it might enter the lane of the ego vehicle, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust speed or change lanes to maintain safety.\n  - A cement truck is directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the same lane. Given the size and weight of the cement truck, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance, as the truck's braking distance might be longer than that of a passenger vehicle.\n  - A white sedan is visible ahead and to the right of the cement truck, traveling in an adjacent lane. The position of the sedan does not immediately affect the path of the ego vehicle, but it should be monitored in case it decides to change lanes or adjust its speed.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - There are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists affecting the current driving scenario, so no immediate action is required regarding vulnerable road users.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - An overhead electronic sign positioned to the right, ahead of the ego vehicle, is partially obscured, and its content is not visible. The obscured sign could contain important information about the road ahead, such as lane closures or congestion; however, since it's not legible, it can't be used to inform driving behavior at this moment.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A traffic light beyond the bus on the left is displaying a green light for the lane going straight and a red light for the left turn lane. Since the ego vehicle is not in a left turn lane, the green light indicates it's clear to continue moving forward.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - A row of trees and shrubbery is present to the right, which does not impose any direct impact on the roadway or the driving behavior. These elements are part of the road's natural environment and typically do not interact with traffic unless there is unexpected debris falling onto the roadway."

Regular checks in rearview and side mirrors are recommended to stay aware of any changes in the traffic situation around the ego vehicle."
