        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, several road users are present across multiple categories.\n\nAmong the vehicles, there is a black vehicle parked on the right side of the road, partially blocking the lane, which may pose a danger by reducing the lane width and requiring other vehicles to detour. A silver car is stopped on the right, in front of the SUV, and if it needs to go around the parked SUV, it may cause an obstruction. Additionally, there is a dark-colored car stopped at the center of the intersection ahead, slightly tilted to the left, indicating it may be preparing to turn left or is waiting to turn. Its position and orientation suggest it is part of the traffic flow and could impact the ability to proceed.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, a pedestrian wearing a green top is crossing the street with a package but not using the designated crosswalk, necessitating immediate action to ensure their safety. Another pedestrian is walking along the left side of the road in the same direction, which, though not a pressing concern, requires attention to prevent them from crossing the street or affecting traffic flow. Furthermore, a delivery worker on a two-wheeled vehicle is traveling in the same direction as the car, located between a parked silver vehicle and the lane, and may exhibit unpredictable movements such as merging into the traffic lane.\n\nA yield sign is also present on the right side of the road, indicating the need to give way to oncoming traffic or other road users. This sign is crucial for indicating a potential merge or intersection, requiring self-driving vehicles to be prepared to yield."

    "driving_suggestion": "Slow down and prepare to stop for pedestrians crossing the road. Pay attention to yield signs. Monitor parked vehicles and pedestrians at the roadside for any behavioral changes that could affect traffic flow. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Your own vehicle should also be attentive to parked vehicles along the side of the road, making slight steering adjustments or changing lanes if necessary, while cautiously managing oncoming traffic at intersections. As you approach an intersection, drive cautiously and be prepared to yield to oncoming vehicles that are stopped at the intersection and pedestrians that are crossing. Moreover, keep a safe distance from delivery workers and be alert for any sudden movements from them or the parked silver car.",
