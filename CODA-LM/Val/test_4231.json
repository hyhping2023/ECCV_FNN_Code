The vehicle must maintain a safe distance while overtaking and be prepared to decelerate or change lanes if necessary to avoid getting too close to the cyclist. Additionally, there is a motorcyclist traveling in the same direction as our vehicle and positioned in front of the bicycle. Motorcyclists necessitate caution as they might suddenly change their position or speed.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, two are present: a yellow warning sign on the right side of the road, reminding the vehicle to slow down and proceed with caution, and a no U-turn sign on the left side, indicating that U-turns are not allowed at the intersection.\n\nFor traffic lights, the light above our lane displays a green signal, indicating that the vehicle can proceed but should remain cautious due to the presence of other road users and the potential for the traffic light to change.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the road, specifically a series of red and white cones closing off the far left lane, indicating that it is prohibited for use. The vehicle may need to merge into another lane if it is in the affected lane.\n\nLastly, there are barriers present; red and white plastic barricades on the left side of the road indicating an ongoing construction or road work area. Such barriers mean that the vehicle must drive cautiously and might need to slow down or change lanes.\n\nNo other objects are observed in the image."
