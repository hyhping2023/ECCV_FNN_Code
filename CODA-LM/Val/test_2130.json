Additionally, a red bus is present in the adjacent lane, moving in the same direction, which means the ego car needs to be cautious of any potential obstacles or stops that might cause the bus to slow down or change lanes. Directly in front of the ego car is a black car with its brake lights illuminated, indicating that it is slowing down or stopped, and the ego car should be ready to do the same.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, there are lane narrowing or merge signs, indicating that the right lane will be closed ahead and traffic should merge left. This requires the ego vehicle to pay extra attention and be prepared to allow other vehicles to merge.\n\nThe image does not contain any traffic lights.\n\nThere are multiple traffic cones on the right side of the road, suggesting lane narrowing or roadwork. These cones direct vehicles to avoid the right lane and potentially merge into other lanes, which affects the flow of traffic and necessitates careful driving.\n\nConcrete barriers are visible on both sides of the ego car's lane, limiting lateral movement and indicating a constrained roadwork zone that the ego car must navigate through.\n\nOther objects in the image include the reflection of the ego vehicle's dashboard on the windshield and trees on the side of the road. The dashboard reflection does not impact driving, but it is noted for visibility conditions, especially if it is bright or distracting. The trees do not directly affect driving unless they block the road."

Caution should be taken due to the road's wet state and limited maneuverability caused by barriers and traffic cones. Maintain a safe following distance from vehicles ahead, be prepared to reduce speed due to the traffic situation, and be ready to merge left in response to the lane closure due to roadworks. Monitor the surroundings for any abrupt changes in traffic flow or further lane restrictions and adjust speed accordingly."
