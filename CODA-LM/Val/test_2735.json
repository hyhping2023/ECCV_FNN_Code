On the right side, there is a large construction vehicle with a concrete mixer, which extends into the lane of the ego vehicle. Its main cabin is partially obscured, and the mixer shows signs of regular construction use. This vehicle is a significant hazard for the ego car due to its size and the need to navigate around it safely.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light on the left side of the image displays a red signal. Consequently, the ego car must either prepare to stop or remain stationary if it is already at the stop line.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Recognizable by its rotating drum and the chute that is used to pour concrete, this large vehicle typically moves at a slower pace and makes frequent stops at construction sites. The proximity of this vehicle suggests the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards associated with the truck's operation, such as unexpected movements or debris falling from the rotating drum.",

The driver needs to assess the available space on the road, check for any oncoming traffic that might obstruct a lane change, and proceed with caution. If the road does not permit a safe pass, the ego vehicle should remain at a stop until the construction vehicle moves or another path becomes clear. Additionally, the ego car should reduce speed to account for the potentially slippery road conditions caused by the wet road surface and prepare to stop due to the red traffic light ahead. Increased following distance should be considered due to the reduced traction, and the ego car should be prepared for potential unexpected movements from the construction truck on the right."
