The sedan has its tail lights on, which suggests that it is either moving or ready to move. The ego car must, therefore, keep a safe distance behind this sedan and stay alert for any signs of braking that could indicate the sedan is slowing down or coming to a stop.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign on the right side of the road. This sign could be indicating a detour or a change in road conditions that lie ahead. As a result, the ego car should be prepared to adjust its navigation according to the upcoming traffic pattern changes.\n\nFurthermore, red and white safety barriers are present on the right-hand side of the road. These barriers likely signify that there are roadworks or a section of the road is not accessible. The ego car will need to be cautious, taking into account the possibility of a narrowed road or other potential hazards in the area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
