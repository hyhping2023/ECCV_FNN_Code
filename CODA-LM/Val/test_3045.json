        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a white SUV parked on the side of the road, oriented parallel to the road. This vehicle is stationary and does not currently affect the ego vehicle's path, but it is important to monitor it for any signs of movement or pedestrians that may affect traffic flow. Additionally, there is a series of cars parked on the right side of the road, which narrows the usable road width and could potentially hide moving vehicles or pedestrians, requiring the ego vehicle to remain cautious.\n\nOn the road, there are vehicles in the opposite lane with their headlights on, indicating active traffic and necessitating careful maneuvering. Furthermore, multiple vehicles are driving in the same direction as the ego car, as indicated by their position and visible tail lights. The behavior of these vehicles will influence the ego vehicle's driving decisions, such as maintaining safe distances and being prepared for any changes in speed or direction.\n\nA traffic light is visible in the distance with a red light illuminated on the right side of the road, past the parked vehicles. This red signal means that the ego car must stop at the upcoming intersection and approach with caution, ready to respond to the traffic light's indication as it becomes clearer upon approach.\n\nAdditionally, there is a road-sweeping vehicle parked on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from this large, parked vehicle to avoid any potential obstacles. Lastly, the street lights are on, suggesting a nighttime setting. The lights can cause reflections or shadows that may affect the perception systems of autonomous vehicles, so caution is advised. However, the street lights also improve visibility, which is crucial for the ego car's decision-making processes at night."

Stay in the current lane, while being aware of the parked vehicles on the side, especially the road-sweeping vehicle, in case they become active on the road. Give parked cars a wide berth to account for pedestrians that might emerge. Regularly scan the road ahead for any unexpected obstacles or movements from the parked vehicles. The ego vehicle should maintain a vigilant scan of the surroundings, particularly looking out for the parked white car pulling out into traffic, keep a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, and be prepared to stop or slow down depending on the state of the upcoming traffic light. Nighttime driving requires heightened awareness, and the ego car should use its headlights and pay attention to reflective surfaces that may indicate the presence of other road users or changes in traffic conditions. Progress cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from parked vehicles on the side of the road. Prepare to stop at the intersection ahead due to the red traffic light. Be vigilant for any unexpected movements from parked vehicles or potential pedestrians in the area, and reduce speed as necessary to ensure safe navigation through the active parking area."
