        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements interacting with the ego vehicle. Directly in front of the ego car, within the intersection, a white sedan is positioned, sharing the same direction of travel. The presence of this sedan is critical as it dictates that the ego vehicle must halt and maintain a safe following distance, since traffic appears to be stopped. To the left, reflected in the side mirror, there is a blue car situated close by, possibly in an adjacent lane or passing by. This blue car affects the ego car's ability to switch lanes or execute a turn. Furthermore, across the intersection, there are vehicles queued up awaiting their chance to proceed, providing context for the traffic flow and indicating when the ego vehicle might expect to have the right of way to move through the intersection.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, a cyclist clad in a pink shirt and white helmet is observed traversing the pedestrian crossing just ahead of the white sedan, necessitating the ego vehicle to yield and allow safe passage due to the cyclist's right of way. Off to the right side of the frame, pedestrians can be seen stationed behind signage, seemingly poised for the crosswalk signal to permit their crossing. Their potential to step onto the roadway requires the ego car to stay vigilant for their impending crossing action.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road within the image, a 'No Left Turn' traffic sign is prominently displayed, flagging down any considerations for left-hand turns at this particular junction and thus shaping the intended route for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic scene includes a visible red traffic light situated above the intersection directly in the path of the ego car. This signifies that the ego car is required to come to a complete stop and await the green signal before it can advance.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that would influence the driving decisions of the ego vehicle."

The driver must also remain vigilant for cyclists and other vulnerable road users crossing the intersection until the light changes to green, at which point they can safely proceed straight if the intersection is clear."
