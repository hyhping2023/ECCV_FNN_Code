The truck is partially obstructing the driving lane, which could limit the visibility for the ego car and may also block the road. Consequently, this requires the autonomous vehicle to navigate around the truck with caution to ensure safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, a blue dustbin is present on the right edge of the driving lane. It appears to have been blown over or moved from its original position, posing a potential hazard. The ego car will need to maneuver around this obstacle carefully, ensuring that it does not enter the opposite lane of traffic while avoiding the dustbin.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers captured in this traffic image, leaving the ego car to contend with just the parked truck and the displaced dustbin."

Avoid abrupt maneuvers around the dustbin and any other potential hazards on the road."
