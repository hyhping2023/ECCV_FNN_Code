This vehicle's proximity and behavior directly affect the ego car's speed and following distance.\n  - A white van is visible in the oncoming lane, moving in the opposite direction relative to the ego vehicle. It does not directly affect immediate driving decisions but should be monitored for any unexpected lane changes or obstacles that may cause the van to swerve.\n  - A white vehicle is partially visible on the right, ahead of the black sedan, positioned diagonally as if indicating a merge or lane change. This vehicle's uncertain movement could impact the traffic flow, necessitating the ego car to be prepared to adjust its speed or change lanes.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - There is a triangular warning sign on the right side of the road, above the roadside barrier, indicating an upcoming intersection or merge point. This sign advises the driver to anticipate potential merging vehicles or changes in traffic patterns.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Multiple traffic cones are set up on the right side of the ego car's lane, leading up to a point where the lane appears to be merging or tapering off. These cones define the travel path, implying a narrowing of the lane, requiring the ego car to adjust its position accordingly.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - A roadside barrier is visible beyond the warning sign on the right side of the road, potentially indicating construction or road maintenance ahead. This barrier may define restricted areas, impacting lane availability and navigation routes.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - A large yellow and red drum is seen on the left, possibly indicating construction or lane management.
