Firstly, there are No parking signs on the right side of the road, adjacent to the sidewalk, which inform drivers that parking is not permitted in this area, ensuring that vehicles do not stop or park here. Additionally, a red circular sign with a white horizontal bar in the center is visible on the right side, indicating that vehicle traffic is prohibited from entering the road ahead.\n\nThe traffic lights include a green pedestrian signal on the right side of the road, which means that pedestrians are allowed to cross the street, and autonomous vehicles must account for this in their driving decisions.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, signaling that the rightmost lane is closed and suggesting that vehicles in this lane should merge left.\n\nLastly, yellow and black temporary barriers are installed on the right side of the road, demarcating a construction area from the part of the road that is open to vehicles. This indicates that there may be road construction ahead, which could affect the lane width and would require vehicles to slow down and exercise caution while passing through the area.\n\nThere are no other objects reported in the image."
