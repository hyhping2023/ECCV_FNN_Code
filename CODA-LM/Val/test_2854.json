However, there are three traffic cones placed in the middle of the road, which are brightly illuminated by the vehicle's headlights, causing a noticeable reflection. These cones suggest that there is road work or some sort of obstruction on the road ahead, and as such, the ego car must be prepared to navigate away from that lane if necessary. The presence of these traffic cones typically indicates road work, an obstruction, or a temporary change in traffic patterns, and in this instance, they seem to be blocking off a section of the road, requiring drivers to maneuver around them.\n\nFurthermore, there are large round objects near the center of the road, resembling construction barriers or lane dividers that are commonly used in areas undergoing maintenance or construction. These objects may be obstructing the path or indicating temporary changes in traffic flow, necessitating increased vigilance and the possibility of taking detours by the drivers. No other barriers or objects are reported in the image."

The driver should also increase following distance to account for the possibility of reduced traction on the slick surface. Given the wet road conditions and potential obstructions, the ego vehicle should reduce speed, increase following distance, and prepare for potential maneuvers to avoid the round objects in the road. The driver should observe any additional traffic signs or signals that may indicate detours or specific instructions due to roadworks."
