Its operations can cause debris or lead to sudden stops, affecting traffic flow and the ego car's ability to pass safely. This vehicle is obstructing the right lane and partially the left lane, posing a hazard that requires the ego car to reduce speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance and pass safely."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a yellow construction vehicle with its bucket or chute raised, actively engaged in work and partially blocking the road ahead on the right side. The vehicle's extended arm is reaching over the median, encroaching slightly towards the center of the road. This construction vehicle poses a potential hazard as it could move unexpectedly or drop materials onto the road, which could affect the flow of traffic and necessitate sudden stops. Due to its position, it is obstructing the right lane and partially the left lane, which requires the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance and navigate past the vehicle safely. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data, indicating that these categories are not present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A large vehicle with a mechanical structure typical of those used in construction is present. Its size and functionality suggest it is designed for tasks such as excavating, lifting, or transporting heavy materials commonly found on construction sites. The future driving behavior of the ego car will likely be influenced by this vehicle's presence by necessitating a reduction in speed and an increase in caution. The ego car may also need to be prepared to stop or navigate around the construction vehicle, depending on the road conditions, traffic regulations, and the actions of the construction vehicle.",

If the lane is partially blocked, the ego car may need to wait for a clear path or cautiously pass if it's safe and there is enough space. Constant vigilance is needed in case debris falls from the construction vehicle. Maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden movements from the construction vehicle. If there is an opportunity to pass safely, and if passing is allowed on this road, the ego vehicle should do so with caution, checking for any oncoming traffic or signals from the construction vehicle indicating it is safe to pass. Reduce speed and prepare to either stop or carefully change to the left lane if it is safe to do so. Monitor the situation for any changes, such as movements from the heavy machinery or indications that it may be clearing the lane. Always ensure to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead."
