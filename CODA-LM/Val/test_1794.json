Since the road lacks visible lane markings, remain vigilant for any on-road activity from the pedestrian, possible vehicles or other road users that may enter the roadway unexpectedly. Additionally, the driver should be vigilant for possible road obstructions and changes in road conditions due to the presence of debris."
