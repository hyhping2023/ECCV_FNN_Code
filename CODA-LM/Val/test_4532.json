    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance behind the stationary SUV and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the SUV does not start when the road is clear. Pay attention to the status of traffic cones on the side of the road for clues on lane merging or changing. Since the traffic light is green, anticipate that the SUV may start soon, and if conditions permit, prepare to cautiously pass through the intersection. The vehicle should also be aware of oncoming traffic and follow the lane directions indicated by the blue road signs. In the event of any unforeseen circumstances, such as pedestrians or cyclists suddenly emerging from parked vehicles or work areas, the vehicle must be ready to stop or safely maneuver to avoid collision.",

It is often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed for emergency repairs or utility work. This particular traffic cone indicates that the ego car should not move towards the area where the cone is placed and suggests caution, perhaps due to a hazard or ongoing road work.",
