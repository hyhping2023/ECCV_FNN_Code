        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are no vehicles present, but there are notable observations concerning vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, and other objects which impact driving behavior.\n\nA medium-sized dog is seen walking on the left side of the road, heading in the same direction the ego car might be traveling. The presence of animals on or near the roadway is significant as they are unpredictable and can change direction or enter the roadway suddenly, posing a potential hazard to safe driving.\n\nThere is a traffic sign noted on the left side of the road. It is a circular sign with a white border, a blue background, and the number '10' displayed in white. This sign is identified as indicating a maximum speed limit of 10 km/h. Adhering to this speed limit is necessary for the ego car to comply with local traffic regulations and ensure safety.\n\nNo traffic lights or traffic cones are reported in the scenario.\n\nA barrier observed is a graffiti-covered wall on the right side of the road. While the barrier itself, such as a graffiti-covered wall, doesnâ€™t directly influence driving behavior, it is indicative of a narrow roadway with limited escape routes. This is important for emergency maneuvers and overall cautious driving.\n\nOther observed objects include graffiti on the wall on the right side of the road. The graffiti on its own does not affect driving conditions, but it could be indicative of the general state of the environment and the potential for unexpected road users or behaviors in the area that require heightened awareness and caution from the driver."

As a traffic policeman, it is critical to monitor the movements of animals close to the roadway, as they can unpredictably enter the street, potentially causing hazardous situations for both the animal and oncoming traffic.

Given the road conditions, increase following distance and brake early when stopping. Furthermore, it is recommended to steer slightly to the left to maintain a safe distance from the right-side barrier while still staying in the lane. Constant observation of the roadside and any changes in the road's condition or the dog's behavior is imperative."
