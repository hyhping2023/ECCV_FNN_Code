Additionally, a pedestrian standing between the construction site and the parked SUV is interacting with the workers, which could lead to unexpected movement into the roadway, requiring caution from the ego vehicle.\n\nThere is also a yellow construction zone sign mounted on a pole to the upper right of the image, indicating the work period and informing drivers of the need for caution due to the presence of workers or machinery. Orange and white traffic cones are positioned around the construction area, marking a zone that vehicles should avoid entering and helping guide traffic safely around the site.\n\nOther noticeable elements include an overhead tangle of wires and a wall-mounted outdoor air conditioning unit above the construction site. While these do not directly impact the ego vehicle's immediate path, they signify urban infrastructure related to the construction work that warrants awareness."
