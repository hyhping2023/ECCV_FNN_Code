The presence of the forklift suggests potential nearby construction or loading activities. This could affect the traffic flow and may require the ego car to either change lanes or reduce speed to navigate safely around the potential moving obstacle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead of the ego car displaying a red signal. This requires the ego car to stop at the intersection to comply with traffic rules and to avoid running the red light, ensuring safety and adherence to traffic laws.\n\nAlongside these, a green barrier is present, running parallel to the right side of the road along the ego car's lane. This barrier likely indicates an area of roadwork or a zone that is off-limits to vehicles. It underscores the importance for the ego car to remain in the current lane and not to cross into the restricted area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
