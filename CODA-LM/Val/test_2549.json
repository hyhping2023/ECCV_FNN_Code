Stay in the current lane if not taking the upcoming exit. Be alert for the unspecified hazard indicated by the warning sign, and adjust speed accordingly. Continue to observe the surrounding environment for any changes that might affect driving behavior. Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, be prepared for slower traffic due to the right exit lane, and watch for any road users who might be changing lanes to take the exit. Since the road ahead appears clear and there are no immediate hazards or traffic lights visible, continue at a safe speed while being ready to adapt to changing road conditions or traffic signs that may come into clearer view. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, keeping in mind that the truck's large size might obscure potential hazards on the road ahead. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to adjust speed or switch lanes if necessary due to the warning indicated by the traffic sign. The driver should monitor the condition of the truck, as such large vehicles can sometimes lose debris. Since there are no visible traffic lights or cones, and with the road in good state, normal caution for highway driving applies."
