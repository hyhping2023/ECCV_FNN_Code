This truck affects driving behavior as its size and position necessitate either maintaining a safe following distance or safely overtaking if possible. The truckâ€™s load may cause debris to fall, and it could maneuver unpredictably.\n\nNo identifiable traffic signs are visible in the image, meaning standard road rules apply without the need for specific adjustments based on signs. A traffic light is seen at an intersection ahead, but its current state is unclear. Its eventual state will dictate whether the ego vehicle should stop, proceed cautiously, or continue without delay.\n\nMetal guardrails are present on both sides, marking lane boundaries and restricting overtaking. These barriers ensure the ego vehicle remains within its lane, providing guidance for safe travel.\n\nThere are street lamps, ongoing construction on the left side beyond the guardrail, and a bus stop on the right side. These objects do not directly impact immediate driving behavior but contribute to situational awareness, such as potential pedestrian activity near the bus stop."

Keep an eye out for potential construction signs or signals that may require changes in driving behavior, and only consider overtaking the truck if it is safe and legal to do so, after assessing the traffic in the adjacent lane. Stay alert for other road users and obstacles that may emerge from the construction area. Be prepared for possible congestion or slow-down due to any construction activities indicated by the roadside barrier. Regularly check mirrors and blind spots for any vehicles that may overtake or enter the lane from the bus stop area. Continue to monitor the road for any changes in traffic signs or signals."
