        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, various elements contribute to the driving environment that necessitates cautious navigation by the ego vehicle. \n\nFirstly, a white car is noted to be driving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, moving further away. The presence and movement of this car necessitate that the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance and stays prepared for any potential maneuvers that might be required. Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road. While these parked cars are not directly obstructing the ego vehicle's pathway, staying aware of them is essential. This caution is due to the possibility of one of these vehicles starting to move unexpectedly or an individual exiting the cars, which could influence the ego vehicle's driving decisions.\n\nRegarding road signage, a 'No Parking' sign is visible on the right, highlighting parking restrictions in the area. Although this sign does not immediately affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, since parking is not intended, its presence communicates important regulatory information. Moreover, a round, blue sign featuring a white arrow pointing upwards is situated to the right under an overpass. This sign serves to direct the road use ahead, indicating the direction for the ego vehicle to follow.\n\nThe traffic light situation indicates a green light overhead, granting the ego vehicle the right to proceed without the need for stopping. This green signal directly influences the driving behavior, allowing continued forward movement.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are observed, indicating areas of potential road work or hazards. Some cones are placed far to the right, marking an area likely unused by vehicles but suggesting the need for the ego vehicle to stay vigilant for any unforeseen obstructions or workers. A single cone is also positioned on the left road edge, hinting at temporary road works or obstacles and advising the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the left side.\n\nLastly, yellow and black striped barriers are found at the sides of the road, particularly at the support pillars of an overhead structure. These barriers serve a cautionary purpose, warning drivers of stationary obstacles near the roadway and aiding in the prevention of collisions with the pillars.\n\nThis detailed observation of the traffic scene underscores the importance of the varied elements present and their respective implications on the driving decisions and safety measures necessary for the ego vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker, typically made from plastic or rubber, that is used to guide traffic, mark off construction sites or areas where road work is being conducted, or indicate areas not to be accessed by vehicles. The presence of a traffic cone on the road suggests caution, possibly indicating road work ahead or a hazard on the road that drivers should avoid. In the current driving scenario, the ego vehicle needs to ensure it does not drive over or too close to the cone, maintaining safe passage and possibly adjusting its trajectory slightly to avoid it.",
