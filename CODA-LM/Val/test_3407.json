This vehicle reduces the available space on the road and could make a sudden lane change or stop, necessitating adjustments in speed or position by the ego car. Additionally, a yellow work vehicle is parked in the right lane, partially visible behind road workers, indicating ongoing road work ahead and necessitating a change in traffic patterns and safe navigation around obstructions. A blue public transport bus is also traveling on the opposite side of the road, implying the presence of a bus lane or stop, which is relevant for traffic flow but does not require immediate action from the ego car.\n\nSeveral road workers in high-visibility orange vests are occupying the right lane and working on road infrastructure. Their presence necessitates the ego car to ensure their safety and be prepared for potential unexpected movements into its path.\n\nThere are no visible traffic signs, meaning the ego car must rely on road markings, signals, and heightened situational awareness. Similarly, there are no visible traffic lights, requiring adherence to standard right-of-way rules and any temporary directions from road workers.\n\nTraffic cones are placed around the workers, partially blocking the right lane and providing a visual barrier to guide traffic. These cones indicate changes in the usable roadway, requiring vehicles to slow down or shift lanes.\n\nTemporary barriers and various work equipment are positioned at the roadside, limiting road accessibility and requiring careful navigation.\n\nLastly, debris is present on the road near the workers and traffic cones on the right side, posing a potential hazard and necessitating careful navigation and possible lane changes to avoid it."
