For safety, the rider and the passenger are both wearing helmets. Notably, there is a small dog running close by to their right side. This situation implies a potential for unpredictable behavior, which can be a hazard. Due to the proximity of the motorcyclist and the presence of the dog, it is necessary for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance behind them, allowing sufficient space to respond to any abrupt movements or potential stops that might occur."

Prepare to brake earlier than usual if the motorcyclist slows down unexpectedly, and proceed with additional caution to account for the reduced traction. Be prepared to slow down or stop if the animal enters your driving path. Monitor for any further developments that may require a change in driving behavior."
