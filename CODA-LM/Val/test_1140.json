This suggests that the construction vehicle is likely involved in active construction or maintenance work, obstructing the roadway, and could potentially move or commence operation, posing a hazard to the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, blue construction barriers are visible on both sides of the road. Though not traditional traffic signs, they signal ongoing construction work, serving a similar purpose to 'road work' signs by delineating the construction area and modifying the drivable space. These barriers hint at potential lane restrictions or closed lanes ahead, necessitating caution from the ego car.\n\nMoreover, a blue barrier is also visible to the right side of the road, extending along the edge of the roadworks area. This barrier highlights the presence of roadworks, indicating a potentially narrowed roadway and requiring careful navigation when passing by."

It is sizable, with a front loader bucket indicating it is possibly engaged in active construction or transport of materials. The presence of this vehicle may indicate construction activity nearby which could lead to reduced lanes, detours, or slow-moving traffic. The ego vehicle must approach with caution, be prepared to stop or slow down, and obey any temporary traffic signs or signals that may be in place due to the ongoing construction.",
