There is a bus on the left side of the intersection, which is stationary and may be occupied, as indicated by the interior lights. The presence of the bus is significant because it could start moving when the traffic lights change, potentially crossing the path of the ego vehicle. A line of cars is stopped at the intersection, facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle, suggesting a red light for their direction. These vehicles may affect the timing for the ego vehicle to proceed when their light turns green.\n\nAdditionally, the intersection contains scattered vehicles, including a van and a motorcycle further ahead, whose unpredictable movements may affect the ego car's path. Vulnerable road users are also present, with a pedestrian and their dog crossing the road on a zebra crossing to the right, requiring the ego vehicle to ensure their safe passage. A motorcyclist in the middle of the intersection has just crossed facing the ego car's direction, directly affecting the ego vehicle's immediate path. A cyclist is also waiting in the center of the intersection to the left, necessitating careful observation by the ego vehicle to ensure their safety.\n\nThe traffic light visible ahead to the right is showing green for traffic going across the ego car's path and red for the left turn, indicating that the ego car must remain stopped until the signal changes to green, while other vehicles are permitted to cross the intersection. No traffic signs are clearly visible in the image that affect immediate driving behavior, and there are no traffic cones or barriers present.\n\nLastly, there are various lights and reflections in the image, which could potentially cause distractions or glare, but they do not present a direct challenge to navigation. The driver should maintain focus and not be distracted by these lights and reflections."

Once the traffic light turns green for the ego car's direction and the pedestrian and motorcyclist are no longer in the car's path, the ego car can then proceed with caution, keeping an eye out for any other vehicles that begin to move in the intersection. Additionally, the ego vehicle must monitor the traffic and vulnerable road users closely to ensure a safe and legal movement once the light turns green, giving way to pedestrians and cyclists who may have priority. Careful acceleration and awareness of the surrounding traffic, including the bus on the right and the vehicles in motion, will be necessary when proceeding."
