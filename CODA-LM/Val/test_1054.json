        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a white hatchback car on the right side of the road, facing away from our vehicle, and it is partially blocking the lane. The presence of this car is significant because if it were to make any sudden maneuvers, such as turning or reversing, it could pose a risk to our vehicle. Therefore, our autonomous vehicle should remain alert and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there is a tricyclist riding in the opposite direction on the right side of the road. Tricyclists can be less visible and may make unpredictable movements. As a result, our autonomous vehicle should ensure it gives them enough space and be ready to react if the tricyclist enters our lane unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, a green trash bin is situated very close to our vehicle on the right edge of the road. Trash bins near the roadway can be hazardous if they are hit by vehicles or if they are moved onto the road. To mitigate this risk, our autonomous vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the trash bin.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that need to be considered."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed and keep a safe distance from the three-wheeled vehicle ahead. If the speed of the vehicle is slower than the traffic flow, be prepared for a possible overtaking maneuver. Exercise caution when approaching a three-wheeled vehicle stopped at the roadside, to prevent being obstructed by pedestrians or other vehicles hidden by it. Drive on the left to avoid nearby trash bins and potential sudden movements at the roadside. Drive carefully, ready to stop or slow down for the green three-wheeled vehicle on the right, and pay special attention to the riders of the three-wheelers, leaving them ample space when overtaking. Moreover, continuously monitor for any sudden movements at the roadside, especially near trash bins and in areas with road surface shadows. Self-driving vehicles should slow down and prepare to safely overtake bicycles, ensuring that this is done without oncoming traffic. Self-driving vehicles should also closely watch for any sudden movements from three-wheeled vehicles and hatchbacks parked at the roadside. Additionally, the vehicle should slightly turn to the left to maintain a safe distance from the green trash bins on the right side of the road.",

It appears to be a manually powered mode of transportation, often used for carrying goods or passengers. The driver of the ego car needs to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to slow down or stop to avoid a collision since these vehicles can be slower moving and less predictable than standard motor vehicles.",

In traffic, this kind of vehicle may move slower than cars and may also navigate or change directions unpredictably, especially if it is human-powered. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include slowing down when approaching the tricycle, maintaining a safe distance, and being prepared for any sudden movements the tricycle might make. Overtaking should be done with caution, ensuring there is ample space to pass safely.",
