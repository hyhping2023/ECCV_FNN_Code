This is due to the truck's potential to obstruct the driver's vision and its capability to make unpredictable movements.\n\nSimultaneously, several cars are traveling in parallel lanes to the left of the ego car and are moving in the same direction. The close proximity of these vehicles demands vigilance, as their potential lane-changing moves could impact the ego car's trajectory.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there is no immediate action required by the ego vehicle since there are no visible signs dictating specific responses.\n\nThe absence of new traffic lights in the image indicates that the ego car should continue with general caution, ready to adhere to traffic signals as they become visible further along the road.\n\nThere are temporary barriers installed on the left side of the road, delineating the drivable surface from pedestrian and construction zones. These barriers may reduce the available road width, thus influencing the ego car's lane positioning.\n\nFinally, shared bicycles are stationed in a designated zone on the right side of the road. Although they do not pose an immediate obstruction to the driving path, the probability of people approaching to use the bicycles requires constant attention to the potential emergence of pedestrians in this area."
