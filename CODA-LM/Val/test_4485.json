While the van is not currently obstructing traffic, it is important to be aware of it in case it moves unexpectedly. Additionally, there are large cable reels positioned close to the edge of the road. These reels could potentially limit the available driving space, so it is necessary for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance to avoid them. Furthermore, the air quality appears to be compromised with a visible buildup of smog or fog, leading to reduced visibility. This condition could affect the performance of the vehicle's sensors and the driver's ability to see, which means that the ego vehicle should proceed with reduced speed and heightened caution. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

From the perspective of a driver in the ego car, these objects do not directly influence the immediate driving behavior unless they encroach onto the roadway. However, if such spools were to roll or shift into the path of the ego vehicle, they could pose a threat.

Additionally, the vehicle should have its lights on to increase visibility to others."
