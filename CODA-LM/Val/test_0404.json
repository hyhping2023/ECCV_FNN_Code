This van may decelerate, come to a sudden stop, or change lanes, which could affect the flow of traffic and require adjustments to the speed and position of this vehicle. Additionally, a green construction vehicle is parked on the right shoulder, partially blocking the right lane. This situation demands that this vehicle proceed with caution and, if safe, consider merging to the right.\n\nConcrete barriers and metal guardrails are also installed to separate the lanes of opposing traffic. These obstacles indicate the drivable area and ensure that the vehicle remains in the correct lane, preventing head-on collisions."

Drive carefully, and if necessary, merge to the right to avoid construction vehicles parked in a way that obstructs the road. While observing speed limits and other potential traffic signs, keep a safe following distance behind the gray car ahead. Be prepared to slow down if the dump truck in front indicates deceleration or stopping. Remain in your current lane, and do not attempt to cross the median barrier. Periodically check your rearview mirrors to stay informed about the surrounding traffic and be ready for potential overtaking. Continuously monitor road conditions to adapt to any changes.",
