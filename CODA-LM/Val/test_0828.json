        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that affect driving behavior:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A yellow trailer is parked at the right edge of the road, partially occupying the lane, with its rear facing our vehicle. This may block part of the lane, reducing the maneuverability of autonomous vehicles, and may necessitate a lane change or a reduction in speed to maintain safe driving conditions.\n2. Several cars are parked on both sides of the road, with a metal fence and a row of trees on the right, which limits the available operating space. Parked vehicles reduce the width of the lane and may obstruct the view of other road users, presenting hazards such as opening doors or pedestrians stepping out. The autonomous vehicle must monitor these vehicles and drive carefully.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A person riding a bicycle is ahead on the right side of the road, parallel to a parked trailer. Cyclists may encounter dangers or decide to change direction or merge into a lane, requiring the vehicle to monitor and adjust speed or lane position to ensure safety.\n2. Pedestrians are walking along the side of the road and on the distant sidewalk, passing through the central divider and metal railings, located opposite our vehicle. The vehicle must monitor their movements in case they attempt to cross the street or step onto the roadway, necessitating caution and vigilance.\n\nBarriers:\nA metal fence separates the sidewalk and parking line from the road, clearly demarcating the pedestrian areas from the vehicular lanes, ensuring autonomous vehicles remain on the traffic lanes and stay alert to potential crossing points.\n\nOther Objects:\nTrees and shrubs on the right side separate the sidewalk from the road. While not obstacles, they may hinder the visibility of pedestrians trying to cross the road, requiring extra caution from self-driving cars.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the trailer ahead and be ready to change lanes when necessary, ensuring safety. It is crucial to monitor the trajectory of bicyclists, and when overtaking, make sure there is a sufficient gap. Observe carefully for any potential obstacles or movements from trailers, bicyclists, or pedestrians before passing the trailer. Maintain continuous watch over pedestrians close to the roadway. Your vehicle should also keep a safe distance from the black car ahead in the left lane and be prepared to slow down or stop. Considering the dry road conditions, it is important to maintain lane discipline and adhere to road markings. Drive carefully and adjust your speed appropriately.",

            "description and explanation": "A large yellow construction vehicle is pictured occupying the lane directly ahead of the ego car. It likely belongs to a nearby work site and is either moving to a different location or is part of an active construction project on the road. Due to occupying the lane, the vehicle necessitates that the ego car must slow down and possibly change lanes to continue driving safely and follow traffic rules. The ego car should watch for any signals from the construction vehicle or workers that might indicate whether it's safe to pass or if a stop is required.",
