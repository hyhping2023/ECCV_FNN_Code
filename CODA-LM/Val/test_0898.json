This vehicle is significantly large and may be slow-moving, potentially obstructing the flow of traffic."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several points of interest:\n\nFirstly, there is a large yellow crane truck with red and white stripes for visibility, with the branding 'XCMG'. It occupies the right lane ahead of the ego car, and due to its size and potential slow speed, the autonomous vehicle will need to maintain a safe distance and possibly change lanes if its speed is impeded.\n\nFollowing the crane, there is a light-colored compact vehicle maintaining a safe distance. The behavior of this vehicle is crucial to observe as it may need to adjust speed or change lanes in response to the crane truck's movements.\n\nA dark-colored car is also present, following the construction vehicle. The ego car must keep a safe following distance from this vehicle as well.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there is a cyclist riding a three-wheeled vehicle, carrying a load secured with a tarp. Additionally, a motorcyclist is sharing the same lane as the ego car on the right. The cyclist could pose a risk due to potentially slower speeds and sudden movements, while the proximity of the motorcyclist necessitates careful observation to prevent any collision if they alter speed or change direction.\n\nOn the roadside, a blue rectangular sign with white lettering suggests a place name or direction. Although it doesn't require any immediate action, it's a navigational element signaling a potential intersection or merging traffic, which the autonomous vehicle should take into account.\n\nLastly, a metal railing runs along the right side of the road adjacent to both the crane and the cyclist. This barrier confines road users to the roadway and consequently reduces the space available for the ego car and others to maneuver around the large crane and other traffic participants.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in this scene."

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle is present, characterized by a bulky shape, bright yellow color, and reflective markings. The vehicle appears to be stationary or moving slowly, and is taking up a significant portion of the roadway. Its presence necessitates cautious driving by the ego car, possibly requiring a reduction in speed and an increased following distance to account for its size and potential movements. The ego car should be ready to react if the construction vehicle makes unexpected maneuvers or if construction activity is taking place nearby.",

While doing so, it should carefully monitor the motorcyclist and the cyclists on the left, ensuring not to make any abrupt lane changes that could endanger them. All maneuvers should be executed with a high degree of caution due to the two-way street with no clear lane separations. The ego car should also be attentive to any potential merging traffic from the side road indicated by the blue sign."
