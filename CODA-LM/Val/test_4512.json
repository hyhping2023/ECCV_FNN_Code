Metal barriers are seen on the left side, delineating the separation of oncoming traffic lanes and guiding the ego car to stay within its lane.\n\nLastly, there is a stack of construction materials on the side of the road, along with visible piles of dirt and machinery, indicating an active construction site. These objects could present hazards if materials were to spill onto the road, necessitating vigilance from the ego vehicle."
