        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several vehicles ahead on the right side of the ego car. Some of these vehicles are in motion, while others might be parked. The moving vehicles may slow down, stop, or change lanes unexpectedly, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and stays alert to react accordingly. The parked vehicles contribute to a reduction in road width and could potentially hide pedestrians from view.\n\nAdditionally, there are approaching vehicles on the opposite lane, visible by their headlights. The presence of oncoming traffic requires the ego car to maintain strict lane discipline to prevent the risk of head-on collisions and to manage the glare from the headlights.\n\nA reflective traffic sign is also present on the right side of the road; however, its details are unclear due to the low light conditions and the quality of the image. Despite this, the sign could contain critical information that might influence driving decisions, such as speed limits or hazard warnings.\n\nNo traffic lights are discernible in the image, which implies that the ego car should adhere to standard traffic rules and observe the behavior of other road users to proceed safely.\n\nYellow and black traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, signaling potential road works or obstacles ahead. These cones indicate that the drivable road space may be reduced, and the ego car must maneuver around them with caution.\n\nThere is a continuous yellow barrier on the right side, delineating the separation between the road and the sidewalk. This barrier serves as a physical boundary that the ego car must not cross, thereby limiting the available space for driving.\n\nDue to the low light conditions and the quality of the image, no other objects such as debris or dustbins can be distinctly made out. The limited visibility under these conditions requires the ego car to exercise increased vigilance for any unexpected obstacles that may arise."

Road rollers are typically used for compacting materials such as soil, gravel, concrete, or asphalt in the construction of roads and foundations. In this context, its presence indicates that there may be ongoing construction or repair work on or near the roadway. The ego vehicle must be prepared to encounter possible disruptions to the normal flow of traffic, including reduced lanes, detours, or slow-moving equipment. The driver should be cautious and alert, ready to follow any temporary traffic signs or signals and adjust speed accordingly to ensure safety near the construction zone.",

Proceed with caution due to low visibility and maintain a safe distance from both the moving traffic ahead and the parked vehicles on the right. Pay attention to any potential indicators from the traffic sign once within visible range. Reduce speed and stay alert for any construction or pedestrian activity around the traffic cones and barriers. In case of any sudden changes in road conditions or obstacles, be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully."
