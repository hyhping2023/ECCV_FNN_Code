        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, a variety of road users and objects influence the driving environment for autonomous vehicles. Firstly, a large red truck is parked on the left side of the road, facing the opposite direction of the self-driving vehicles. This parked truck, while not a moving hazard, narrows the roadway and potentially obstructs visibility for other road users or hidden hazards for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nIn the realm of vulnerable road users, a motorcyclist and a cyclist are present in the rightmost lane, situated just ahead of an autonomous vehicle. These individuals are particularly significant as their smaller size and potential for abrupt movements require autonomous vehicles to maintain a safe following distance and remain prepared for sudden stops.\n\nThe traffic situation is further defined by a red traffic light positioned above, directly in the driving path. The red signal mandates that vehicles, including autonomous ones, must halt at the intersection and await the green light to proceed safely.\n\nIn addition to these elements, a metal fence is noticed on the right side of the scene. This fence serves as a barrier that delineates the road boundaries, impacting the navigational decisions of autonomous vehicles by limiting their lane usage.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any traffic signs, traffic cones, or miscellaneous objects, suggesting a relatively uncluttered driving environment outside of the mentioned road users and the traffic light scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light and the stationary state of other vehicles, this vehicle should come to a complete stop at the intersection. Caution is needed to maintain a safe distance from motorcycles and bicycles ahead. Before preparing to move forward, the vehicle should stay alert to changes in traffic lights and the dynamics of road users, including motorcycles and bicycles. Due to slippery road conditions, the vehicle should reduce speed to accommodate longer braking distances and improve control. This vehicle should also monitor for any signs of the truck on the left departing or having obstructed visibility. The vehicle should remain stationary until the traffic light turns green, ready to proceed with care.",
