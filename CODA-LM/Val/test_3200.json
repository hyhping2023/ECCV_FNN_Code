It is angled across both its own lane and partially into the left-hand lane, which may slow down traffic and require self-driving vehicles to change lanes due to the restricted space on the road. Additionally, multiple vehicles are observed in the left lane, all traveling in the same direction as our vehicle, indicating the direction of traffic flow and the need for our car to adjust speed or change lanes to navigate around the agricultural vehicle.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a small group of pedestrians, including a person in pink clothing who might be on a bicycle or motorcycle. Although they are not on the road, their proximity to the street could pose a potential risk if they were to accidentally enter the traffic lanes.\n\nFurthermore, a green fence has been installed on the right side of the road, acting as a barrier between the road and the sidewalk or construction site. This barrier guides vehicles by marking the edges of drivable roads and ensures that vehicles stay in the correct lane.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should slow down to ensure safety while passing the agricultural vehicle ahead. Considering the larger size of the vehicle occupying the left lane, as well as the presence of other vehicles in that lane, our vehicle should be prepared to signal and change lanes safely when necessary. The driver should also monitor the flow of traffic in order to merge back into the right lane safely after overtaking the agricultural vehicle, and continue to comply with road rules. Maintain the current lane position, follow the signs for two-way traffic, and be vigilant of oncoming traffic that may affect subsequent driving decisions.",

The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance, being prepared for potential stops or slow movement, and exercising caution when considering overtaking or changing lanes around it.",
