Additionally, there is a black SUV in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. The positioning of this SUV indicates it is sharing the road with the ego car, so any maneuvers like changing lanes or braking will directly influence the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nSeveral orange traffic cones are aligned on the left side, creating a barrier between the driving lane and an adjacent worksite. These cones suggest that part of the road might be closed off for construction or maintenance, requiring vehicles to merge right if needed and to watch for possible obstacles or workers near the roadside.\n\nMoreover, metal barriers are present on the right, separating the road from the pedestrian walkway. These barriers protect pedestrians and indicate that no crossing or merging should be expected from the right side."
