        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present. However, there is a notable presence of traffic management tools and signs. Specifically, there is a circular speed limit sign situated on the right side of the road, indicating a speed limit of 40 km/h. This sign is accompanied by an additional sign below it, suggesting that the speed limit is temporary, likely due to road conditions or ongoing roadworks. The ego car, therefore, must comply with this temporary speed limit for safety and legal reasons.\n\nAdditionally, multiple traffic cones are arranged in a line along the rightmost part of the road, guiding vehicles towards a merging action to the left. The placement of these cones suggests that the rightmost lane may be closed ahead or there is a road hazard, necessitating vehicles to prepare for a merge to the left to avoid the obstruction.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, yellow and black barriers are positioned on the rightmost part of the dual carriageway. These barriers reinforce the separation from the lane closure or works area, serving as a physical deterrent to prevent vehicles from entering potentially hazardous or closed-off sections of the road.\n\nLastly, a large temporary roadwork sign is placed in the right lane, explicitly informing drivers of upcoming roadworks. This sign serves as a confirmation of the roadworks ahead, emphasizing the importance for vehicles to adhere to temporary traffic regulations and reduced speed limits to ensure safety through the construction or maintenance area."
