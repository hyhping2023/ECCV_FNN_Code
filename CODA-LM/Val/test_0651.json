                "explanation": "The truck's size and proximity might limit visibility for the ego car, making it important to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or turns the truck may perform. Due to the truck's size and position, it may limit the visibility of the ego car driver to see the road ahead and any potential hazards that may arise from that direction. Also, if the truck is moving slowly, the ego car may need to prepare for a lane change or adjust speed accordingly. The proximity of the truck to the ego car influences the ego car's available maneuvering space and requires careful monitoring in case the truck begins to move or if its operation affects the ego's path."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large yellow truck with Chinese characters visible. This vehicle's cargo area and rear dual-tired wheels are in view, and the truck seems to be stationary because there's no motion blur. The presence of this truck impacts the driving behavior of the autonomous car, as the vehicle's size and close proximity can obscure the driver's view of the road ahead, potentially concealing upcoming hazards. Maintaining a safe following distance and remaining alert for any sudden maneuvers by the truck is critical for safety due to the reduced visibility. Additionally, the ego car must be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary, considering the limited space for maneuvering that the truck's presence creates. The car's driving system is tasked with close monitoring to anticipate if and when the truck might start moving or how its actions could intersect with the trajectory of the ego car.\n\nNo other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

The container's sheer size and bulkiness suggest that the ego car must maintain a safe distance to avoid any collisions, especially since large vehicles have significant blind spots and may make wide turns.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck due to its large size and potential to obstruct visibility. Prepare for possible stops or slow movement by the truck and observe for any indicators of such actions, like brake lights or turn signals. Regularly check mirrors to be aware of other vehicles that might approach from behind or attempt to overtake. Since the road surface appears clear and dry, continue driving with normal caution appropriate for roadway and traffic conditions. Given the limited information from the single image, it is important to maintain a safe following distance from the truck to ensure there is ample time to react to any potential hazards that may come into view. Be prepared to reduce speed or change lanes if necessary, depending on the truck's actions and the availability of clear adjacent lanes. Constantly assess the surroundings for additional cues on road conditions and traffic dynamics that are currently not visible from this image. Maintain a safe distance from the commercial vehicle, prepare to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential hazards from the truck's movements or operations onsite. Regularly monitor the rear-view mirrors and blind spots for any other vehicles that may affect lane changes or other maneuvers. Proceed with caution and be ready to stop or yield if the truck engages in unexpected activity."
