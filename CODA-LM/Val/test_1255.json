These vehicles have reflective surfaces that shine due to the headlights of the ego car and come in various colors and sizes. The cars are parked in a disorderly fashion, which potentially narrows the drivable path. The presence of these parked vehicles reduces the available lane width and maneuverability, creating a potential hazard. The ego car must be cautious to navigate through the narrowed path without colliding with any of the parked cars. There is a risk of doors opening suddenly or pedestrians stepping out from between the parked cars, which the ego car needs to anticipate and avoid.

Be prepared to stop or maneuver around unexpected hazards. Maintain a heightened awareness of the potential for hidden dangers due to parked cars and poor lighting conditions. Ensure to keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles to avoid collisions with car doors being opened or pedestrians that might appear suddenly. Turn on the vehicle's headlights if they are not already on, reduce speed to accommodate the narrow passage between parked vehicles, and be prepared to stop or yield if the car with headlights on begins to move. Additionally, increase following distance and braking distance due to the potentially wet road surface."
