        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that the ego car needs to consider:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A white van is diagonally ahead on the right side, relative to the ego car's path, and it appears to be either moving forward or preparing to join the traffic flow. The presence of the white van may influence the ego car's trajectory if it enters the lane or stops abruptly.\n2. There is a darker colored moped to the left of the road, positioned ahead of the ego car, and it is traveling in the same direction. Since the moped is in motion, it may adjust its speed or direction unexpectedly, compelling the ego car to regulate its velocity and keep a safe distance.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. On the right sidewalk, there's a pedestrian walking away from the street without any signs of planning to cross. Although the pedestrian doesn't currently pose a risk to the flow of traffic, they should be kept under observation in the event they decide to head toward the street.\n2. A motorcyclist is seen on the left, moving along a path parallel to that of the ego car. The motorcyclist might switch lanes or alter their speed, necessitating the ego car to change its speed or lane position accordingly.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. No traffic signs that directly affect the ego vehicle's immediate driving route are discernible in the image. Although this does not currently affect driving behavior, the driver should remain vigilant for any signs that could appear shortly.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n1. Several traffic cones are positioned to the right, marking off part of the road, presumably not designated for vehicle use. These cones suggest areas the ego car should avoid, possibly reducing the width of the usable road and thus requiring careful driving.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects indicated in this image that affect the current driving scenario."

Placed on roads or footpaths, it usually signifies temporary traffic conditions and warns drivers of roadworks, obstacles, or potential hazards ahead. In the context of the future driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of a traffic cone indicates that the driver should stay alert, reduce speed, and possibly prepare to change lanes or navigate around an obstruction.",

Maintain a safe following distance from the moped, be prepared to react if the moped's behavior changes unexpectedly. Proceed with caution due to the presence of traffic cones, being mindful of possible road work or obstacles ahead."
