        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, various road users and objects are present, each affecting the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles in distinct ways. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there are three notable instances:\n1. A white car is traveling on the left lane in the opposite direction, slightly ahead. This vehicle necessitates that self-driving cars might need to change lanes or adjust their speed to maintain a safe distance.\n2. On the right, another vehicle moves opposite to our direction, positioned ahead. This implies that an autonomous vehicle should be cautious, possibly changing lanes or preparing to stop or turn, keeping a vigilant eye on this car’s movements.\n3. Across the road, a partially visible white truck appears either stationary or moving slowly. While it currently poses no immediate threat, its presence demands attention in case it decides to cross into our path or interacts with other vehicles unpredictably.\n\nConcerning vulnerable road users:\n1. A cyclist is moving parallel to the traffic flow on the far right. This requires autonomous vehicles to be cautious when changing lanes or turning, ensuring a safe distance is maintained from the cyclist.\n2. Pedestrians are observed on the sidewalk to the right, with one near the edge of the crosswalk area, suggesting that they might attempt to cross the road. Autonomous vehicles need to be ready to stop or slow down to prevent any potential accidents.\n\nAs for the traffic signs, there are both no parking and no entry signs visible by the roadside. These signs are crucial for informing autonomous vehicles about road rules, especially regarding areas where stopping or driving is restricted, indicating a need for heightened attention in these zones.\n\nThe traffic light scenario indicates a green light above our lane, permitting vehicles to pass through. Autonomous vehicles must take this as a cue to proceed at legal speed limits while being mindful of other road users’ movements.\n\nTraffic cones arranged in alternating red and yellow patterns on the right signify a construction zone or lane closure. It stresses the importance for vehicles to steer clear of the cones-demarcated area and stay alert to any sudden changes in road conditions or movements by road workers.\n\nLastly, barriers placed along the right edge of the pedestrian path delineate a construction or work area, marking it as restricted. These barriers serve to guide both pedestrian and vehicular traffic, ensuring safety by clearly indicating areas that are off-limits.\n\nThis comprehensive overview delivers an in-depth understanding of the diverse elements within the traffic scene that are vital for autonomous driving decisions, highlighting the intricate interplay of road users, traffic control devices, and temporary road condition markers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed at the speed limit and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Especially when changing lanes, watch for bicycles on the right side to avoid getting too close. Be aware of road construction areas marked by traffic cones, and be prepared for possible lane changes or roadside workers. Continuously monitor any changes in the traffic lights. Be ready to adjust your speed or direction for potential pedestrian crossings, and stay clear of construction areas marked by traffic cones.",
