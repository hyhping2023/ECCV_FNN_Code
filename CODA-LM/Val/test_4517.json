        "description and explanation": "In reviewing the traffic scene, I observe several key elements. Firstly, there is a large green-cabbed truck parked on the right side of the road. It is partially encroaching upon the shoulder and also extends into the driving lane, presenting a potential hazard to oncoming traffic. Consequentially, the autonomous vehicle must be ready to either slow down or switch lanes to safely navigate past this obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dark-colored car parked on the right-hand side of the road. Although it is not blocking the main thoroughfare, caution is advised since there's an element of unpredictability; it might pull out into the lane without warning.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic includes vehicles traveling in the opposite direction within the other lane. These oncoming vehicles could pose a risk, especially if they veer out of their lane or in situations where our vehicle might need to maneuver around an obstacle in our own lane.\n\nLastly, there are multiple overhead lines intersecting above the roadway. While they do not directly affect driving behavior, their presence warrants attention as they might be indicative of an impending intersection or a set of crossroads that could influence traffic dynamics."

    "driving_suggestion": "Slow down and be prepared to change lanes to the left when necessary to safely overtake the obstructing truck. Watch for any unexpected movements from parked cars on the right. Continue to monitor the traffic lights to ensure you have the right of way when approaching an intersection. Maintain a safe following distance, and use turn signals to communicate with other road users when changing lanes. Additionally, be cautious of oncoming traffic when maneuvering around the parked truck. Due to the reduced grip from the wet road, our vehicle should slow down and prepare to change lanes safely in order to avoid the partially parked truck. Meanwhile, keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and pay close attention to oncoming traffic to react accordingly.",

Considering its position on the road, it seems to be either parked or moving slowly. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid getting too close to the construction vehicle. This ensures the safety of all road users and adheres to traffic laws regarding overtaking and following distances.",
