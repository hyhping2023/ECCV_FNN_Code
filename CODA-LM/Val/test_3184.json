The presence of this truck limits visibility for the ego car and necessitates maintaining a safe following distance to react to potential sudden stops or changes in the truck's speed.\n\nAdditionally, there are several vehicles ahead in the adjacent lanes, including a white vehicle on the left. These vehicles may perform lane changes or slow down the traffic flow, which requires the ego car to monitor them closely for safe lane positioning and to adjust speed accordingly.\n\nA red traffic light is also visible in the distance ahead, positioned above the roadway, signaling the ego car to stop at the upcoming intersection.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic lights ahead are showing red for the left turn lane and green for the through lanes. This means that the ego car must continue following the green light while remaining vigilant for traffic that may cross from the left turn lane if the ego car is proceeding straight.\n\nLastly, there are street lights illuminating the road, which provide essential visibility for safe driving during nighttime conditions."
