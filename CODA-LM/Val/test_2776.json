Vehicles:\n   - A white SUV is directly in front of the ego vehicle, skewed slightly to the left. The brake lights of the SUV are on, indicating it is slowing down. Therefore, the ego vehicle should also prepare to reduce speed or stop to maintain a safe following distance.\n   - To the right and slightly ahead, there is a tanker truck that is skewed towards the ego vehicle's lane. The truck's position could be a hazard, especially if it begins to change lanes or stops suddenly, and the skew suggests the possibility of a lane change or lack of lane discipline.\n   - A white sedan is in the rightmost lane, positioned slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. The sedan's location and potential movements need to be monitored to prevent any issues when the ego vehicle is changing lanes or adjusting speed.\n\n2. Traffic cones:\n   - On the left side, there are traffic cones indicating the separation of lanes or a section of the road that is closed. The positioning of these cones requires the ego vehicle to stay within the boundaries of the current driving lane and adhere to traffic regulations without moving into the space on the left.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions."

Maintaining a moderate speed and heightened awareness of the environment is recommended until clearer information becomes available."
