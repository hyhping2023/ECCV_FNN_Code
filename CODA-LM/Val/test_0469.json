        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of vehicles of note. Firstly, a white sedan is traveling in the same direction as the ego car, located in the left lane. It is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from the sedan and be alert for any sudden stops or changes in the sedan's speed. Additionally, there is a yellow construction vehicle on the right, occupying the rightmost lane and partially the next lane to the left, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The construction vehicle's large size and positioning may block the view ahead and disrupt the flow of traffic, so caution is advised, and the ego car may need to consider changing lanes.\n\nRegarding road infrastructure, there are road signs on the right side of the road; however, the details on these signs are not clear from the ego car's current position. Despite the lack of legible information, it is important to stay vigilant for potential upcoming road changes or conditions that these signs might indicate.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple orange traffic cones lined up on the right side of the road, beginning near the construction vehicle and continuing forward. These cones likely denote a work zone or an obstruction, signaling that the ego car should keep a safe distance and be ready to merge to the left if it becomes necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy construction vehicle, possibly a road roller or a similar piece of construction machinery used for road works. It is identifiable by its large cylindrical drum and its bulky, industrial appearance. The presence of such a vehicle on or near the roadway influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and preparedness for potential road work ahead, unexpected maneuvers, or a reduced speed limit. The driver of the ego car should stay alert and be ready to adjust their speed or switch lanes if necessary to maintain safety and comply with any traffic conditions or signs present due to the construction works.",

No lane changes are currently indicated, but situational awareness should be maintained."
