        "description and explanation": "The scene in question includes various road users and objects that the ego vehicle must consider. Directly in front of the ego car, there is a white sedan occupying the same lane with its brake lights on, signaling that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance and be prepared to slow down or stop in reaction to the leading vehicle's actions.\n\nOn the right shoulder of the road, there is a parked three-wheeled vehicle positioned with its side facing the ego vehicle. This vehicle has bright lights and appears to operate as a street food vendor. Though stationary, it could become a distraction or an obstacle, particularly if any sudden movements occur from the vehicle itself or pedestrians surrounding it.\n\nNear this food vendor, on the right side of the road, stands a group of pedestrians who are turned away from the ego vehicle. Their proximity to the roadway and the food vendor indicates that the ego vehicle should keep a watchful eye on them in case they enter the road unexpectedly.\n\nThe traffic light in view is showing green for traffic moving perpendicularly across the intersection, while the ego vehicle's path is controlled by a red light. A visible number '24' suggests a countdown, likely indicating the time remaining before the light changes. Consequently, the ego vehicle is required to remain stationary until it is permitted to proceed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dustbin located near the food vendor on the side of the road. While it is static, the dustbin could create potential roadblock hazards, especially in combination with the nearby pedestrian activity. The ego vehicle should be aware of its presence but does not need to undertake immediate action regarding it.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the scene."
