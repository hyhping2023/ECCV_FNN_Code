The truck has a worker in the driving seat and a raised bed at the back, suggesting it may be in the middle of operations. This truck is partially in the same lane as the ego car and could potentially start moving or perform maneuvers that could affect the flow of traffic.\n\nSeveral pedestrians are crossing the street at a crosswalk in front of the ego car, with some of them looking at their phones while walking. Because pedestrians have the right of way at the crosswalk, the ego car must stop and allow them to pass safely. Additionally, a cyclist is on the right edge of the road moving in the same direction as the ego car. The proximity of the cyclist to the travel lane requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to alter its path if necessary to avoid getting too close.\n\nThere are no visible traffic signs in the image, which means the ego car must rely on road markings, signals, and general rules of the road for navigation and safe operation.\n\nA traffic light located on the right side of the road, visible just above the construction truck, is displaying a red signal. The red light indicates that the ego car must stop at the intersection and wait for the signal to change to green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, a dustbin is observed on the right side pavement next to the cyclist. While the dustbin doesn't directly affect the path of the ego car, it indicates potential nearby pedestrian activity that could spill onto the road."
