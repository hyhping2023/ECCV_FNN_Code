It might also obscure the view of the road ahead, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible stops or slow movement."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several noteworthy elements affecting the driving behavior of the ego car. A large concrete mixer truck is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the right side of the lane. This truck, marked by visible rear lights and reflective markings, demands careful attention due to its size and potential for unpredictable movements like sudden stops or maneuvers. This necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for possible delays.\n\nAdditionally, a sedan is positioned slightly ahead on the left side of the ego car's lane with its tail lights on. The sedan's proximity and movement could influence the ego car's decisions, especially if it changes lanes or slows down abruptly. Attention is required to manage the possibility of the sedan overtaking the truck and potentially impacting the ego car's lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are seen, thus no immediate actions concerning these users are needed. However, reflections or glare from lights on the windshield and streetlights along the road could impair the vision of the ego vehicle's sensors or the driver, necessitating slower speeds and increased focus."

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, is recognized by its cylindrical mixing drum and robust build. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road typically indicates it's on its way to a construction site or coming from one. Due to its size and operational purpose, such vehicles often move more slowly and make frequent stops. This necessitates increased awareness and caution from the driver of the ego car. The driver should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for sudden stops or turns by the construction vehicle, and possibly plan a lane change if safe and necessary to do so, to maintain a smooth traffic flow and ensure road safety.",

Monitor the sedan on the left for any signs of lane changing or speed adjustments. Reduce speed as appropriate for the wet road conditions to ensure adequate reaction times and stopping distances. Continue to observe the surroundings for any other road users or changes in traffic conditions that might emerge. The ego car should also be prepared to adjust speeds accordingly due to the large vehicle's potential slow movement and to avoid any dangers presented by the limited visibility due to the glare. Overtaking the truck should be done with caution, ensuring that the adjacent lane is clear."
