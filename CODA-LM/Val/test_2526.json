It directly influences the driving path of the ego car due to its size and occupation of the lane ahead. This vehicle is a potential hazard due to its size, position, and movement; it could reduce visibility for the ego vehicle and limit maneuverability, necessitating increased caution and a potential change in position or speed."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, the ego car is positioned behind a street cleaning vehicle which is directly in the same lane and facing the same direction. The street cleaner is brightly marked with yellow and green and equipped with brushes on its lower front. Due to its function, this vehicle likely travels slower than typical traffic and may make unexpected moves to clean the streets. Its presence requires the ego car to remain vigilant, as it might need to alter its course or speed to navigate around the cleaning vehicle safely.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, there is a traffic light showing a red signal. This mandates the ego car to stop at the intersection and wait until the signal turns green to continue. The ego car's immediate action is to hold position at the traffic stop until it is legal and secure to proceed.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, in an adjacent lane, there are other vehicles present. Those vehicles are important for the ego car to consider, as they could affect plans to turn or merge, depending on their distance and the ego car's intended movements."

            "description and explanation": "The image shows a maintenance or construction vehicle with high-visibility markings and is equipped with warning lights. Typically designed for use in roadworks or maintenance operations, this vehicle may indicate that there are ongoing construction activities nearby. Its presence on the road requires the ego car driver to be cautious and prepared to adjust speed or lane position in response to potential roadwork ahead. Due to the specialized nature of this vehicle, it may perform unexpected maneuvers or stop on the roadway, so maintaining a safe following distance and observing any posted signage about construction zones is essential for safe driving.",

The driver should monitor the street cleaning vehicle's brake lights and indicators for any signs of slowing down or intentions to perform maintenance tasks that might affect its path. Maintaining a vigilant observation of the surroundings is key in case the cleaning vehicle makes sudden turns or stops. Given the presence of the street cleaning vehicle directly ahead, the ego car should remain stationary behind this vehicle until either the light changes to green and the cleaning vehicle moves or there is an opportunity to change lanes safely if the lane to the right becomes clear if that is a legal and safe maneuver depending on the traffic situation. Additionally, the driver should monitor the street cleaning vehicle on the left, staying prepared to adjust the vehicle's position within the lane for safety and to allow the street cleaner to pass or to complete its maneuvers. Furthermore, the ego car should be prepared for the possibility that the street cleaning vehicle may come to a stop or change direction, thus maintaining a safe following distance is advisable."
