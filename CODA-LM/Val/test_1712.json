This truck's size and position directly affect the ego car's ability to navigate, influencing its speed and following distance. The truck also has visible dust and debris around its wheels, indicating recent movement, which limits maneuverability and visibility for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a red truck is observed overtaking a construction vehicle in the left lane, with a yellow car in the lane further to the left. These vehicles are moving in the same direction as the ego car, and their positions and speeds need to be monitored, especially if the ego car needs to change lanes.\n\nOverhead directional signs are present, indicating lane destinations and a speed limit of 50 km/h, with an additional 20 km/h noted for a specific lane. These signs provide critical information regarding speed regulations and lane usage that must be adhered to by the ego car.\n\nConcrete barriers are lining the median strip of the road, separating the directions of traffic. These barriers prevent the ego car from crossing over to oncoming traffic lanes and limit leftward maneuverability, directing the traffic flow and restricting the ego carâ€™s available driving strategies."

Adhere to the posted speed limit of 50 km/h and prepare to reduce speed to 20 km/h if the ego car's intended lane change requires it, as indicated by the overhead signs. Due to the size of the truck, be prepared for reduced visibility ahead and anticipate any potential hazards that may arise from blind spots or the truck's maneuvers. The ego car should also be aware of the red truck and the yellow car in the left lanes to avoid collision if a lane change becomes necessary. Continue monitoring for any changes in traffic signals and signs."
