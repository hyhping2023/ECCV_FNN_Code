        "description and explanation": "The scene observed in the traffic image includes several notable elements:\n\n1. **Vehicles**: There are several cars lined up at a fuel station, with the nearest being a black SUV that has its brake lights on, indicating that it is stationary. This lineup of vehicles needs to be considered to avoid unnecessary delays or potential hazards caused by congestion as the ego vehicle navigates the area.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**: A person is visible behind the fuel pump, seemingly refueling their car. The presence of this pedestrian requires the ego vehicle to maneuver carefully and remain prepared to stop if the person unexpectedly moves into the carâ€™s path.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**: A sign displaying fuel prices is visible within the gas station. Though informative about fuel prices, this sign does not impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle as it is not a regulatory traffic sign.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**: Yellow and black traffic cones and caution poles surround the gas pumps area, creating a boundary between the driving zone and the refueling zone. These cones indicate restricted vehicular access and ensure that the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the refueling area.\n\n5. **Barriers**: Yellow and black protective barriers are located near the gas pumps. These barriers demarcate safe driving areas from areas that should be avoided to prevent collisions with the pump infrastructure.\n\n6. **Other Objects**: Fire extinguishers and safety equipment are visible near the gas pumps along with a promotion sign. Although these objects do not directly impact driving behavior, they indicate the safety measures in place at the gas station."

Priority should be given to the pedestrian near the pump, ensuring their safety. The ego car should keep a safe distance from the traffic cones and barriers when driving through the station. Additionally, it should be prepared for sudden stops and starts from other vehicles leaving the pumps. Approach the gas station cautiously, be prepared to stop or yield to vehicles that may be leaving after refueling. Maintain a safe distance from the barriers to avoid any contact with the gas station infrastructure. Do not block other cars and select a pump that is becoming available or wait in the queue if all are occupied. Be vigilant for any pedestrians that might be around the vehicles or passing by the gas station."
