However, there is an object of interest located on the right side of the sidewalk, which is a trash can situated near the edge of the pedestrian crosswalk area. Although trash bins pose no direct danger to autonomous vehicles, their proximity to pedestrian crosswalks requires attention. This is because there is a potential for pedestrians to appear near or around these objects, which could affect the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle by necessitating caution and readiness to stop or slow down."

At the same time, pay attention to any traffic signs that may provide directions or restrictions for the road ahead. Maintain a safe driving speed and be prepared to stop at any time.

For the future driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of the waste bin does not directly influence driving decisions unless it obstructs the path of the vehicle, which in this case it does not. The driver should remain aware, however, that pedestrians may approach the bin to dispose of waste and should drive cautiously in areas with pedestrian activity.",
