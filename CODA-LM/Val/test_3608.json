Stay clear of the barriers and cones to the left which indicate potential roadworks or lane closures, adjusting the vehicle's position to the right if safe to do so. Continuously assess the white car's intentions and be ready to react to any quick lane changes or stops. Overall, maintain a low speed and high level of alertness in this complex traffic scenario. Additionally, adjustments for wet road conditions should be taken into account, and merging vehicles should be monitored closely. Given the possible construction indicated by the barriers and traffic cones, the ego car should also stay alert for any directional changes or obstacles that might suddenly appear."
