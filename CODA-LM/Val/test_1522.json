However, there is a vulnerable road user and a traffic light that are noteworthy.\n\nA cyclist is visible in the same lane as the ego vehicle, positioned ahead. The cyclist can be identified by their reflective clothing and the lights on their bicycle. Due to the cyclist's presence in the driving lane and their relatively slower speed, the ego vehicle must take precautionary measures. The appropriate response for the ego vehicle would be to either decelerate or to change lanes in order to overtake the cyclist safely, ensuring a secure distance is maintained at all times.\n\nAdditionally, there are green traffic lights observed in the distance at an intersection. The green signal indicates that the intersection is currently open for the ego vehicle to proceed through. While the ego vehicle should continue to advance, it is important to stay alert to both the potential for the traffic light to change and to the actions of the cyclist ahead. The ego vehicle must be prepared to adapt to these changes to maintain safety on the road."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is visible, typically used to indicate areas where traffic should not pass, or to mark construction or other roadside work. In a nighttime driving scenario, this cone would alert the driver of the ego vehicle to approach with caution, potentially indicating a hazard or requiring the driver to alter their path to avoid it. The reflective stripes on the cone enhance visibility, prompting drivers to slow down and be wary of potential changes in the road layout or the presence of workers. The positioning of the cone suggests a directive to either move over or be aware of activity happening adjacent to the driving path.",
