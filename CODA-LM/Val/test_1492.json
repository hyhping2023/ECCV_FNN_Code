        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements affecting the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. \n\nFirstly, there are two vehicles noted. One is a construction vehicle on the right side of our car, partially parked on the road and loaded with soil or rubble. This vehicle may obstruct the lane, leading to reduced lane width and potentially affecting traffic flow. The second vehicle is a green truck on the left side of the road, driving perpendicular to our vehicle. While it is another vehicle on the road, as long as it remains in its lane, it does not pose an immediate decision-making challenge.\n\nVulnerable road users identified include several pedestrians crossing at the zebra crossing on the right side of our car. Pedestrians have the right of way, necessitating that autonomous vehicles yield until they have safely crossed. Additionally, a motorcyclist is leading in the left lane, next to a forklift, moving in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle. Given their vulnerability, it is crucial for autonomous vehicles to maintain a safe following distance, be attentive to the motorcyclist's actions, and be prepared for sudden lane changes or stops.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a \"No Entry\" sign on the left indicates that the road to the left is inaccessible, limiting self-driving cars from entering the opposite lane at intersections.\n\nThe traffic lights observed show that the light ahead is red for going straight but green for turning right. This means vehicles intending to go straight must stop, while those turning right can proceed when the lanes are clear and it is safe.\n\nLastly, other objects in the scene include construction signs and barriers on the right side of the road, signaling a construction area. This suggests that traffic patterns may change suddenly or unexpected obstacles may arise, requiring vigilance and adaptability from the autonomous vehicle. \n\nNo traffic cones or barriers were noted in this image, indicating their absence from the scene."
