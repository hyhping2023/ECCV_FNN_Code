A white SUV ahead on the right, moving in the same direction. Its position dictates that the ego vehicle maintain a safe following distance.\n3. Several cars in front with brake lights on, indicating slow or stopped traffic ahead. This suggests a traffic congestion or bottleneck that would require the ego car to slow down and be prepared to stop.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A motorcyclist to the left of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. Motorcyclists are less visible and more vulnerable, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a cautious distance.\n2. A cyclist in a yellow jacket on the right edge of the road, moving in the same direction as traffic. Cyclists are vulnerable and might swerve to avoid road hazards; the ego car should pass with care and maintain a safe distance.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. A 'No Parking' sign on the right side of the road. This indicates that vehicles should not be parked along the roadside, affecting road availability for driving or pulling over if necessary.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. Traffic cones and barriers positioned around debris or an obstruction on the right side of the road. These indicate a potential hazard area that the ego vehicle must navigate around, possibly by changing lanes if it's safe to do so.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Yellow and black barriers on the right, blocking access to a specific part of the road due to an obstruction or work zone. They indicate that the vehicle must remain in the current lane and cannot merge right.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n1. A dustbin and other miscellaneous items spilled onto the road on the right side. This presents an unpredictable hazard that might cause other vehicles to swerve or stop abruptly."
