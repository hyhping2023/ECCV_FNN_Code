The first category, vehicles, includes at least one indistinct presence that is difficult to accurately identify due to poor lighting conditions and distance. The potential presence of such vehicles necessitates cautious driving, with particular attention to any signs of lights or movement that could reveal their positions.\n\nThe second category consists of traffic cones. There is a series of cones placed on the right side of the road, featuring reflective orange and white stripes. These cones typically signify that there could be road work, an obstruction, or an area of the road that is not safe to drive on, indicating that drivers will need to alter their route or lane position in response to this obstruction.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are reported in the provided data."

The presence of a traffic cone on the road suggests that there may be a temporary change in driving conditions ahead.

The vehicle's headlights should be properly adjusted to improve visibility, and the driver should remain attentive for any sudden changes in the road or unexpected hazards. If the ego car is equipped with automatic light adjustment or night vision capabilities, it should utilize these features to enhance safety. Additionally, the car should be actively scanning for any road signs, traffic lights, or additional hazards that may be difficult to see in the darkness."
