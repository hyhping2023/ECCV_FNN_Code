Directly ahead, the road is occupied by multiple vehicles, including a yellow construction vehicle, a sedan, and others in the distance, all moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car will need to adjust its speed accordingly and maintain a safe following distance. On the right side, a heavy vehicle or crane truck is partially on the road and stationary, necessitating the ego car to keep a safe distance to avoid potential hazards. Additionally, there are several cars in the opposite lane moving away from the ego car, which are not an immediate threat but should be watched for sudden turns or stops. An oncoming vehicle is also present in the left-most lane traveling in the opposite direction, which should be monitored for any unexpected lane changes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, overhead directional signs are visible spanning across the roadway in the distance, providing routing information but not immediately affecting driving behavior. Road signs are also present on the right side of the road, past the construction vehicle, which may indicate road conditions or construction work ahead.\n\nThe traffic lights are visible in the distance, but their status is indeterminate from the image. The ego vehicle will need to be ready to respond to the traffic lights as it gets closer.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed in the middle of the road, indicating lane separation or road work, and the ego car must navigate within the boundaries they mark.\n\nFor barriers, there are green and white metal barriers along the median, separating the traffic moving in opposite directions and guiding the car to maintain the correct lane to prevent head-on collisions. Metal guardrails are also present on the right side of the road past the heavy vehicle, marking the edge of the roadway and any road shoulder restrictions.\n\nNo other objects are reported in the image."

Adhere to lane markings and be aware of the traffic cones dividing traffic. Stay in the current lane unless a lane change is necessary for a destination, and monitor the commercial vehicle on the left for any movement into traffic. Proceed with regular caution and remain vigilant for any instructions from overhead signs or changes in road conditions ahead. Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared for possible lane closures or shifts due to road work. Observe the road signs for additional information on road conditions or works. Do not attempt to overtake the construction vehicle before confirming it is safe to do so and stay in the current lane due to the median barriers. Prepare to adjust speed based on the flow of traffic and the upcoming traffic light, and consider changing to the left lane safely to avoid the construction vehicle obstruction in the right lane. Stay vigilant for any changes in road conditions or traffic signs as the situation ahead becomes clearer."
