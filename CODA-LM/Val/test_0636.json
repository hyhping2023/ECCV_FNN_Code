Its presence in the adjacent lane also warrants attention for potential lane changes.\n- A white sedan driving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction.

Its rugged and durable design is equipped to handle the stresses of construction sites and the transport of heavy or irregular loads. This vehicle typically moves at a slower pace when laden with heavy materials, which may influence the flow of traffic around it. Other drivers, including the ego car, may need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the possibility of this vehicle making wide turns, frequent stops, or moving at varying speeds due to its load and destination within a construction area.",

Be prepared to change lanes if the truck's load presents a hazard or if the truck performs any unexpected maneuvers. Monitor the truck's indicators for intentions to turn or change lanes. Keep the white sedan in the lane-clear zone within sight to avoid any sudden braking it might undertake. Continue to obey the green traffic light while being alert for it changing to yellow. Drive at a speed appropriate for the road conditions and traffic situation."
