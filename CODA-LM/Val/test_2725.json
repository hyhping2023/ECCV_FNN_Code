The truck is situated in the right lane but is positioned diagonally, extending from the right lane into the edge of the left lane with its mixer protruding into the left lane. This positioning of the truck could potentially create a hazardous situation for the ego car, especially if it tries to overtake the truck by passing in the left lane, due to encroachment into that lane by the truck's mixer."

Its presence suggests ongoing construction or maintenance work in the area. The ego car must be cautious and prepared for potential obstacles, reduced speed limits, or detours.

If the left lane is not safe or legal to use for overtaking, the ego car should wait behind the truck until the truck moves back into its lane or until a safe opportunity to pass arises."
