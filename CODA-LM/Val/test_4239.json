        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are multiple vehicles and barriers present. Specifically, a yellow taxi is directly in front of our car, positioned in the center of the lane with adequate space between the two vehicles. This situation requires our vehicle to be prepared to adjust speed or come to a stop if the taxi slows down or stops. Additionally, a large blue truck, resembling a crane, is in the right-hand lane, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Due to its size and potential for wide turns or sudden movements, caution is necessary when proceeding alongside this truck.\n\nRegarding barriers, there is a green median strip on the right, separating the lane from the sidewalk. This barrier emphasizes lane boundaries and alerts drivers to the possibility of pedestrians crossing at designated points. Moreover, a metal fence is installed on the central divider to separate traffic moving in opposite directions, enforcing the direction of traffic flow and prohibiting any crossing or overtaking maneuvers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the yellow taxi ahead, always be prepared to decelerate or stop. Pay attention to the blue truck on the right, as its size and potential maneuvers could affect the surrounding traffic flow. Stay within the marked lanes, watch out for the metal guardrails on the ground, which mark the edge of the driving lane. Currently, there are no signals or indications that directly impact our vehicle's behavior, so general road rules should be adhered to and vigilance maintained.",

Due to its dimensions, the ego car must maintain a safe distance to ensure visibility and reaction time in case the construction vehicle makes sudden stops or turns. The ego car should also be aware that such vehicles often make wide turns and may require additional space when maneuvering.",
