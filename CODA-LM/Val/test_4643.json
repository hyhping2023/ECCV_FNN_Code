These cars necessitate observation to ensure safe lane usage and to be prepared for possible lane changes by the ego car or other vehicles.\n\nOn the right side sidewalk, there are pedestrians walking. These individuals could present a risk as there's a chance they might step onto the road unexpectedly. Behind the van, cyclists are noted near the sidewalk, creating a situation where the ego car needs to be ready to respond if they attempt to move onto the road.\n\nAn overhead directional traffic sign is present, displaying road names and directions, which could be crucial for navigational decisions, especially if the ego car needs to change lanes to follow a certain route.\n\nFinally, there are flower planters in the road's median, which effectively divide the traffic flowing in opposite directions and serve as a reminder that any overtaking or turning maneuvers must be conducted at specific locations."
