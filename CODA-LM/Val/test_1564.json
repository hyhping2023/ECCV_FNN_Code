On the right side of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead and traveling in the same direction, there is a gray car. This vehicle demands attention from the autonomous system since it may change lanes or reduce speed, presenting a potential hazard to the ego vehicle.\n\nAhead, there are multiple vehicles in the lanes the ego car is following, all moving in the same direction. The driving behavior of the ego car will be affected by these vehicles as it needs to adapt speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, in the lanes opposite, there are numerous vehicles moving in a direction contrary to the ego car. These vehicles are also a concern as there is a risk that one might swerve or turn unexpectedly into the path of the ego car.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist ahead on the right, pedaling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The autonomous system operating the ego vehicle must ensure a safe distance from the cyclist and may need to consider changing lanes to overtake, all while prioritizing the cyclist's safety.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene display a red signal for the lanes going straight, including the lane of the ego vehicle, and a green arrow for left turns. Consequently, the ego vehicle must be ready to come to a complete stop at the intersection.\n\nLastly, an observation of a bus shelter on the right side of the road near the lane where the cyclist is traveling suggests potential pedestrian activity. The ego vehicle should remain alert for pedestrians, particularly if there are buses arriving at or departing from the shelter."

It is typically colored in highly-visible hues like orange, with reflective striping to ensure it is easily seen by drivers. In this context, the presence of a traffic cone on the road usually indicates that drivers should be alert to hazards or changes in driving conditions, such as road construction, an accident, or other disruptions.

The presence of a traffic cone in a driving environment suggests that there may be road work, obstacles, or hazards ahead.
