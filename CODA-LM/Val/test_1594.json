It is distinguishable by its higher profile and emergency lighting, indicating a potential road obstruction or a scene of interest for emergency services. This necessitates caution and possibly changing lanes.\n\nSeveral cars are in the same lane as the ego car, with a sedan directly in front. The sedan's brake lights suggest it is either slowing down or stopped, indicating traffic congestion or an active traffic disruption ahead.\n\nAdditionally, several vehicles are in the right lane, moving at a slower pace as inferred from their visible brake lights. This slowed traffic indicates possible congestion or reaction to the incident, which affects the ego car's potential lane change to the right.\n\nTraffic cones are placed between the left and right lanes, creating a narrowed path and a potential obstacle course. This arrangement reduces the available road width and indicates a need for careful navigation, possibly due to a road incident or construction.\n\nLastly, permanent lane barriers are present along the edge of the rightmost lane. These barriers suggest a predetermined road layout that must be followed, which may include lane reductions or shifts."

Prepare to stop or change lanes if necessary, observing the road for any signals from the emergency vehicle or instructions from road workers. Caution should be used when passing the emergency scene to avoid hazards and respect the work being done. Due to the wet road conditions, be prepared to stop or slow down further due to the car immediately in front, watch for any changes in the behavior of the truck with emergency lights, and be ready to merge left if the lane narrows excessively due to the cones."
