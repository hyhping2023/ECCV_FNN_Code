This vehicle could obstruct the path since it appears to be involved in loading or unloading operations.\n\nThe presence of a group of pedestrians, including children crossing the street ahead, requires the ego car to yield to allow for their safe crossing. Additionally, there is a rider on a yellow motorized scooter moving across the intersection, requiring the ego car to be vigilant to avoid a potential collision. Cyclists are also noted on the right side of the ego car, sharing the road and necessitating cautious driving to prevent accidents.\n\nAn individual is standing by a stationary two-wheeled scooter close to the ego car's driving lane on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle must monitor this person carefully for any indications that they may enter the road.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a directional sign above indicating the lanes for going straight ahead and making a right turn, guiding the ego car to stay in the correct lane for its intended route. Also present is a no parking sign on the right side of the road, highlighting areas where stopping or slowing down is not permitted.\n\nThe traffic light arrangement includes a red light for lanes going straight and a green arrow for the turn lane, meaning the ego car must stop if traveling straight or proceed with caution if turning.\n\nConcrete and metal barriers are set up to separate the pedestrian area from the road on the right, requiring the ego car to maintain its position within the designated lanes and avoid crossing into the protected zones.\n\nOther objects in the scene include various motor scooters parked along the right side of the road. These scooters narrow the available road space and may lead to pedestrians stepping further into the road as they go around them.\n\nNo traffic cones are mentioned in the scene. Overall, the ego vehicle must navigate carefully considering these road users and traffic elements to maintain safety and abide by road regulations."
