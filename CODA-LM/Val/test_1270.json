This parked truck narrows the available lanes for traffic, requiring drivers to maneuver around it.\n- A yellow municipal service vehicle is partially in the rightmost lane with its rear facing the ego car, marked with reflective material and surrounded by orange traffic cones. This vehicle indicates obstruction in the rightmost lane, necessitating a lane change or reduced speed.\n- A white car is traveling in the same direction as the ego car, positioned in the center lane a moderate distance ahead. While it doesn't pose an immediate obstacle, its presence and behavior should be monitored for maintaining a safe following distance.\n- A white van is stationary on the right edge of the road towards the foreground of the image. Although it is not obstructing the ego car's lane, its position may require attention as it could potentially enter the road or signify activity on the right side.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:** \n- A motorcyclist is seen in the far distance ahead of the ego car, located on the left side of the rightmost lane. This motorcyclist is vulnerable due to their size and exposure, requiring heightened awareness and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary.\n\n**Traffic Cones:** \n- Orange traffic cones are placed to the right of the ego car, starting from the yellow service vehicle and extending beyond it. These cones demarcate a work zone or an area where vehicular access is restricted, thereby instructing drivers to merge left.\n\nThere are no notable traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in the image."
