However, there is a medium-sized, light-colored dog standing close to the edge of the driving lane on the right side of the road, facing the camera. The presence of the dog near the roadway is a potential hazard as it may enter the traffic lane, which could lead to an accident or require sudden maneuvers to avoid a collision. Additionally, there is a traffic sign on the left side of the road. This sign is a vertical rectangular blue sign with white text and symbols, mounted on a pole. Although the specific message of the sign is unclear from the image, it appears to be providing information or direction. However, its message does not immediately affect the driving behavior in the current context."
