A dark-colored sedan is parked on the right side of the road, facing the opposite direction, which warrants caution as it may obscure pedestrians or unexpectedly enter traffic. Additionally, there are several cars parked along the right side of the street; they are not blocking the primary lane but do narrow the available driving space and suggest potential pedestrian activity around these vehicles. \n\nIn terms of traffic control, a traffic light ahead is displaying green, indicating it's safe to proceed. However, the driver should still remain alert to changing signals and any possible intersecting traffic as they approach the intersection.\n\nLastly, there are piles of garbage bins and trash by the roadside near the parked sedan. This could pose a hazard as the bins may obstruct the driver's view and could be a potential risk if they were to be blown onto the roadway. Drivers must remain vigilant for such obstacles.\n\nVulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in the current image and hence are not considered in the driving behavior context for this situation."

If not already activated, turn on the headlights and windshield wipers to improve visibility.",
