The size and nature of the truck, especially with a potentially rotating cement mixer, can pose risks due to its wide turns, blind spots, and the possibility of debris falling off. The truck's size and load might affect its braking distance and maneuverability. It limits the ego vehicle's visibility ahead and requires increased following distance."

Monitor the behavior of vehicles in adjacent lanes for any signs of lane switching or erratic movement. Be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary while maintaining lane discipline. Maintain a safe following distance from the heavy truck ahead, accounting for its size and the potential hazards it could present. Be prepared for any debris that may fall from the truck's mixer. Keep an eye on the cars in the adjacent lanes, especially for any indicators that they might be attempting to change lanes. Do not attempt to overtake the heavy truck without a clear and safe opportunity to do so. Continue monitoring the road conditions, traffic behavior, and maintain a defensive driving posture to react to any unforeseen circumstances. Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck, given its size and potential for slower maneuvers. Be aware of the vehicles in the adjacent lanes and be prepared for possible lane changes into your lane. Monitor the flow of traffic to anticipate any stoppages or changes in speed. Since there are no visible traffic lights or signs, follow standard road rules and the behavior of surrounding traffic to guide driving actions."
