This requires vehicles to merge left earlier to avoid the truck. There are no visible traffic signs that affect the immediate driving behavior of the ego car, so standard road rules apply. A traffic light is showing a red signal, indicating that the ego car must stop and cannot proceed until the signal changes to green. Multiple traffic cones are positioned to the right of the ego car, behind the cement mixer truck, indicating a construction zone or detour path. These cones highlight the boundaries of the construction zone and guide traffic away from it, requiring attention and possible lane changes. There are no visible barriers affecting the ego car's driving behavior, and there are no other objects that impact the scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This image depicts a large vehicle with features characteristic of those used in construction settings. The vehicle's build suggests it contains a cement mixer, indicated by the rotating drum on the back, typically used for mixing and transporting concrete. For the ego vehicle, or the driver's perspective from which the photo was taken, this construction vehicle's presence may necessitate increased caution and potentially a change in driving behavior. The ego vehicle might need to maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for the construction vehicle's slower movement, and be vigilant for possible stopping or turning movements of the construction vehicle. Additionally, if the construction vehicle is part of an active work zone, the ego vehicle should watch for signage indicating detours or shifts in traffic patterns.",

It should maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck and be prepared to merge left if necessary when the traffic light turns green and if the rightmost lane remains obstructed. The driver should also pay attention to the traffic cones indicating the construction zone for potential redirection or lane closure ahead. Additionally, due to the wet road conditions, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, slow down, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary, while being aware of the narrowed lane space and ensuring it's safe to merge into adjacent lanes."
