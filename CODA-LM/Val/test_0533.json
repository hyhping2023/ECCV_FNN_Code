The first is a large vehicle, directly ahead of the ego car, characterized by orange clearance lights on its rear and reflective markings. This indicates that it is likely a truck or similar heavy vehicle. Its position in the same lane as the ego car means that it will set the travel speed for the ego car, which must maintain a safe distance and be ready to adapt to any changes such as speed adjustments or lane changes initiated by the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is another vehicle to the left, identifiable by its blue and red flashing lights, which is likely to be an emergency vehicle. The presence of this vehicle could signal an incident ahead, implying that there might be road obstructions or unexpected behavior from surrounding traffic. It might also necessitate the ego car to yield, depending on the situation on the road."
