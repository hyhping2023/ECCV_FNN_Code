Firstly, a red forklift is positioned on the left side of the ego car, within the same lane and in close proximity. The forklift is facing and moving in the same direction as the ego car. Due to the forklift's proximity and the potential speed difference, the ego car may need to slow down, change lanes, or overtake to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a car ahead in the ego car's lane, also traveling in the same direction. The car's movements are part of the traffic flow and will influence the ego car's decisions regarding speed and lane-keeping.\n\nA cyclist is also present ahead of the ego car, traveling in the same direction on the right side of the same lane. The presence of the cyclist means the ego car must be prepared to either slow down or change lanes to overtake the cyclist safely, maintaining a safe distance at all times.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is showing green, which indicates that the ego car and other vehicles in the same lane have the right of way to proceed.\n\nLastly, there are green fabric barriers erected on both sides of the road. These barriers suggest that there may be construction or that certain areas are partitioned off. As a result, the ego car should proceed with caution due to the potential changes in traffic patterns and the presence of construction zones."

It should prepare to overtake the forklift by switching lanes if it is safe to do so, ensuring not to encroach on the cyclist's space. Furthermore, the ego car should keep a safe distance from the cyclist and overtake only when it is safe and permissible by the lane markings. The green traffic light indicates that the ego car can continue, but attention must be given to the possibility of slowing down if the forklift or cyclist impacts the flow of traffic. Maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, prepare to overtake the cyclist with ample space while being cautious of the forklift on the left, and continue straight while the traffic light is green. Adjust the vehicle's position slightly to the right if necessary to maintain distance from the barriers on the left. Stay alert for any changes in the traffic light or unexpected movements from the forklift or the cyclist."
