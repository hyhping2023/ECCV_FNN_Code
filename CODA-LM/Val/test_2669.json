The truck's bright rear and hazard lights are visible. The size and position of the truck, along with its potential slow movement, may affect the ego vehicle's speed and lane choice, possibly requiring a lane change or speed adjustment.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan is partially visible on the left side, positioned in an adjacent lane and overtaking the ego vehicle. The sedan's presence and movement could impact the ego vehicle's ability to safely change lanes to the left.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects affecting the driving behavior in the immediate vicinity.\n\nAlthough no traffic signs are visible that would affect immediate driving behavior, the absence of such signs indicates that standard road rules apply. The ego vehicle should remain prepared to respond to dynamic changes in the environment.\n\nA traffic light is visible atop the truck, displaying a red light towards the ego vehicle, signaling that the ego vehicle must stop. This could indicate that the ego vehicle is at an intersection or that the red light is attached to the truck for a mobile work zone, requiring caution and readiness to stop.\n\nLastly, a barrier is present to the right, marking the boundary of the road's right edge and a construction or closed area. This barrier limits the available lanes for the ego vehicle, preventing any rightward lane changes."

Overtaking may be risky due to the adjacent white sedan in the left lane. It may be beneficial to slow down and follow the truck at a safe distance until the situation ahead is clear, and it's safe to pass or the light turns green. If the red light is related to the truck and not a fixed traffic light at an intersection, the ego vehicle should maintain caution for potential work zone activities and follow any applicable regulations or instructions from the truck's signaling devices and signs."
