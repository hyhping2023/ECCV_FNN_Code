        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are vehicles parked on both sides of the road. Notably, the vehicles on this side are parked in a manner that narrows the driving lane, which limits the space available for driving and necessitates careful maneuvering to avoid side scraping. Additionally, there is a large black obstacle placed at the corner of the road, blocking the crosswalk and part of the right-hand lane. This obstacle likely indicates a construction area or a region to be avoided, which means that usual traffic routes will need to be altered. On the sidewalk to the right, there are gray public benches, with one bench positioned closer to the driving lane. While these benches do not directly impede the driving route, it is important to remain vigilant for any pedestrians that may be in the vicinity."

    "driving_suggestion": "In the current driving scenario, the vehicle should maintain a moderate speed and stay alert. It might be necessary to merge right to avoid a yellow van and to accommodate the narrowing of the road due to parked vehicles. The driver must also be vigilant for indications or lane changes caused by traffic cones and obstacles, and adjust driving behavior according to the wet road conditions. Cautious driving is advised to prepare for unanticipated obstacles or changes in traffic patterns. Regularly monitor the red tricycle in intersections for any changes that might affect the flow of traffic. Due to parked cars and obstacles, the width of the driving lane is reduced, which may also require slight adjustments to the driving path. Since there are no traffic lights in the picture, the vehicle should follow standard intersection traffic rules, yield when necessary, and proceed when it is safe to do so. Always be prepared to deal with unexpected obstacles or roadway users that may be hidden by parked vehicles or other structures.",
