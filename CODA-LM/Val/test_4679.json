These signs could provide important information such as speed limits or directions that the ego car needs to follow.\n\nA traffic light ahead is displaying a green light, permitting the ego car to proceed through the intersection if conditions are safe.\n\nTraffic cones are visible in the bottom center of the image, partially obstructing the ego car's lane. These cones indicate a potential hazard or road work, requiring the ego car to either change lanes or carefully navigate around them if the lane width allows.\n\nBarriers are present on the left side of the road, likely indicating a construction zone.

Additionally, the ego car should reduce speed and exercise caution due to the wet road conditions to ensure safe stopping distances and overall vehicle control, and be ready to adapt to movements of all observed vehicles. Watch for any posted road signs as they become clearer."
