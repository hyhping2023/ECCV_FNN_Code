On the left, there is a blue dump truck diagonally crossing the opposing lane and partially entering our lane, which poses a risk of collision. A white bus is parked on the right side and is stationary, which does not presently block the traffic but requires attention for any sudden movements or associated pedestrians. A large yellow bulldozer is also present to the right, parallel to our lane and may potentially enter the road, necessitating close monitoring of its activity.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white sedan parked on the left side, perpendicular to our lane, which could be preparing to enter or cross the main road, potentially affecting traffic flow. Further down the road, there are several vehicles in the distance that may influence traffic conditions, requiring adjustments in speed or lane changes to maintain a smooth traffic flow.\n\nLastly, there is a single vulnerable road user to be aware of: a pedestrian who is starting to cross from the left side, heading towards the right. It is essential to be prepared to slow down or stop to ensure the pedestrian's safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scenario that need to be considered in the driving decision-making process."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the uncertain road conditions and the presence of pedestrians, please reduce your speed and be prepared to stop safely for pedestrians crossing the street. Keep an eye on the blue dump truck and the white sedan to prevent them from suddenly changing lanes into your lane. Carefully pass parked buses and bulldozers. Stay alert for any road users or obstacles that may appear in your blind spots. This vehicle should also maintain a safe distance from the blue engineering truck and keep a close watch on it, in case it suddenly brakes or turns. Moreover, be cautious around the parked white sedan and the yellow loader, in case they suddenly move, and pay close attention to oncoming buses and other traffic ahead.",
