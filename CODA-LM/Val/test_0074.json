A blue bus on the left side of the road, facing towards the camera. This bus can either stop to pick up passengers or start to move, potentially cutting into the ego car's lane.\n2. A white car immediately in front of the ego car, facing away and in the same direction. This vehicle may slow down, stop, or change lanes, requiring the ego car to adjust its speed and follow at a safe distance.\n3. Various cars in front of the ego car, either stopped or moving slowly in traffic. These vehicles dictate the speed of traffic and any potential lane changes for the ego car.\n\nThere are two vulnerable road users:\n1. A group of pedestrians on the right side of the road, with some crossing the street. Pedestrians could step into traffic lanes, forcing vehicles including the ego car to stop or slow down to avoid an accident.\n2. A cyclist on the right edge of the ego car's lane, moving in the same direction. The cyclist's presence necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and the ego car needs to be prepared to move over to provide sufficient space when overtaking.\n\nOne traffic sign is noted:\n- A no-entry sign on the right side of the road, indicating the road is not for through traffic. This sign directs traffic to follow the marked lanes, preventing the ego car from entering that road and thus guiding its driving path choice.\n\nThere are multiple orange traffic cones:\n- These cones are placed in the ego car's lane, forming a taper to guide traffic away from the right side of the road. The cones indicate a restricted area ahead, such as lane narrowing or lane closure, which the ego car must navigate around.\n\nLastly, there are no barriers, and the category of other objects includes:\n- A note that there is no identifiable debris or other hazardous objects in the ego vehicleâ€™s immediate driving path. This clear path allows for normal driving without the need for evasive maneuvers."
