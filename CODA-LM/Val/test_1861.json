This stationary vehicle could present obstacles for visibility or potentially start moving, which would require monitoring by the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a large animal, which appears to be a dog, is in the middle of the ego vehicle's lane, moving across the road from left to right. The presence of the animal on the road poses a direct risk of collision and necessitates immediate action from the ego vehicle to avoid an accident.\n\nThere is also a road sign on the right side of the road, which might be indicating directions or providing information about upcoming roads. Although the sign may contain important navigational information, it does not immediately affect the vehicle's driving behavior.\n\nLastly, debris is visible on the right side of the road, not in the direct path of the ego car. The debris is not an immediate threat, but it suggests that caution should be exercised in case of further unexpected obstacles on the road.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A tricycle is a vehicle with three wheels, which can vary in size from smaller versions pushed by a child to larger, motorized varieties operated by an adult. Tricycles are typically slower and wider than bicycles, requiring extra caution from the ego car to ensure safe passing distance. If motorized, the tricycle may occupy the road like any other vehicle, thereby dictating a potential change in the ego car's path or speed to accommodate safe sharing of the road.",

Additionally, the ego vehicle should perform checks to make sure it's safe to potentially change lanes, should the animal not move out of the path. The parked white van should be monitored in the event it starts moving but does not require immediate action other than ensuring a safe distance is maintained."
