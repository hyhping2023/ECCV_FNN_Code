A heavy truck occupies the opposite lane and is heading towards our vehicle. Due to its large size and close proximity, especially when both vehicles are in motion, the risk of collision is significantly high.\n2. A large beige truck with its cargo hold filled with soil or a similar substance is located ahead in the same lane, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The truck's size and the possibility of debris falling onto the road pose potential risks that could obstruct visibility or cause damage to our vehicle.\n3. Through a gap between the beige truck and the wall on the right, a green truck is partially visible, seemingly parked or moving very slowly. This could block the lane that our vehicle might use to overtake the beige truck.\n\nNext, there is a traffic sign:\n- On the road to the right, there is a speed limit sign displaying \"5,\" accompanied by Chinese text describing the speed limit in the area. It indicates the need to maintain a low speed while driving, as there could be a construction area ahead.\n\nFinally, there is a barrier:\n- A concrete or stone wall runs parallel to the road on the right side, limiting the operating space. This reduction in available road width could be crucial when considering overtaking or avoiding hazards.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are noted in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Adhere to the speed limit signs by driving at a lower speed, be prepared to stop at any time in case the truck ahead poses a direct danger, and maintain a safe distance from oncoming heavy trucks. Due to the narrow roads and potential oncoming traffic, avoid overtaking. Drive cautiously around scattered gravel on the road to prevent tire damage or loss of control. Keep a safe following distance from the beige truck ahead so there is time to respond to possible debris falling or sudden stopping. Drive carefully since wet or dirty road conditions can affect tire traction and vehicle control. Continue to pay attention to additional signs or changes in traffic patterns ahead. As the dump truck on the left partially obstructs the view, the vehicle should immediately slow down to comply with the speed limit and ensure there is enough reaction time. The driver should be ready to stop or take evasive action to avoid potential collisions and pay attention to any signals from truck drivers about their intentions.",
