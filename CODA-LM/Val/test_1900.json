Drivers must be cautious at night, ensuring that their lane position is correct to avoid being blinded by the glare and to safely pass the oncoming vehicle with ample space.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are present on the right side of the road, signaling the beginning of a construction zone or a road narrowing. These cones serve as a guide for autonomous vehicles to slow down and exercise increased caution while navigating the area.\n\nThere are metal guardrails and obstacles along both sides of the road, indicating that there are limited options for evasive maneuvers and emphasizing the importance of maintaining a precise driving path within the lane, especially given the reduced visibility.\n\nThe overall dim lighting on the road, along with potential reflections, suggests a decrease in visibility. This condition calls for heightened alertness, slowed speeds, and preparedness for unseen hazards that might be difficult to detect under low visibility conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the red light ahead, the vehicle should prepare to stop if it has not already done so. Slow down also due to slippery road conditions. Be mindful of any movement signs or pedestrians, and be ready to respond should the situation change. The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from oncoming traffic and be prepared to navigate through the marked construction area or the lane narrowing section indicated by traffic cones. Use the headlights appropriately to ensure visibility and to avoid dazzling oncoming vehicles. Moreover, the vehicle should closely monitor any other road users or obstacles that may emerge from the dark surroundings.",
