Starting with vehicles, there is a white car positioned in the left lane, moving in the same direction as our autonomous vehicle. Our vehicle needs to keep an eye on this white car to maintain a safe following distance and monitor any changes in its speed. Additionally, a green car is visible ahead, but in the right lane. Our vehicle should adjust its own speed to ensure a safe gap between them and be prepared for any potential maneuvers that the green car might make, such as stopping or changing lanes.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there is a green sign situated above, on the right side of the road, providing directions for the lanes and indicating an approaching exit. This sign assists our vehicle in making timely and safe lane changes if it intends to take the exit.\n\nRegarding traffic control devices, there are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the lane, which create a makeshift barrier. These cones signal that the lane is partially closed, necessitating that our vehicle merges left to continue safely around the obstruction.\n\nThere is also a green hedge running alongside the sidewalk on the right side of the road. This hedge acts as a physical barrier, reducing the risk of pedestrians inadvertently entering the roadway.\n\nThe JSON data did not specify any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image, so it can be inferred that these elements are not factors in the current driving situation."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the blue car in the same lane and be prepared to change lanes to the left due to traffic cones on the right lane. It should also remain vigilant of the traffic conditions ahead, ready to adjust speed or route according to the actions of other drivers. Additionally, the driver should read the green overhead signs in advance to be prepared for a lane change if necessary. Keep to the current lane while maintaining a safe distance from the green car ahead. Observe the speed of the white car to adjust the following distance. Due to traffic reasons, avoid moving to the right lane and stay alert to any changes in road construction marked by traffic cones. Be prepared to slow down if there are changes in the roadwork ahead. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle directly in front, be cautious of vehicles on the right, and anticipate potential merging due to lane closures indicated by traffic cones. Do not switch to the left lane until it is confirmed safe, and be aware of any vehicles that may merge into your lane from the left. Continue following the signs to reach your destination.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is generally used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents. In the provided image, the traffic cone is alerting drivers to potential hazards or changes in the driving path ahead. The ego car should proceed with caution, potentially altering its trajectory or speed to safely navigate past the traffic cone while being cognizant of the modified traffic patterns it may indicate.",
