    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance behind the cement mixer truck, monitor its speed, and be prepared to deal with its potential slow-moving. Choose the appropriate lane based on the predetermined route: if continuing on the highway, avoid using the right lane to prevent unintentional exits; if planning to exit, be ready to safely switch to the right lane. Be aware of the sedan parked on the left, and be prepared for it to re-enter the flow of traffic. Stay vigilant while driving in the lane close to the median strip to avoid side collisions or crashes. Proceed with caution when overtaking the concrete mixer truck, ensuring there is sufficient visibility and space to pass safely. Drive carefully due to the truck's skewed position and the possibility of orange barriers indicating roadwork ahead.",
