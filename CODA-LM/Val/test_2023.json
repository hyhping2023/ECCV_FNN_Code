The direction in which they are placed suggests that the vehicle needs to either stop or redirect its path to avoid the cordoned-off area.

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the presence of specific road management tools such as traffic cones and barriers plays a pivotal role in guiding the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, or the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there's a sequence of orange traffic cones, noticeable for their reflective stripes. These are strategically placed in a diagonal alignment across the car's projected path, extending from the lower right to the center-left region of the visible area. The arrangement of these cones in a staggered pattern distinctly signals a lane or an area closure. The purpose of this setup is to alert the vehicle of an imminent road closure or construction activities ahead. Their orientation and placement are critical, directing the vehicle to either halt or significantly alter its course to circumvent the restricted zone. This arrangement serves as a clear indication that part of the road or area is temporarily inaccessible, primarily due to roadworks or other obstructions that the car should avoid entering.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, there are rectangular barriers equipped with reflective materials. These barriers are effectively used to delineate a boundary, explicitly blocking any access to the area lying beyond them. Positioned on the left side of the road and extending beyond the traffic cones, they signify an additional layer of restriction, possibly denoting a zone under construction or maintenance. The strategic location and the role of these barriers are crucial. They act as a visual deterrent, compelling the vehicle to refrain from advancing into the restricted space, thereby preempting potential hazards or entry into unauthorized zones. Moreover, the presence of these barriers emphasizes the need for the vehicle to adhere to the right side of the road, reinforcing the prohibition against traversing the left area which is off-limits.\n\nThe detailed organization and the functional significance of both the traffic cones and barriers in this traffic scenario underscore their importance in safely directing the autonomous vehicle away from potential hazards and maintaining the flow within permissible areas."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a brightly colored cone used on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It usually signifies the presence of construction, an accident ahead, or other road changes or obstructions. The driving behavior of the ego car should be influenced in such a way that the driver should remain alert, reduce speed, and possibly change lanes if necessary to avoid the area marked by the cones, being prepared for potential hazards or changes in the normal traffic pattern. The driver must observe for any directions given via signage or road workers in the vicinity.",

It must assess whether there is an alternative route provided, such as a bypass for the closed lane or area ahead. If the way is clearly marked as closed with no alternative passage, the vehicle should come to a stop and wait for instructions or seek an alternate route using a different road. With the low ambient light conditions, the ego car's headlights and sensors should be utilized to maintain clear visibility. Proceed with caution, being mindful of any temporary traffic directions or additional road users that may be obscured by the barriers or environmental conditions."
