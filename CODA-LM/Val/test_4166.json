The first vehicle is a green bus on the left, facing the ego vehicle with its headlights on, and it appears to be either stationary or moving slowly at an intersection. The presence of this bus is significant for the ego vehicle's driving behavior, as the ego vehicle may need to wait for the bus to move across the intersection or remain stopped, depending on the traffic signals or the bus's right of way.\n\nThe second vehicle is a blue and yellow bus on the right, with its side visible to the ego vehicle. It is slightly ahead and in the same lane as the ego vehicle. The ego car's movement will be directly influenced by the actions of this bus, particularly if it stops to pick up or drop off passengers.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian with a dog crossing the street in front of the ego vehicle. The pedestrian has the right of way, and their presence in the crosswalk means the ego vehicle must stop to allow them to cross safely.\n\nThe traffic light in view has a green light illuminated, indicating that the ego car is allowed to proceed through the intersection. However, caution is advised due to the pedestrian crossing the street. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

It should remain stationary until the pedestrian is safely on the sidewalk. The vehicle should also monitor the buses' signals closely to anticipate any potential movement and prepare to yield to them if they begin to move into the path of the ego vehicle. Maintain a safe distance from the buses, keep an eye out for any other vulnerable road users that may enter the roadway, and proceed through the intersection with caution once the pedestrian has crossed and it is safe to do so, following standard traffic laws and signals. The vehicle's speed should be adjusted to ensure adequate reaction time for any unforeseen events due to the poor nighttime visibility. After the road is clear, proceed with caution, anticipating the possibility that the bus may start moving."
