        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image analyzed, there is one large truck ahead of our vehicle in the same lane, evidently moving slowly or paused, as indicated by its illuminated tail lights. This situation necessitates that our autonomous vehicle might need to either slow down or change lanes to maintain safety and navigate around the truck. Additionally, reflective traffic cones are set up on the right side of the vehicle, hinting at possible road works or lane closures. These cones outline the drivable section of the road, compelling the vehicle to keep a safe distance and avoid merging to the left. Furthermore, there is a concrete barrier located on the right side beyond the truck that defines the edge between the roadway and a construction or secured zone. The barrier poses a restriction, as it prevents the vehicle from shifting right to evade this obstruction, thus narrowing the available operative maneuvers. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other objects identified in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or follow the truck at a safe distance, considering the mobility is limited due to obstacles and traffic cones. Drivers should be alert to any changes in traffic patterns or any indications from the truck that it may be preparing to move or is stopped due to ongoing road construction. It is also wise to use turn signals in advance if needing or safely changing lanes. Since it is nighttime, the vehicle should also rely on headlights and any additional sensors to improve visibility for detecting unexpected obstacles.",

The presence of such a vehicle will likely impact the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring increased following distance to ensure safe stopping and maneuverability, as well as potentially necessitating a reduced speed to match the flow of traffic.",

It is typically used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, although they can also be used to block off an area. Because this traffic cone is pictured in a line with others, it signals that the ego vehicle should not cross into the area the cones are protecting. The driver should steer to maintain a safe distance from these cones to avoid any potential hazards in the area they are designating.",
