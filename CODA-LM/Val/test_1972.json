On the right side of the road, there are multiple vehicles parked, partially visible due to obstructions. While these stationary vehicles do not pose an immediate threat, their presence signals a populated area where increased caution is necessary.\n\nThere is a triangular warning sign with an exclamation mark and a round speed limit sign indicating a maximum speed of 30 km/h. These signs alert the ego car to potential hazards ahead and mandate reducing speed to or below the specified limit.\n\nAdditionally, temporary yellow construction barriers are positioned along the edge of the road, effectively narrowing the lanes. This signals ongoing construction or road work, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and possibly merge into another lane.\n\nLastly, the environment is characterized by dusk or night time lighting conditions, necessitating the use of headlights. Reduced visibility in such conditions can lower reaction times to obstacles, thus requiring the ego car to remain particularly vigilant."
