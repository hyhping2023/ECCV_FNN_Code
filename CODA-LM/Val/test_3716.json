This parked vehicle could limit the space available for the ego car to maneuver and potentially hide pedestrians or other road users that might emerge from behind it. Additionally, several individuals are spotted on the right side of the road, with a crowd and goods partially obstructing the carriageway. They present a possible hazard as they might step into the path of the ego vehicle. There are also animals, which appear to be dogs, near these people. These animals may enter the roadway unpredictably, introducing a risk for oncoming traffic.\n\nDespite the presence of these road users, there are no traffic signs immediately affecting the ego car's driving decisions, which means that standard road rules will be followed. Furthermore, no traffic lights are discerned in the image, so the ego car should use general road rules and right-of-way to dictate its progression.\n\nNo traffic cones are observed in the scene, and there are no barriers present. However, there are makeshift stalls and goods placed along the right side of the road, very close to the driving lane. These stalls and goods could cause pedestrians to make sudden movements as they interact with the vendors or browse items, which requires the ego car to stay alert to avoid any potential incidents."
