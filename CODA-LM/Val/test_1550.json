A row of stationary vehicles is parked on the right side of the road, limiting the available width for maneuvering. The parked vehicles reduce the road's drivable space, requiring the ego vehicle to stay clear to avoid collisions and to be cautious of potential door openings or pedestrians emerging.\n\nTwo vulnerable road users are visible: a cyclist ahead moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, and a person riding a three-wheeled cart, also moving in the same direction. Cyclists and three-wheeled carts are less predictable and more vulnerable, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance and is prepared to adjust speed or change lanes to safely overtake if necessary.\n\nA 'No Parking' sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating that parking is not allowed in the area. However, given the presence of parked vehicles, this rule may not be enforced. While the ego vehicle doesnâ€™t need to take specific action, it should remain aware of local traffic regulations.\n\nConcrete bollards are present on the right side of the road, outlining the edge of the driving lane. These barriers are likely to separate the pedestrian walkway from the road, requiring the ego vehicle to stay within the lane limits to avoid hitting them.\n\nLastly, a dustbin is on the sidewalk, and a white bag is on the ground next to one of the parked vehicles. These objects pose no immediate risk but should be monitored in case they enter the roadway."

Additionally, maintain a lower speed to safely navigate between the parked cars on the right and the moving cyclist, and be vigilant for any doors opening from the parked vehicles or pedestrians stepping onto the road. The car should continuously monitor the situation for any changes, such as the bags near the dustbin entering the roadway or any pedestrians stepping out from between parked vans."
