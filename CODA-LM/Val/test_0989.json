However, there is vulnerability among road users, specifically a security guard who is standing beside a guard booth to the right of the road, near the barrier gate. The guard's presence suggests that the road is a controlled access point and that the vehicle must be authorized to proceed.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs or lights to be seen, there are multiple orange and white traffic cones positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. These traffic cones are set up to create a boundary on the approach to the gate, indicating to the vehicle that it is not allowed to proceed straight past the barrier without permission; they serve as a visual cue to stop or to seek clearance from the security guard.\n\nFurthermore, there is a lowered barrier gate directly in the path of the ego vehicle, which appears to be a controlled access point to a facility. The barrier acts as a physical obstacle, indicating that the vehicle must stop and may require permission to proceed or will need to find an alternate route.\n\nNo other objects are present in the image that could impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
