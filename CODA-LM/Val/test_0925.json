It is positioned in the left lane and occupies most of it. This truck presents a potential hazard due to its size and the reduced maneuverability typically associated with such heavy vehicles, which can affect stopping distance and lateral movements.\n\nSecondly, a van is visible to the right of the ego vehicle, also seemingly in motion. It occupies the right lane with its rear lights on. The van's proximity and parallel trajectory to the ego vehicle suggest that awareness of the van's movements is critical, especially if the van or the ego vehicle intends to change lanes.\n\nStreet lighting is visible, but no traffic lights can be seen in the image. This means the ego car must rely on other cues and road users for driving decisions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle. It is distinguished by its large size, specialized equipment at the rear, and bright taillights indicating its presence on the road. Due to its size and function, this vehicle may move slower than other traffic and could be making frequent stops or maneuvers. Future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance, being prepared for potential sudden changes in the construction vehicle's speed or direction, and being cautious when overtaking, as the construction vehicle may occupy more than one lane or have blind spots.",

Monitor the rear lights and signals of the truck for any sudden changes in speed or direction. Additionally, keep aware of the van to the right; check mirrors and blind spots before making any lane changes to ensure the van is not attempting the same maneuver. Adjust speed to match the flow of traffic while respecting speed limits and road conditions. Stay alert due to the nighttime conditions, drive with appropriate headlights on, and watch for any changes in the road conditions that might affect traction or visibility. Maintain a safe following distance from the minivan, monitoring its brake lights for cues on when to slow down or stop. Additionally, since the road appears wet, reduce speed to allow for increased reaction time and stopping distance. Keep a lateral distance from the cement mixer truck to the right to avoid its blind spots and be prepared for potential wide turns it may take. Use low-beam headlights to ensure visibility to other road users without causing glare."
