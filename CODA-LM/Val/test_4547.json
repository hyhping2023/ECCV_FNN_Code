Additionally, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones observed in this scenario.\n\nHowever, concrete barriers have been installed on both sides of the lane, marking the boundary of a construction area. These barriers suggest that the driving path is becoming narrower, requiring the autonomous vehicle to exercise caution in order to maintain its position within the lane.\n\nMoreover, there is a collection of construction materials stacked at the roadside. These materials could present a potential danger if they were to spill onto the driving path. It is crucial that drivers, including autonomous vehicle systems, stay alert to the possibility of such hazards and are prepared to respond appropriately."

Pay attention to any changes in speed limits indicated by construction signs or personnel. Stay alert to any traffic pattern changes that may be caused by road construction. Stay in the current lane, drive safely within the speed limit posted for the construction area, and always be aware of construction workers or debris that may be present on the road. As visibility is good and there are no direct obstacles in this lane, there is no need for emergency maneuvers at this time. Keep a safe distance from the car in front in the right lane, monitor changes in traffic flow from a distance, and stay alert to any signs that may indicate roadwork or lane closures. Comply with standard road rules and follow speed limits, as there are currently no immediate traffic signs or signals in view that necessitate a particular change in driving behavior.",
