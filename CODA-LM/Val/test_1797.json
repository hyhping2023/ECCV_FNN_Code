Ahead, there are several cars with visible tail lights that appear to be stopped on the road. This suggests there might be dense traffic or potential congestion. As a result, the ego vehicle should be prepared for the possibility that these vehicles may abruptly slow down, stop, or change lanes, requiring a corresponding adjustment in speed or lane position.\n\nAdditionally, there's a vehicle in the oncoming lane with its high beams on, likely impairing visibility for the ego car's driver due to glare. This could affect the perception of the road ahead and must be cautiously managed.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a reflective cleaning cart to the right, near an obstacle. Even though it is not an immediate hazard to the ego vehicle, it is important to remain vigilant of such roadside objects. There might be a risk of a pedestrian unexpectedly stepping out from behind the cleaning cart, necessitating rapid reaction from the driver.\n\nWith no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported, these categories do not require attention in the current context."

    "driving_suggestion": "When the green traffic light is on, the vehicle should proceed with caution, maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, and stay alert to any changes in the traffic lights or the vehicles in front. The presence of obstacles and traffic cones requires the vehicle to be prepared to handle potential obstructions and to slow down safely when passing through the area. Additionally, due to wet road conditions, the vehicle should also be driven carefully and be ready at all times to maneuver around partly obscured obstacles. The vehicle should also be prepared to respond to any additional traffic signs or road conditions that may indicate road construction or changes in the traffic flow.",
