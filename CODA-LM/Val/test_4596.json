The truck occupies most of the lane width, which may obscure visibility for the ego car and necessitates maintaining a larger following distance to ensure safe driving. In addition, there are multiple traffic cones placed diagonally on the road, guiding traffic away from the rightmost side of the lane, suggesting that there might be a road hazard or construction area ahead. Drivers are implied to shift lanes or reduce speed accordingly. Furthermore, there is a continuous barrier running alongside the left lane, which restricts the ability to perform lateral movements and acts to segregate opposite flows of traffic, ensuring safety on the road. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving behavior."

Its large size and weight affect its braking distance and maneuverability. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance if it's behind the truck and be cautious when overtaking, as the truck's blind spots are significantly larger than those of smaller vehicles.",
