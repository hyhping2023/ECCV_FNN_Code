A white truck is parked on the right side of the ego vehicle, adjacent to construction barriers, partially obstructing the lane. This requires the ego vehicle to potentially adjust its trajectory or slow down to navigate the reduced lane space safely. Additionally, a silver sedan is present in the opposite lane, facing the ego vehicle with its headlights on. While the sedan is not in the same lane, the headlights could cause glare, impacting the ego vehicle's visibility.\n\nThere is also a yellow and black striped barrier sign attached to the construction barriers, indicating a road obstruction ahead. This sign serves as a warning for drivers to slow down and exercise increased caution due to the upcoming construction work.\n\nTo assist in traffic management around the construction site, multiple orange and white traffic cones are placed in front of the barriers. These cones are meant to guide vehicles safely around the construction site, indicating that the ego vehicle will need to navigate around the obstruction.\n\nConcrete and metal barriers have been erected, creating a partition in the road for a construction area to the right of the ego vehicle. These barriers serve to reduce the lane width and direct traffic away from the construction zone, ensuring the safety of both the workers and the road users.\n\nNo other vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects are reported in the scene."

The vehicle should also watch for any potential oncoming traffic that may affect safe passage past the construction zone. The glare from the oncoming vehicle's headlights should be considered, and the ego vehicle should prepare to avoid any sudden bright light impairing the driver's vision. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to follow the detour as indicated by the traffic signs and barriers. It should stay alert for any temporary traffic lights, construction workers, or additional signage not visible in this image. Additionally, it must be prepared for the glare from oncoming vehicles' headlights by adjusting its own lighting if necessary to maintain visibility. Switching on the vehicle's headlights (if not already on) would also be advisable to increase visibility to others if the environment is dark."
