Additionally, it may move suddenly, which would require the vehicle to adjust its driving behavior.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:** \n- Pedestrians are seated and standing by the roadside stall, right beside our vehicle. Although these pedestrians are currently not on the road, they may step onto it, necessitating careful driving.\n\n**Barriers:** \n- There is a temporary green construction enclosure on the left side of the road. These obstacles compress road space and alter traffic patterns, which requires caution.\n\n**Other Objects:** \n- Reflections visible on the windshield, possibly originating from inside the vehicle itself. While these reflections do not directly affect driving, they may reduce the driver's visibility and should be minimized as much as possible.\n- Several stationary objects, such as street furniture and flags, are present around the area and may obstruct the vehicle's view of pedestrians stepping out. These static objects close to the traffic flow may obscure other road users, increasing the risk of unexpected obstacles appearing in the vehicle's path of travel.\n- A roadside stall is located on the right, which may attract pedestrian activity. Such stalls may cause an increase in pedestrian traffic, and these pedestrians may cross or encroach upon the roadway."

    "driving_suggestion": "When approaching areas with pedestrians and parked trucks, proceed with caution and maintain a safe distance from roadside activities. Be prepared for individuals potentially entering the roadway and accordingly reduce your speed. Stay alert for any environmental changes, such as the opening of vehicle doors or pedestrians stepping out suddenly. Continue monitoring for traffic control devices that may be present but not visible in the current view. Signal clearly when passing parked vehicles and bicycles to inform other road users of your intentions. It is recommended to regularly check rearview and side mirrors to be aware of other vehicles that may attempt to overtake. When passing parked vans and motorcycles, the vehicle should maintain reduced speed to ensure safe passage. Be mindful of any indications that bicycles may enter the traffic flow or pedestrians may walk onto the road. If conditions permit, the vehicle should change lanes to the left to increase the distance from roadside activities, but only proceed if it is safe and does not affect other traffic.",
