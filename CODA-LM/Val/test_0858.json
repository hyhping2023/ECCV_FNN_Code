It requires a safe following distance due to its slow speed and size, or the ego car might need to consider a lane change.\n2. **White Box Truck**: Positioned ahead and to the right in the right lane, identifiable by its closed rear section and registration plate. The ego car must monitor for potential unexpected maneuvers such as slowing down, stopping, or lane changing.\n3. **White Commercial Truck**: In the adjacent left lane with its side marked 'BJT 372', visible to the ego vehicle. The movements of this truck may influence the ego vehicle’s lane change opportunities.\n4. **Multiple Cars**: Surrounding traffic includes a dark gray SUV ahead in the adjacent right lane, and several vehicles in front of it, reflecting the general traffic flow conditions affecting the ego vehicle's navigation.\n\n**Traffic Signs**:\n1. **Red and White Traffic Posts**: Located to the left, marking the boundaries of the lane, these posts indicate that the ego car needs to stay within the marked lane to avoid safety hazards.\n\n**Traffic Lights**:\n1. **Traffic Light**: Visible ahead but the signal color is not discernible from the image. The signal phase will dictate whether the ego vehicle can proceed or must stop, though the current state is unknown.\n\n**Traffic Cones**:\n1. **Red and White Traffic Cones**: Positioned on the left edge of the ego vehicle's lane, demarcating road works or a boundary. The ego car needs to maintain a safe distance to avoid contact and stay within the correct lane.\n\n**Barriers**:\n1. **Concrete Barriers (Left)**: Indicating a construction zone or road partition, these barriers limit lateral movement and require caution.\n2. **Concrete Barrier (Right)**: On the right side of the rightmost lane, it separates the lanes of traffic from the sidewalk or other off-road areas, limiting the ego vehicle’s maneuverability to the left side when considering lane changes.\n\nThese elements combined create a complex driving environment that requires careful navigation and constant awareness of surroundings for safe driving behavior."

Stay alert for any sudden movements from the box truck to the right and other nearby vehicles. Continue to monitor the surrounding traffic and remain within the lane boundaries marked by the traffic posts. Given the concrete mixer truck's positioning, the ego vehicle should assess the left lane for a safe lane change opportunity to bypass the obstruction. The traffic conditions in the adjacent lanes should be closely monitored to find a gap to merge safely. It's essential to keep a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck and prepare to react to the traffic light's signal, which remains unknown. The traffic cones and barriers further emphasize the necessity for caution when changing lanes. The ego vehicle should not undertake any maneuvers until it's safe to do so without risking collision with surrounding vehicles or violating traffic rules."
