It is stationary, apparently waiting for a red traffic light to change. This vehicle is of immediate relevance because it obstructs the path of the ego car, necessitating that the ego car remains stopped until the scooter moves forward.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:** There are pedestrians observed on the right side of the road. Some are close to the curb, while others are further away, either crossing the street or preparing to cross. These pedestrians may potentially enter the roadway, compelling the ego car to either yield or stop to ensure their safety.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights:** A traffic light is visible in the distance, displaying a red signal for vehicles intending to proceed straight. This red light mandates that the ego car, along with other vehicles, must stay stationary until the light turns green, dictating the movement of traffic at this juncture.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that impact driving behavior or decision-making in this specific scenario."

The ego car should only proceed when the traffic light turns green and it is safe to do so, taking care not to endanger the pedestrians that may be crossing or are near the street."
