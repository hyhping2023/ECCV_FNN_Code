This truck might be involved in construction work, loading or unloading, or could be broken down, suggesting potential lane obstruction and requiring the ego vehicle to be alert and possibly change lanes.\n- A red truck is present to the right of the ego vehicle, with reflective markings, partially visible from the front. Its position and orientation imply it could be pulling away or parked, necessitating vigilance as it may enter the ego vehicle's lane or obstruct the view.\n\n**Traffic signs:**\n- There is a blue sign with a 'P' crossed out indicating 'No Parking' visible on the right side of the image, mounted on a light pole. This informs the ego vehicle that parking is not allowed in this section, which is important for understanding local parking regulations.\n\n**Traffic cones:**\n- Orange traffic cones are placed on the road to the left side beside the truck, leading up to a presumed work site or obstacle. These cones indicate a roadwork site or obstruction ahead, signaling that the ego vehicle should avoid this area and possibly change lanes if it is safe to do so.\n\n**Barriers:**\n- Temporary barrier walls are present on the right, indicating a construction zone or road partition.

Moreover, assess the lane beside the truck to determine if it is safe to merge right to avoid the traffic cones and any potential obstruction due to the visible road work. Additionally, the driver should adhere to the 'No Parking' sign and not consider parking in this area. Continuous monitoring of the roadside work environment for any changes is important to maintain safety and adjust driving behavior accordingly. The ego vehicle should also stay alert for any movement from the red truck which could indicate a potential merging or lane change, and prepare to follow any new traffic patterns due to the barriers and traffic cones."
