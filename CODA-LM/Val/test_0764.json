        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are vehicles and vulnerable road users present.\n\nStarting with vehicles, I observe two distinct elements. There's a white car on the left side which has its headlights on and is facing towards the camera. It is traveling in the opposite direction, occupying the opposite lane. While the white car can be distracting with its headlights on, it currently does not pose an immediate threat to the ego car's path. Additionally, there is a grey van parked on the right side of the road. This van is stationary and partially obstructs the ego vehicle's lane, compelling the ego car to either alter its trajectory or come to a complete stop if there isn't enough room to pass.\n\nIn the vicinity of the white car, there are vulnerable road users present. Specifically, there are persons who are close to the white car, and one appears to be standing either in the road or near its edge, actively engaged in some task. Their proximity to the roadway presents a potential hazard, requiring that the ego vehicle proceed with reduced speed and enhanced caution, ready to respond to any sudden or unexpected movements that may encroach upon the vehicle's progression.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene."

It should prepare to change lanes or adjust its path to avoid the partially obstructing parked van, while also keeping a watchful eye for the persons near the roadway, ready to stop if needed to ensure their safety. Additionally, due to the potentially slick road, the ego vehicle should increase following distances and avoid any sudden steering or braking movements to maintain control of the vehicle."
