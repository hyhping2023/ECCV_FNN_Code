As it takes up some of the driving lane, this vehicle could become a hazard if it starts moving unexpectedly.\n\nDirectly ahead in the road, a yellow construction vehicle with flashing lights is seen, indicating active road work, which disrupts traffic flow and may be blocking the path of travel.\n\nFurther down, there is a noticeable congestion of various vehicles navigating the area around the construction zone. This mixture of stopped and moving vehicles, indicated by both taillights and headlights, requires the ego car to drive cautiously and stay alert for any sudden halts or changes in direction.\n\nAdditionally, there is oncoming traffic including a large truck on the right, which is particularly important as it necessitates the ego car to keep a safe distance from the centerline and be wary of any potential unexpected moves from those vehicles.\n\nA traffic sign is posted on the right, close to the construction vehicle, displaying information or warnings pertaining to the construction work. The content of this sign, which is likely important for understanding any road closures, detour routes, or reduced speed zones, should be heeded by the driver.\n\nLining the left side of the road, traffic cones have been set out next to the sidewalk and encroach slightly onto the road, marking the boundary of the ongoing construction work. These cones serve as indicators for the ego vehicle to remain on the right-hand side and notify the driver of any necessary lane shifts.\n\nLastly, there is a pile of what appears to be construction debris or materials situated beside the traffic cones, to the left of the ego car. This could lessen the available lane space or cause an obstruction, compelling the ego car to alter its course and maybe adjust its velocity."

Prepare for a possible stop or lane shift if directed by signage or road markings. Always be ready to yield to construction traffic entering or leaving the site. Additionally, it must prepare to possibly change lanes to the right if the left lane is obstructed or closed due to road work. It should also monitor the parked car for movement.
