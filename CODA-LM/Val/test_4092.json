        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects:\n\nFirstly, there is a large green cement mixer truck directly in front of the ego car, taking up a significant portion of the driving lane. Its mixer drum and equipment are visible, with some concrete residue. This truck potentially limits the ego car's visibility and maneuvering space. Additionally, there is a white sedan on the right side of the road, slightly ahead, but it does not immediately affect the driving behavior since it is not obstructing traffic.\n\nNext, a white sedan is traveling in the adjacent lane to the left of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car must monitor this vehicle for potential lane changes or speed adjustments as these actions could affect the ego carâ€™s lane-changing capability.\n\nThere is a directional sign attached to the traffic light post, though its details are indistinct. There is also a street sign on the right, indicating the name of the cross street or providing directional information. These signs are essential for navigation and location awareness.\n\nA traffic light positioned on the left side above the road, attached to an overhanging structure, shows a green light for the ego car's direction of travel. This green light indicates the ego car has the right of way to proceed.\n\nA solid barrier to the left of the ego car separates the pedestrian walkway from the road. This barrier indicates there is no pedestrian crossing in the immediate vicinity and helps prevent pedestrians from unpredictably entering the roadway.\n\nAdditionally, graffiti-covered walls on the left beyond the barrier indicate an urban environment. Although these walls do not directly affect driving conditions, urban environments can have unpredictable elements, necessitating extra caution."

            "description and explanation": "This image contains a traffic light with three color segments, typically red, yellow, and green. The light is responsible for directing vehicular traffic at intersections by indicating when vehicles should stop, prepare to proceed, or move through the intersection. The current color illuminated determines the immediate action needed by the driver of the ego car. If the light is red, the driver must come to a complete stop. If it is yellow, the driver should prepare to stop unless they are too close to safely do so, in which case they can proceed with caution. A green light means the driver can continue driving through the intersection.",

Be prepared to make a lane change if the opportunity arises and it is safe to do so in order to overtake the mixer truck. Monitor the traffic light and be prepared to stop if it changes, but currently proceed with caution under the green light. Pay attention to the white sedan on the right should it merge back into traffic, although it is currently not a direct concern. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the white sedan in the adjacent lane for any sudden lane changes. Prepare to adjust speed or change lanes if the white sedan engages in an unexpected maneuver, while also being mindful of the lane designations indicated by overhead signs. Since the traffic light is green, continue to proceed but remain vigilant for changes in the light and potential activity around the intersection ahead. Keep an eye on any pedestrians that may appear from behind barriers or corners. Remain attentive to the road conditions and other road users not visible in the current scene."
