        "description and explanation": "The image reveals multiple road users and objects that can affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nFirstly, there are various vehicles on the road. On the two lanes ahead, there are cars and a large green sanitation truck on the right side. Additionally, a large gray truck with green stripes on the right lane partially obstructs the view ahead. These vehicles reduce the available road space and may necessitate lane changes, requiring cautious driving and maintaining a distance for monitoring. The gray truck, due to its size and position, blocks the view of the road and traffic ahead, necessitating extra caution. In the middle-left lane in the distance, there is a white sedan, while directly in front of the ego car is a white commercial vehicle with blue and white stripes. These vehicles, although distant, can change speed or lanes, which impacts reaction time. Further ahead, several vehicles including white trucks and cars are distributed across two lanes, traveling in the same or opposite direction as the current vehicle. These form the current traffic flow and influence driving decisions.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones placed diagonally starting from the right side of the lane, indicating a potential hazard or road work, guiding towards a lane closure or a shift to the left lane. These cones suggest lane narrowing or closure, requiring cautious driving and possibly necessitating a safe lane change to the left.\n\nThere are no other vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects observed in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from large vehicles ahead, especially the green sanitation truck on the right, and be ready to change lanes when the road construction, indicated by traffic cones, encroaches on the current lane. Due to the distance, there is no need to take action regarding the white sedan and commercial vehicles ahead for now, but our vehicle should continue to monitor their speed and lane changes. In the absence of visible traffic signs and lights, our vehicle's driving mode should follow the standard road rules for the given type of road, including speed limits and right-of-way. Considering that the sanitation truck partially blocks the lane and the traffic cones indicate to move left, one should safely check the space and merge into the left lane. Wet road conditions require a reduction in speed and an increased following distance to ensure a safe stopping distance. Continuous observation of the vehicles ahead is crucial for predicting changes in traffic flow and further obstacles.",
