        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several vehicles and traffic cones noted, requiring attention for safe autonomous driving.\n\nFirstly, a red dump truck is spotted traveling in the opposite direction on the right lane. The presence of this large vehicle could limit visibility ahead for the ego car and there's a possibility of it stopping or making sudden turns, which necessitates cautious driving.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan is parked on the left side of the road. The risk here stems from the potential of passengers opening the car door unexpectedly or the vehicle suddenly merging into traffic, which could endanger passing vehicles.\n\nOn the opposite lane, there are white and gray cars driving which necessitates vigilant monitoring. This observation is crucial to preempt any sudden incursions into the ego vehicle's lane or other unusual movements that might pose risks.\n\nA gray car is also observed ahead in the opposite direction, indicating the need for maintaining a safe following distance. This measure is important to respond adequately to any sudden changes in the gray carâ€™s speed or direction.\n\nThe traffic scenario also involves orange traffic cones positioned on the right side of the lane. These cones signal a directive for vehicles to merge left, likely due to road construction or a lane closure. It's imperative for the autonomous vehicle to comply with this guidance and safely change lanes.\n\nIn this environment, it appears that there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, lights, barriers, or other notable objects requiring immediate attention. The described elements and their implications instruct autonomous vehicle behavior to ensure safety and compliance with traffic regulations."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the road construction marked by traffic cones, this vehicle should slow down and prepare to merge into the left lane, while maintaining a safe distance from the red dump truck ahead in case it suddenly stops or turns. Parked vehicles may open their doors or pull out unexpectedly, so careful driving is required to avoid collisions. This vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the gray car in front, be aware of oncoming traffic that may encroach, and drive cautiously to avoid any road irregularities.",
