Following the mandatory direction sign to turn right is also necessary unless the vehicle can lawfully change to another lane that allows for straight travel or turning left. Proceed with caution, especially due to wet road conditions and the reduced lane width because of the road work on the right. Stay attentive for any pedestrians potentially crossing and be prepared to change lanes to the left if necessary to avoid the stationary bus ahead. Reduce speed appropriately to account for potential hazards and changing road conditions."
