These parked vehicles do not immediately affect the ego car's path but require attention for potential door openings or pedestrians.\n   - A gray car is approaching from the opposite direction on the other side of a median. This vehicle is on a separate roadway and does not influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n   - A pedestrian wearing a red top is crossing the street in front of the ego car. The pedestrian has priority, necessitating the ego car to yield and ensure their safe passage.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs:**\n   - A directional sign ahead next to the pedestrian crossing indicates a left turn for traffic, guiding the ego car and other drivers on the available traffic movements.\n   - A No Parking sign is visible on the right, indicating no parking beyond that point. This sign serves an informational purpose as the ego car is not looking for a parking space.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights:**\n   - No traffic lights are visible in this image. This suggests that traffic flow may be governed by right-of-way rules at this junction or that the lights are positioned outside the visible area.\n\n5. **Traffic Cones:**\n   - Orange and white traffic cones are placed around a cordoned-off area on the right. These cones indicate a closed section of the road, likely for construction, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and avoid entering the cordoned-off area.\n\n6. **Barriers:**\n   - A yellow and black traffic barrier curves around a corner on the right side of the road, leading up to a blocked-off pathway. This barrier marks a restricted area that should be avoided, altering the drivable path for the ego car.\n\n7. **Other Objects:**\n   - Bags and cartons are placed on the curb on the right. These objects can be potential obstacles if they enter the roadway, necessitating that the ego car monitors them and is prepared to react if their position changes."

Avoid the area marked off by traffic cones and barriers, adjusting the driving path as needed while continuing to monitor the stationary objects on the curb. Proceed with caution once the pedestrian has crossed and the way is clear."
