    "driving_suggestion": "Vehicles should remain stationary at red traffic lights and when pedestrians are crossing the road. Due to the presence of pedestrians on the crosswalk and the tricycle ahead, cautious driving is required. Vehicles should monitor changes in traffic lights and may only proceed when the light turns green and pedestrians have safely reached the opposite side. It is advised to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead to allow sufficient reaction time in case of sudden traffic changes. Drivers should be prepared for the possibility of the tricycle stopping abruptly or moving slower than other vehicles after the light change. Vehicles should also ensure that headlights and brake lights are functioning properly for visibility to other vehicles. Once the traffic light turns green and the pedestrian crosswalk is clear, vehicles can cautiously resume driving, being mindful of the positions of other vehicles at the intersection.",
