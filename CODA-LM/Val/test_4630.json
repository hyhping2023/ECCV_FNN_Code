Additionally, multiple vehicles are observed ahead in the adjacent left lane, their movement potentially affecting the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nAlso present in the scene is a green traffic light ahead, informing the ego car that it can proceed with caution, while also being alert for possible changes in the traffic light state. A roadwork sign is also noted on the right side before a bridge, warning of potential obstructions or lane closures that may be encountered shortly.\n\nA series of orange traffic cones can be seen on the right, which narrow the driving lane, thereby indicating lane closures or roadworks that necessitate the ego car to maintain its lane position without drifting.\n\nThere is a concrete median barrier to the left, which separates the opposing directions of traffic, highlighting the limited ability for the ego car to maneuver to the left. A metal guardrail is located on the right side of the road, delineating the road's boundary, emphasizing that there is no shoulder available for stopping or for emergency purposes.\n\nThis summarized scene description includes all the essential information regarding the visible vehicles, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers, as well as the explanations of how each of these elements influences the driving behavior of the ego car."
