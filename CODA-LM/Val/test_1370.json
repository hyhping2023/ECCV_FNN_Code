This large vehicle could limit the ego car's visibility and reaction time to traffic changes, necessitating a safe following distance. To the left, a blue truck is traveling in the opposite direction with another truck visible behind it, indicating heavy traffic and the need for the ego car to monitor these vehicles for any potential lane changes or merges.\n\nFurther ahead, multiple vehicles are present in both directions, including a red car moving towards the ego car. These vehicles contribute to the overall traffic pattern, influencing the required pace and spacing for safe driving. Additionally, there is a truck to the right of the ego car in an adjacent lane, moving forward, which means the ego car must be cautious of possible lane changes from this truck or other vehicles.\n\nA 'No Entry' sign for opposing traffic is visible above the road, next to the traffic lights. Although it doesn't directly affect the ego car, it does inform about restrictions that could impact the flow of oncoming traffic. The traffic lights ahead of the ego car display a green signal, allowing traffic to proceed, indicating that the ego car can continue moving forward, provided the path is clear and it's safe to do so.\n\nYellow and black striped safety barriers are positioned on the right side of the intersection, marking a potential hazard area and guiding the ego car to stay clear of that section. Similarly, barricades on the left suggest a portion of the road may be cordoned off, potentially reducing lanes and requiring the ego car to adjust its speed and position to safely navigate the narrowed road space."
