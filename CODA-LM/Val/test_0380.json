To the left side of the gate, there is a 'No Entry' sign clearly conveying that vehicles are not permitted to access the area, guiding the ego car to avoid proceeding any further. Additionally, a sequence of traffic cones is strategically aligned in a row leading up to the closed gate, serving as a physical guide for vehicles to not advance past them, in adherence to the road closure. Complementing these indicators is a physical barrier gate that is lowered, extending across the entire road width, which unequivocally signifies that the road is not available for vehicular traffic at this time. Consequently, these barriers dictate that the ego car must not attempt to cross. Lastly, situated to the right of the closed gate is a security guard booth, which might suggest the presence of a security officer capable of delivering further instructions or information about the road status, implying that there might be a need for an interaction with the security personnel or the possibility of obtaining additional directions due to the current road situation. Other categories such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, and traffic lights are not present in this particular image."
