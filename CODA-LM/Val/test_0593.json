        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene ahead, there are several road users and objects of interest. Firstly, there is a red vehicle parked by the roadside ahead, with its trunk open, and an individual appears to be either loading or unloading items while leaning on the rear of the car. The presence of this vehicle and the people around it suggests that there could be impediments to the smooth flow of traffic, and caution is required since pedestrians might move in close proximity to the moving traffic.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are stationary on the left side of the road. These parked vehicles reduce the overall width available for vehicular movement, potentially concealing pedestrians or other objects that could enter the driving lane, necessitating vigilance from the autonomous driving system.\n\nA specific pedestrian is noted next to the open trunk of the parked red vehicle, engaged in handling items within the trunk. This situation warrants attention because there is a possibility that the pedestrian might step into the pathway of oncoming vehicles, prompting the need for the autonomous vehicle to be ready to decelerate or come to a halt if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image. However, on the right side of the road, there is a line-up of bicycles parked in an orderly manner. While they currently pose no immediate threat as they are stationary, it remains important to monitor the area in case someone approaches to use the bicycles, which could alter the dynamics on the road. \n\nThe autonomous vehicle should navigate this environment with an appropriate level of caution to ensure safe passage through the vicinity while monitoring for any changes in the behavior of the road users and the potential introduction of new elements into the scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "When approaching the parked red vehicle, slow down and be prepared to stop in case a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the road. At the same time, maintain a safe distance from the vehicles parked on the left side to have enough reaction time in case a car door suddenly opens or a pedestrian emerges from between the vehicles. Slow down when approaching stationary vehicles and prepare to navigate around them safely. Before attempting to overtake, carefully check for oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. Stay alert to other road users who might be around, including those who may approach parked bicycles.",

Due to the proximity to the vehicle, the pedestrian may be loading or unloading items from the trunk.
