The rear lights of the sedan are on, indicating either the engine is running or there is a driver inside. This vehicle presents a potential hazard as it might suddenly enter traffic, requiring the ego vehicle to stay alert and be ready to react. The presence of the parked white sedan also affects the drivable area, potentially necessitating a lane change or a reduction in speed for safe navigation.\n\nAdditionally, there are stationary objects, possibly machinery or construction equipment, positioned on either side of the road. While these objects do not pose a direct threat, they compel the ego vehicle to stay centered on the road to avoid any accidental contact."

The vehicle appears to be stationary and could be equipped with special equipment used for construction tasks. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this vehicle and be alert for any construction workers or additional construction-related obstacles in the vicinity. If the construction vehicle is part of active road work, there could be lane closures or detours ahead, requiring the driver of the ego car to potentially slow down, stop, or follow posted signs for a different travel route.",

Depending on whether this car is moving or stationary, the ego car must adjust its speed and following distance accordingly. If the car is stationary, there may be a reason for it such as a traffic light, stop sign, or obstruction ahead.

Maintain reliance on headlights and sensors to compensate for low visibility conditions, and be ready to react to changes in the traffic environment."
