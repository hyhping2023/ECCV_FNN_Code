Considering the size of the vehicle and the flashing lights, this indicates that the vehicle is engaged in construction or maintenance work, which may obstruct the lane."

        "description and explanation": "The traffic image presents a scene with multiple road users and elements that impact driving decisions. There are two vehicles present: one is a commercial vehicle with a cement mixer in the right lane showing red taillights, suggesting it might start moving and due to its large size and cargo, it could affect maneuverability and require a longer distance for braking. As it seems to be involved in construction, it may block the lane temporarily. The second vehicle is a sedan ahead in the left lane, also with taillights on, indicating it might be moving at a speed similar to the commercial truck. Its position will influence our vehicle's decisions regarding the timing and the safety of overtaking.\n\nThe traffic light observed displays a green signal for going straight and a red light for turning left, instructing our vehicle to proceed straight while holding any left turn maneuvers until the light changes.\n\nLastly, two types of barriers are noted. A guardrail is situated on the right side of the road, restricting the available space for maneuvering and acting as a safety measure to keep vehicles on the road. Another barrier is seen, distinguishing the boundary between the pedestrian area and the road itself, emphasizing that vehicles must remain within the limits of the road space. No vulnerable road users, traffic cones, traffic signs, or other objects are reported in the image."

Consider the state of the road and remain cautious, especially when passing large vehicles in the right lane, such as commercial vehicles or trucks. Avoid making unsafe turns and adhere to traffic rules indicated by signs and lights.",

The presence of a construction vehicle on the road indicates that there might be ongoing road work or construction in the vicinity. The ego car will need to be cautious, reduce speed, and be prepared for potential obstacles, detours, or instructions from road workers. It is also important to be vigilant for any additional construction signs or signals that may be present around the construction vehicle. Due to the size and nature of the vehicle, it may also make sudden stops or movements, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.",
