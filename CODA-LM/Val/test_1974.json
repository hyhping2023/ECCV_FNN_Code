This presence of the vehicle might influence the driving behavior of the ego car, as it indicates a potential traffic regulation or an obstruction ahead that needs to be acknowledged. Additionally, the scene includes traffic lights mounted on a portable structure in the middle of the road, with a green arrow illuminated, pointing to the left. This green arrow signals that the ego car is permitted to continue, but exclusively through making a left turn, implying the right path is likely obstructed or closed for through traffic. Moreover, yellow and black striped barriers are positioned in the middle of the road beneath the temporary traffic lights, steering the traffic to the left. These barriers imply there might be a road closure or ongoing construction on the right side of the road, necessitating a left turn for vehicles. Vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, and other objects do not appear in this particular traffic scene, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the driving conditions at this moment."

It is also advised to monitor any changes in the traffic lights and be aware of other vehicles that may be following the same detour. Maintain a safe distance from the car ahead, monitor the speed and behavior of traffic, and be prepared to respond to the traffic signals. As the car is approaching a green light, the ego car should proceed with caution due to the barrier ahead that may involve a change in traffic patterns. Stay alert for any roadworks signs or additional traffic guidance that may affect the flow of traffic."
