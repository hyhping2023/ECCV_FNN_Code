        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a dark-colored hatchback on the right side of our vehicle, traveling in a similar direction and at a similar speed. The presence of this vehicle suggests that it may potentially merge or change lanes, which could affect the driving route of our car. Additionally, various vehicles are parked on both sides of the street, which has narrowed the driving lane and may obstruct the view of pedestrians or other road users who might step onto the road. It is also important to be aware of vehicles on the opposite lane to prevent accidents, especially when overtaking slower road users ahead.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is someone walking on the right side of the road, moving parallel to the vehicles. This poses a risk as the person may enter the roadway, requiring the vehicle to be prepared to slow down or stop at any moment. There is also a cyclist in the center of the image riding in the direction of traffic. Cyclists share the road with vehicles, and their presence affects the positioning and overtaking decisions of autonomous vehicles.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the road, there are street carts and possible debris. These objects may obstruct traffic or become hazards if they enter the road.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered in this summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "This vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the electric scooter ahead, be ready to decelerate to avoid pedestrians near the roadside, and monitor any lane change movements of the hatchback on the right. Due to oncoming traffic and parked vehicles reducing visibility and available space, extra caution is needed when overtaking. Given the unclear lane markings and the potential risk of pedestrians or other objects entering the driving path, high alertness must be maintained. The vehicle should also be prepared to respond to the actions of the van and any unexpected behavior from parked or moving vehicles. It is recommended to continuously monitor for new obstacles or changes in the behavior of other road users on the road.",
