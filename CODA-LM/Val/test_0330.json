On the sidewalk to the right, several pedestrians are visible, some of whom appear to be crossing the road in front of a car, necessitating caution and readiness to yield.\n\nThere are also several traffic signs. One signpost on the right is currently illegible, though its presence suggests that there might be changes to road rules or conditions that autonomous vehicles must be prepared to comply with. Another sign on the right displays available turns or lanes, significantly impacting navigation decisions as the vehicle approaches a turn or needs to change lanes.\n\nOn the right side, a barrier separates the pedestrian area from the roadway, ensuring pedestrian safety and vehicle lane adherence. Additionally, a series of bright lights from nearby buildings or street lamps enhance visibility but may cause glare, so the vehicle should adjust light settings and remain focused on the main road areas."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive cautiously, prepare to slow down or stop for vehicles ahead, and closely watch the movements of pedestrians, especially those who may cross the street. Be aware of the blue cone signs and maintain a safe distance from the designated area. Continue to follow the green traffic lights but be alert for any road users who may not obey their signals. The vehicle should travel at a moderate speed while paying attention to the movements of the car on the left and pedestrians on the right. The vehicle must stay in its current lane, respect the instructions of the traffic cone signs, and be cautious of potential glare from lights. The autonomous driving system must continuously monitor these factors and be ready to make necessary adjustments to ensure safety and compliance with traffic rules.",
