It is crucial for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance from the SUV to accommodate any potential changes in its speed or lane, ensuring a timely and safe response.\n\nAlso noticed is a traffic sign on the right side of the road, indicating either an upcoming intersection or a lane merge from the right. This sign alerts the vehicle to be vigilant for traffic joining from the right side and to be ready to alter its speed or lane position if necessary.\n\nA low, continuous concrete barrier running parallel to the lane and located on the right side creates a bounded region between the road and a green area. This barrier necessitates that the vehicle stays within its lane boundaries to prevent any collisions.\n\nNo other vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists, traffic lights, traffic cones, or miscellaneous objects are noted in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the SUV in front, observe its driving behavior, and be prepared to adjust your speed or change lanes at any time to respond to the SUV slowing down or stopping. Remain vigilant for potential obstacles or road construction indicated by traffic cones. Do not enter the broken lines on the right side as there are barriers; if you need to change lanes due to the SUV's actions or other unclear obstacles, signal in a timely manner and switch to the left lane when it is safe to do so. Be aware of merging traffic on the right which may occur due to guide signs.",

For the ego car, the presence of this barrier dictates that the driver should stay in their current lane and not attempt to drive over or around the barrier, which could be unsafe or illegal.",
