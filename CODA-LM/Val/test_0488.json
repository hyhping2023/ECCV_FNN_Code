It occupies most of the lane width, leaving limited space for overtaking. Due to its size and potential slower speed, the ego car should reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance. There is also a single orange traffic cone on the right shoulder of the road. This does not obstruct the driving lane but indicates there may be potential hazards or roadwork nearby, warranting increased caution and awareness of possible changes in traffic patterns. Additionally, a concrete barrier is present on the right side of the road, establishing a clear boundary for the driving lane and underscoring the necessity for the ego car to remain in its lane. Lastly, there is a red object, possibly a traffic cone or similar signaling device, on the grass beyond the barrier. Although this object does not affect the roadway directly, its presence—along with the traffic cone—could indicate upcoming road work or lane closures, suggesting that the ego car should be vigilant for additional signs or alterations in road conditions."

The presence of such a vehicle on the road usually indicates nearby construction activity. Being behind this type of vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance due to potential concrete spillage and the possibility that the vehicle might make sudden stops or turns into a construction site. Additionally, construction vehicles often move slower than other traffic, so the ego car may need to prepare for a lane change and overtake when safe and legal to do so.",

Stay alert for any roadwork or changes in traffic patterns indicated by the presence of the traffic cone, and adjust speed for wet road conditions. Keep an eye on the traffic cone to the right for any signs of roadwork or hazards and be prepared to react. Stay in the current lane to avoid the barrier to the right and continue monitoring the road ahead for any changes or additional road users that may affect driving decisions."
