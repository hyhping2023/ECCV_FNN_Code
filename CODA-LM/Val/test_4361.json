        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are three parked vehicles along the road. The first is a silver car positioned to the left of our vehicle, facing the same direction as ours. This car is currently stationary and is not expected to influence our driving behavior immediately, but it is crucial to keep an eye on it in case it starts moving. The second vehicle, a blue compact sedan, is parked on the right side, also facing the same direction as our car. Like the silver car, it is stationary for now, but it should be monitored for any sudden movements. The third vehicle is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, but with its front facing perpendicularly to our vehicle's direction. This car, while currently stationary, doesn't pose a direct threat but requires vigilant observation for any signs of movement.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there is a pedestrian walking close to the parked cars on the right side, near our vehicle. Given that pedestrians can unexpectedly change direction or attempt to cross the road, our vehicle must be ready to stop or slow down to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, a light-colored, small dog is seen walking on the driving lane on the right side of the road ahead. Unleashed pets on the road can be unpredictable and potentially hazardous, necessitating that vehicles decelerate and be prepared to halt if the situation calls for it.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other noteworthy objects reported in the scene, which simplifies the driving context to primarily watching for the behavior of parked vehicles, a pedestrian, and a small dog."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should proceed slowly and cautiously, paying close attention to pedestrians and animals on the road. Be prepared to brake at any moment in case a pedestrian or animal suddenly enters the lane. Exercise caution when passing parked vehicles, ensuring they do not move as you drive by. Slow down to allow enough reaction time if a parked vehicle suddenly moves. Pay close attention to pedestrians and dogs, and be ready to stop if a pedestrian approaches the road or a dog remains in the path of the vehicle. Ensure a safe distance is maintained from parked vehicles to avoid collisions when their doors open. Due to the limited maneuvering space caused by parked vehicles and the potential unpredictable movement of animals on the road, it is advisable to reduce speed and drive slowly. Be prepared to stop if an animal does not leave the road or a pedestrian steps onto it. Also, stay alert to the movements of silver vehicles and pedestrians who may walk onto the road from between parked vehicles. If possible, lightly honk the horn as a gentle reminder for animals to move, while avoiding any sudden movements that might startle them or pedestrians.",
