This vehicle affects the safe driving speed and the following distance that should be maintained. A truck ahead partly occupies both the right and left lanes and is predominantly white with the number '5' in a red circle on its back. Its position requires careful driving as it limits maneuvering options. Between the truck and the white sedan, a green vehicle is partially visible, possibly stationary or moving slowly in the lane in front of ours, indicating that traffic flow may be affected. Across the road, facing this car, a red vehicle is visible; although in the opposite lane, it could still impact our path by making sudden lane changes.\n\nTwo pedestrians are standing at the corner on the right side of the intersection in front of the car. Their proximity to the crossing area may necessitate the vehicle to yield or stop as they might enter the street.\n\nMultiple yellow traffic cones with reflective strips are arranged in a row, marking one side of the road near pedestrians and the central median strip. These cones could denote a workspace or a warning area, thus reducing available lanes and guiding the traffic flow.\n\nA green metal barrier is placed to the right of our vehicle on the sidewalk, designating an area where pedestrians cannot cross. This barrier implies a reduced risk of pedestrian intrusion onto the street, thereby enhancing safety.\n\nAdditionally, external obstructions such as raindrops, snowflakes, or dirt spots on the windshield may impair visibility, necessitating the use of wipers and extra caution."

    "driving_suggestion": "This vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead due to the dense traffic and potential stop-and-go situations that require preparedness for stopping or slowing down. Caution should be exercised when passing traffic cones, keeping a safe distance to avoid areas that may be obstructed. Moreover, given the wet road conditions, this vehicle should reduce speed and remain vigilant for unpredictable behaviors from other road users, especially at the upcoming intersection. Checking rearview mirrors and blind spots is indispensable before making lane changes or turning maneuvers. The presence of traffic cones suggests potential hazards or construction zones; therefore, the vehicle should avoid them and anticipate possible reductions in lane availability. Finally, this vehicle should activate the windshield wipers to ensure clear visibility, and may need to reduce speed to compensate for the potentially reduced traction on wet road surfaces.",
