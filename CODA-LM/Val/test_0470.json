Its visibility is somewhat compromised due to the dim lighting conditions. This situation necessitates caution as, although the vehicle is currently stationary, there exists a potential risk that it might start moving unexpectedly. Should this occur, it would transform into a moving obstacle, thereby affecting the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating sudden maneuvers or adjustments to maintain safety. The absence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects in the image indicates that these elements do not play a role in the current traffic scenario being analyzed."

    "driving_suggestion": "When driving, the use of headlights is essential to improve visibility and alertness. Hazard warning lights, if fitted, may also be utilized to notify oncoming traffic in both directions. Extreme caution is necessary due to poor visibility, the potential for sudden movements by pedestrians, or other unexpected obstacles that may appear on the road. Extra care must be taken when passing parked vehicles on the left, being prepared for the possibility they may pull into the traffic flow. Additionally, adjust speed to accommodate potentially slippery road conditions and increase the following distance to ensure a safe stopping gap. Due to low visibility, drivers should slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Headlights should be used appropriately to ensure pedestrians are aware of the vehicle's presence. Drivers must also remain highly vigilant for other road users who may be difficult to detect due to poor lighting conditions.",
