The headlights of these vehicles are visible, which helps to indicate their presence. However, the headlights do not provide enough information to determine whether the vehicles are stationary or in motion, necessitating extra caution while driving.\n\nAdditionally, the overall visibility in the environment is compromised due to poor lighting and potential obstructions such as fog, smoke, or dust. This low visibility could significantly impair the vehicle's ability to detect and respond to other road users and obstacles in a timely manner. As a result, it is advised to reduce speed and enhance vigilance to ensure safety. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image. However, the presence of other objects that contribute to the low visibility is noted, emphasizing the need for careful driving in such conditions."
