However, the scene does include other objects; specifically, large spools of cable and additional construction-related materials are present off the roadway to the right, securely positioned behind a fence. Although these objects are not directly obstructing the road, their existence indicates that there might be recent or ongoing construction activity in the vicinity. It is important for the autonomous vehicle, or ego car, to take cognizance of this situation as it could mean construction traffic might be entering or exiting the worksite possibly affecting the normal flow of traffic."

In this scenario, since it is placed by the side of the road and does not pose an immediate obstacle to the roadway, it should not significantly influence the future driving behavior of the car. The ego car would continue on its path without need for action related to this object.",

They are stored outside, likely on a business property adjacent to the road. These objects do not have a direct influence on the future driving behavior of the ego vehicle, as they are stationary and located off the roadway. As long as these objects remain in this position, the driver of the ego vehicle has no immediate need to adjust driving behavior. However, caution should be taken to ensure that these large objects do not pose a hazard if they were to somehow roll onto the road.",
