        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a green taxi that has come to a halt directly at the crossroads in front of our car, indicating the probable presence of a traffic control device such as a red light, which calls for our vehicle to stop as well. On the left side, a large cement mixer truck is detected, occupying the adjacent lane and moving forward. This behemoth is of concern due to its potential to obscure vision and if it changes lanes, this could introduce a merging hazard. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles on the opposite side of the road; however, they aren't currently affecting the driving decisions of our vehicle, as they are separated by a median.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, a motorcyclist is observed crossing the intersection ahead and moving towards the right, which is vital to monitor to prevent conflicts if the car turns. Moreover, a pedestrian crossing sign is spotted on the right side, heralding a crosswalk and thereby signaling the need for additional caution in anticipation of pedestrian activity.\n\nRegarding the traffic signs, the aforementioned pedestrian crosswalk sign emphasizes the potential presence of pedestrians and the necessity of vigilance to ensure their safety and to adhere to traffic laws.\n\nAs for the traffic light, it is currently red, indicating that vehicles, including autonomous ones like ours, must stop at the intersection and wait for it to change to green before proceeding.\n\nOther objects in the scene include an electronic display board overhead with text that is not straightforwardly understood, but it does not presently influence driving decisions. Nonetheless, its presence is noted for its potential to convey critical traffic updates.\n\nThe scene does not feature any traffic cones or barriers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should stop behind the green taxi, observe its brake lights and the traffic signal lights above, which are not visible in the picture. You should wait for a green light or for the taxi to start moving before proceeding. Maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer to better ensure visibility and be ready to respond to the actions of other road users. Monitor the motorcyclist to ensure they safely pass through the intersection before proceeding. Watch for pedestrians who may use the crosswalk. Keep a safe following distance, be prepared to stop at a red light, and continue to watch for when the traffic light turns green.",
