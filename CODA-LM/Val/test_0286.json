        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are multiple vehicles, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers that are relevant for safe autonomous navigation.\n\nVehicles:\n1. There is a white sedan moving in the same direction as our vehicle, occupying the right lane at a moderate distance ahead. The speed and direction of this sedan are critical, as it is crucial to maintain a safe following distance and to be ready to react to any unforeseen changes in its behavior.\n2. Further ahead in the right lane, there is a white hatchback also traveling in the same direction as our car. The relative position of this hatchback is important to monitor in case a lane change by either vehicle becomes necessary or if the hatchback performs unexpected maneuvers.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. There is a blue highway information sign on the right that displays directional arrows, providing information on the lane distribution ahead and the directions to different destinations. Recognizing these signs is important to plan any necessary lane changes well in advance.\n2. Additionally, a circular no parking sign on the right side of the road indicates a no parking zone. It is essential for autonomous vehicles to observe this sign to avoid parking in this section of the road.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n1. Orange traffic cones are set up to the left of the right lane, starting to direct the flow of traffic outside a designated section of the road, likely due to a closure or construction work. These cones alert the driver to remain in the current lane and pay attention to the possibility of nearby workers or equipment.\n\nBarriers:\n1. A metal guardrail is present behind the traffic cones on the right side of the road. While guardrails don't directly affect driving decisions, they serve an essential function in delineating the boundaries of the road to contain vehicles within the drivable space.\n2. On the left side near the highway entrance, a guardrail is followed by red and white traffic barriers, with an extended section ahead sectioned off by traffic cones. These features demarcate the safe driving area, making it necessary for vehicles to keep to the left and avoid the areas marked for no access."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, be mindful of traffic merging from the right due to the highway entrance, and prepare for the traffic conditions that might arise from an upcoming roundabout. Stay alert to any changes caused by the placement of traffic cones and safely pass through this section according to the road markings. Since there are obstructions indicating that the adjacent area is not suitable for driving, stay in your current lane. Keep your lane while adjusting your speed to match that of the vehicle in front of you. If road signs indicate a split in the direction of travel, be ready to change lanes. Watch for traffic cones and avoid any potential roadworks or obstacles on the right. Follow road signs, and there should be no stopping in this section.",
