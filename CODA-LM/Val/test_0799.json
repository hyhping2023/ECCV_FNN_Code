        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, various road users and elements are present. To begin with, there is a line of cars parked neatly on the left side of the road. The collection includes different colors and models, and they all appear to be stationary. These parked vehicles narrow the usable width of the lanes, creating a potential hazard: if one were to pull out unexpectedly, it could disrupt the flow of moving traffic and possibly lead to an accident.\n\nAdding to the road's complexity, there are yellow traffic cones set out on the roadway further ahead, forming a linear path that directs traffic to veer left. These cones typically signify the presence of construction or some on-road hazard, necessitating a shift in the driving path to maintain safety and traffic flow.\n\nIn terms of road separation, white fences are installed along both sides of the road, creating a clear division between the pedestrian space and the vehicle lanes. The purpose of this median strip is to provide an organized road space, ensuring that pedestrians are kept at a safe distance from vehicular traffic.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists. Additionally, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects that might influence driving behavior or traffic conditions in the scenario described."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should slow down and follow the detour route as indicated by traffic cones, making a left turn to avoid the area marked closed by barriers. Due to parked vehicles that may limit visibility and road space, driving cautiously is required. Maintain a safe speed, being ready to respond to pedestrians or other obstructions that may suddenly appear. As you proceed, stay in your current lane, keeping a safe distance from parked cars and barriers on the right to avoid any unforeseen obstacles or road users. Maintain an appropriate speed to react to unexpected situations such as workers or equipment that might suddenly appear in work areas. Moreover, be alert for any upcoming traffic controls or signs. Due to lane restrictions caused by barriers, your vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to merge left when the right lane is blocked, while staying alert for any temporary traffic signals or directions from road workers. Do not attempt any aggressive driving maneuvers, and it is advised to keep a safe distance from other road users who are navigating the same obstacles.",
