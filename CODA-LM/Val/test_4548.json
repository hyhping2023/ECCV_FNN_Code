The presence of these larger, slower vehicles indicates that the ego car may need to adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain a safe following distance and ensure a clear path forward.\n\nOverhead, there are directional signs across the highway that provide lane designations for different routes. These signs are important for the ego vehicle to understand upcoming exits or necessary lane changes depending on the intended route.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are placed on the left edge of the right lane, signaling the start of a lane merge. The ego car must merge left if it is in the right lane or be cautious of other vehicles that may merge into its lane due to these lane restrictions.\n\nConcrete barriers are also present, separating the oncoming traffic lanes from the lanes going in the direction of the ego vehicle. These barriers are crucial as they dictate the designated driving paths and ensure the separation of opposing traffic flows, contributing to the safety of the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."

Continue to monitor for any unexpected obstacles or changes in road conditions. Keep in the current lane if clear and monitor for any vehicles entering from the right."
