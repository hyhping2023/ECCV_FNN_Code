The driver should be cautious of the parked car as it might pull into traffic. Monitoring the dog's movement is crucial, and the driver should be ready to brake or take evasive maneuvers to ensure the safety of all road users. Reduce speed and prepare to stop if necessary to avoid the animal on the road. Be observant for any other unpredictable actions from the parked car or possible pedestrians that could emerge from blind spots, such as from behind buildings or parked vehicles. No immediate action required for the parked vehicle on the right side of the road, but maintain awareness in case it becomes a mobile hazard. Additionally, it should cautiously navigate around the parked vehicle while being aware of the potential of oncoming traffic due to the narrow road. If visibility is low or there is oncoming traffic, turning on the vehicle's headlights (if not already on) and using the horn gently to alert the animal may be advisable."
