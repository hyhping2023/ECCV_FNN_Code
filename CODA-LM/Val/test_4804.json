        "description and explanation": "The image shows a road scenario with several vehicles and a vulnerable road user. A silver sedan is parked on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of our autonomous vehicle's position. There are no apparent occupants or activity around the sedan. Although the parked sedan does not pose an immediate dynamic threat, it does narrow the usable road width. Therefore, it requires careful monitoring in case of doors opening or pedestrians moving around it.\n\nIn addition to the sedan, there are various other cars parked along the right side of the road. These parked cars further narrow the path for moving traffic without obstructing the lane. The density of parked cars may obscure pedestrians stepping onto the road and restrict maneuvering space. This situation requires attentiveness and reduced speed from our autonomous vehicle.\n\nA small dog is also visible on the right side of the road, close to the parked cars and directly in the path of our autonomous vehicle. Animals are unpredictable and may enter the road, which requires our autonomous vehicle to slow down and be prepared to stop, ensuring the safety of all road users.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image."

While cats are unpredictable and could potentially dart into the road, the current distance between the cat and the vehicle likely allows the driver sufficient time to react should the cat move onto the roadway. The presence of the cat should prompt the driver to proceed cautiously and be prepared to brake or steer away to prevent a collision.",

The ego car needs to be aware of the potential for the dog to move unpredictably. Additionally, given the density of parked cars, the ego vehicle should exercise caution and be prepared for obscured pedestrians. Maintaining a low speed in this populated area and staying alert for any sudden changes in the environment is advised."
