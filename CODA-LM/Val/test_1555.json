        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are parked sedans on the right side of the road, though their colors are indistinct due to low lighting. These stationary vehicles reduce the usable width of the driving lane but do not pose an immediate dynamic threat. There are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, so no immediate action is required, although caution is advised for any that might suddenly appear from behind parked vehicles or off-road areas. Additionally, no traffic signs are visible because of the low visibility conditions, so the ego car should follow default road rules and proceed cautiously. There are no visible traffic lights, which means the ego car should not expect to approach any traffic light-controlled intersections imminently. Orange traffic cones line the right side of the road, forming a pathway and indicating a section of the road or potential hazard is blocked off, possibly due to road work or temporary obstructions, guiding where the ego car should drive. A reflective construction barrier is also present on the right side of the road past the parked cars, suggesting a potential narrowing or blockage in the driving path ahead. Lastly, due to the low visibility conditions, no other discernible objects are noticeable, warranting extra caution to avoid hidden hazards."

Prepare for potential maneuvering around the area marked off by the traffic cones while respecting any road work or obstructions. Utilize the vehicle's lights to improve visibility and alertness of the ego car's presence to other road users."
