        "description and explanation": "The scene depicted includes a variety of road users and signs impacting navigation decisions. We have several vehicles: There’s a large truck to the right ahead with rear signal lights active, suggesting a stop or slow movement. Its presence could obscure the lane and visibility, so our vehicle may need to slow or merge left. There’s also a small vehicle to the left, moving in the same direction; maintaining a safe distance here is crucial. A white car in the same lane ahead seems to be moving slowly or has stopped, possibly due to an obstacle, so following at a safe distance will be necessary. Additionally, an oncoming car in the opposite lane must be monitored for safe distance maintenance.\n\nNo vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists are present in this image.\n\nFor traffic signs, there is a directional arrow sign behind the large truck, pointing left, possibly indicating a detour or lane merge that drivers should be ready to follow.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in the image.\n\nMeanwhile, traffic cones and barriers are set up in the center of the road, signaling that there is a lane merge or construction ahead. This requires drivers to slow down and be more alert for safe merging.\n\nThe barriers present are roadblocks and traffic cones, enhancing the marking of the lane merge or construction areas, emphasizing the need for lane changes and cautious driving.\n\nNo other objects like debris or dustbins are mentioned in the reported scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the obstruction caused by stationary or slow-moving trucks on the lane, our vehicle should slow down and be prepared to merge left when necessary. Especially in conditions of reduced visibility at night, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead on the left is also important. Continuously monitoring the situation as new information emerges, such as traffic signs or brake lights from vehicles ahead, is crucial. Our vehicle should handle this situation with caution, slowing down due to nearby trucks and potential parallel traffic. Maintain a safe following distance behind the white vehicle, stay alert to traffic lights in case of changes, and be ready to merge into a single lane as directed by traffic cones and obstacle markers. Continue to monitor oncoming traffic, particularly yellow vehicles, as they may pose a risk if they deviate from their lane.",
