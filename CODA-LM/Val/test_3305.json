The presence of the car right next to the ego car restricts the ability to change lanes or avoid other obstacles."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles present. The first is a large commercial truck positioned ahead to the left of the ego vehicle. It has reflective markings and illuminated rear lights, suggesting nighttime driving conditions. The truck's considerable size and location partially block the driving lane of the ego vehicle and may indicate that it is moving slower than smaller vehicles. Due to its oversize and potential heavy load, the truck may have limited maneuverability and could make sudden stops, affecting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle.\n\nThe second vehicle is a passenger car situated to the right and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, with its brake lights on. This indicates that the car may be slowing down or in stop-and-go traffic, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintain a safe following distance. The car's proximity to the ego vehicle limits the options for lane changes or avoiding obstacles.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

It typically has a strong chassis, robust tires, and may include specific machinery for construction tasks. The presence of such a vehicle indicates that there may be roadwork or a construction zone ahead.

Trucks are used to transport goods and materials over both short and long distances. Due to their size and weight, trucks have longer stopping distances and may require more room for maneuvers. The ego car should account for this by giving the truck ample space, especially in situations that might require sudden stops or turns.",

Use low-beam headlights to avoid dazzling other drivers and enhance visibility. Stay alert for any potential merging vehicles or changes in traffic flow. Avoid sudden lane changes due to the close proximity of the car on the right. Stay vigilant for any brake lights or signals from the vehicles ahead and be prepared to respond accordingly. The ego car should also be ready for maneuvering if necessary, observing the sedan's movements to avoid any sudden lateral shifts from other drivers. Monitoring the rear-view mirror for oncoming traffic is also important as visibility is compromised."
