This situation may lead to other vehicles needing to merge into the ego vehicle's lane to circumvent the parked car, thereby necessitating that the ego vehicle be vigilant for potential merging traffic.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian with a dog on a leash is seen crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle. This represents an immediate risk, as they are in the direct path of the ego vehicle, and it will need to either stop or slow down to ensure their safety.\n\nMoreover, spherical barriers, or bollards, are placed on the side of the road, demarcating the separation between the pedestrian area and the roadway. These barriers serve both to outline the limits of the drivable area and to prevent vehicles from inadvertently entering pedestrian spaces, acting as a safeguard.\n\nAnother set of objects observed are roadside bollards, similar in appearance to the earlier mentioned barriers, lining the curb along the side of the road. These spherical-shaped bollards act as a demarcation separating the pedestrian zone from the vehicular traffic area, and itâ€™s important for the ego vehicle to maintain an adequate distance from them to navigate safely.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this image, which suggests that these elements do not impact the driving conditions for the ego vehicle in the immediate scene."
