There is also oncoming traffic in the opposite lane, necessitating the self-driving vehicle to remain on its designated side of the road and to be prepared for any unforeseen actions from the oncoming vehicles. \n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians present on both sides of the street, with some particularly close to the edge of the road. This calls for the autonomous vehicle to slow down and be more vigilant as pedestrians could step onto the road, potentially leading to an accident. \n\nA \"No Parking\" sign is visible on the right side, indicating that vehicles are not allowed to park or stop along that stretch of the road, influencing the parking behaviors of vehicles in the area.\n\nLastly, while the lanes themselves are clear, there is snow piled up beside the road. This suggests recent or upcoming challenging driving conditions due to weather, but does not directly impede the autonomous vehicle's path. Other categories such as traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not contain any elements in this particular scenario and are therefore not included in the summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "If you see pedestrians indicating their intention to cross the road, be prepared to slow down or stop. Pay attention to the green tricycles, and make sure to overtake them cautiously when it is safe to do so. Observe all marked traffic signs, including \"No Parking\" zones. Drive carefully due to the presence of pedestrians on the side of the road and potential icy road conditions. Maintain a safe distance from cars and motorized tricycles parked on the right side, and be prepared to stop or evade if pedestrians enter the roadway. Carefully pass stationary vehicles on the right, ensuring safety and the absence of oncoming traffic. This vehicle should keep a safe distance from the green tricycle ahead, be ready to slow down for pedestrians who may cross the road, and overtake cyclists with a safe margin. Besides refraining from parking in \"No Parking\" areas, there are no immediate parking restrictions affecting the driving path. Continue to monitor any changes in traffic or road conditions on the road.",
