        "description and explanation": "In the scene, there is a large yellow construction vehicle loaded onto a flatbed trailer, which is part of a heavy hauler truck. This truck is positioned in the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car, and due to its size, it may be slightly intruding on an adjacent lane. The size and slower speed of the truck are likely influencing the flow of traffic, requiring the ego car to possibly change lanes or adjust speed to maintain safety and account for the likelihood of needing to overtake the truck.\n\nSeveral cars are also observed in the distance, traveling in the left lane in the same direction as the ego car. This indicates a steady flow of traffic that the ego car should consider to ensure appropriate driving behavior within the current traffic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, a silver sedan is driving in the left lane, parallel to the ego car. The ego car must take into account the speed and proximity of this sedan to maintain lane safety and prevent any potential side collisions.\n\nFurthermore, there are white vehicles in the lanes designated for oncoming traffic. While they are separated by a median and don't directly affect the ego car's current lane discipline or immediate maneuvers, general awareness of oncoming traffic is still necessary, especially for any forthcoming lane changes or turns.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is an unlit blank billboard which does not provide any pertinent information that would affect the ego car's driving decisions, as it does not offer any directions or warnings to be noted.\n\nTraffic lights are also present; however, their signals cannot be discerned from the image. This means the ego car must approach the intersection with caution, ready to adapt to the light's actual signal, which could affect the right of way and the need to stop or proceed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the scene that would require additional consideration from the ego car."

It may consider changing lanes to the left if the truck is moving significantly slower than the flow of traffic and it is safe to do so. Maintain a safe distance behind the truck carrying the construction vehicle, being prepared to adjust lane position if necessary due to the potential overhang of the construction vehicle. Approach the traffic lights with caution, being ready to respond appropriately to their signal. Monitor the blank billboard in case it becomes lit with relevant traffic information. Monitor the speed and trajectory of the silver sedan to its left, and should be prepared to overtake the construction vehicle if it is moving significantly slower than the flow of traffic, while ensuring it is safe to merge into the left lane. It's also advised to continue monitoring the surroundings for any changes in traffic conditions or signals that may affect driving behavior."
