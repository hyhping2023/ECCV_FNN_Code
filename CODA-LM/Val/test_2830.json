Maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, monitor the speeds of surrounding vehicles, and prepare to change lanes to the left if necessary to avoid the obstructed right lane due to the traffic cones. Continue to monitor the surroundings for any changes, such as additional traffic cones, barriers, or road work ahead that may require further adjustments in driving behavior."
