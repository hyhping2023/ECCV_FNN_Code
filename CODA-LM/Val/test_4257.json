This truck needs to be monitored to ensure safe passage through the intersection.\n   - A white sedan is positioned in the left-turn lane at the intersection, likely waiting to make a turn when the traffic light allows. Its movements should be observed as it may affect the vehicle's driving trajectory based on signal changes and right-of-way.\n   - A red truck is approaching the intersection from a distance on the left; it is unlikely to immediately affect driving decisions, but its presence should be noted to avoid potential collisions when entering the intersection.\n   - Several vehicles are scattered in the distance behind the concrete mixer truck across both straight and turning lanes, and their movements need to be monitored as they could impact the traffic dynamics at the intersection.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light in this lane displays a red light for proceeding straight and a green arrow for turning left, indicating that the vehicle can turn left but cannot go straight. The vehicle should turn left cautiously and pay attention to the movements of other vehicles.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects were identified in this particular traffic image."

Given the current status of the traffic lights, our vehicle should not proceed straight and should be prepared to stop at any time. Due to the indication of the green left-turn arrow, making a turn is permissible. Also, pay attention to other vehicles that may be approaching the intersection from a distance.",
