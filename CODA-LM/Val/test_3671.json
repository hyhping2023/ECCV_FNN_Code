The vehicle is relatively large, possibly a heavy equipment vehicle, and occupies most of the lane width. Brake lights illuminated indicating it is either slowing down or stopped.",
                "explanation": "The presence of this construction vehicle directly ahead influences the ego car's driving behavior, requiring the ego car to either follow at a safe distance or change lanes to overtake if safe to do so. The illuminated brake lights suggest that the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down."

The ego car must keep a safe distance and prepare for adjustments such as following at a safer distance or changing lanes to navigate around the construction vehicle.\n\nTo the left of the ego car is a white taxi, traveling in the same direction in an adjacent lane. The ego car should be aware of this taxi when contemplating lane changes or maneuvers to pass the construction vehicle, ensuring safe lateral movement.\n\nThere is also a red car to the right of the ego car, moving in a parallel lane and partially sitting in the blind spot. The ego car should monitor this vehicle closely for any unexpected lane changes that might influence the ego car's movement.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic lights visible ahead with red signals instructing vehicles to stop. The ego car's behavior will be affected by the need to obey the traffic light and come to a complete stop, which will influence the flow of traffic and subsequent driving decisions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data for the current traffic scene."

If the ego car is not already slowing down or stopped, applying the brakes gently to come to a safe stop is advised, while keeping an eye on the rearview mirror for traffic from behind. Lane changes should be considered with caution due to the presence of the white car in the adjacent lane. Finally, the ego car should observe the traffic light and prepare to stop if it is approaching an intersection where the red light is applicable to its direction of travel."
