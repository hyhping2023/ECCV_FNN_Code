        "description and explanation": "The traffic image viewed shows a large cement truck on the right side of the ego vehicle. The truck is partially visible with its mixing drum and rear wheels in sight. It appears to be stationary or moving very slowly and displays a safety warning sign on its machinery. The proximity of the truck, along with its size, is a concern for the autonomous system; it could potentially start moving unexpectedly or cause reduced visibility on the ego vehicle's right side which could affect driving behavior. Additionally, there is a white fence-like barrier situated behind the cement mixer truck that marks the boundary of the road. This barrier is relevant as it indicates that there is limited road space and acts as a navigation guide within this constrained area. There are no other road users such as vulnerable users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

The large rotating drum, which is partially enclosed by a structure designed to guide the concrete mix, is visible on the back of the truck. This type of vehicle transports premixed concrete to construction sites. As these trucks are heavy and often slow-moving when fully loaded, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be cautious when considering overtaking, as the truck's size may obstruct the view of oncoming traffic.",

Be prepared to stop or yield if the truck begins to maneuver. Proceed with caution and at a speed that allows for safe reaction time to any potential hazards that may arise from the truck's movements. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the truck's signals and movement carefully, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, provided it can be done so safely. Checking the side mirrors and blind spots before any lane change is crucial. Moreover, the driver should be aware of the road boundaries marked by the barrier and stay within lane markings to avoid accidents."
