Directly ahead in the same lane is a yellow truck displaying red taillights, which suggests it may be slowing down or has come to a stop. This necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and is prepared to stop if needed.\n\nAccompanying the scene are several other vehicles visible by their rear lights, traveling in the same direction ahead of the ego car. These vehicles dictate the flow of traffic, signaling to the ego car the importance of keeping a safe distance to allow for reaction to any sudden changes in speed.\n\nOverhead signs also communicate crucial information to the driving system. Two yellow warning signs indicate an upcoming cross junction and another alerting to merging traffic from the right, prompting heightened caution due to the potential for cross traffic and new vehicles entering the ego car's path which could necessitate adjustments in driving.\n\nAt the intersection lies a traffic light which is currently red, commanding the ego car to come to a complete stop. \n\nLastly, there are environmental conditions such as possible reflections and glare from the wet road surface and other vehicles' lights. These can impair the visibility for the sensors and cameras on the autonomous vehicle, and therefore, the system must be prepared to adapt and remain vigilant to address sudden changes in visibility."
