        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene ahead, there is a concrete mixer truck directly ahead of the ego car, occupying the same lane. It is large, with a visible license plate, and appears to be stationary or moving slowly, indicated by the illuminated brake lights. The size and position of the truck may obstruct the ego car's view and limit its maneuverability. Its slow movement or potential stoppage requires the ego car to maintain a careful following distance and be prepared to stop.\n\nOn the left lane, a sedan is parallel to the ego car, also appearing to move slowly or is stationary, which is evident by the visible brake lights. The close proximity of this sedan could affect the ego car's ability to safely change lanes to the left.\n\nTo the right of the road, a small three-wheeled vehicle is noticeable by its exposed rider and distinct red color. It is important for the ego car to keep additional distance from this small and potentially less stable vehicle, which could make erratic movements.\n\nThere is a compact white-colored vehicle in the opposite lane, driving away from the ego car, which does not immediately affect the ego car but should be noted for general situational awareness.\n\nAlongside the white car, a three-wheeled vehicle, resembling a motorized rickshaw, is also in the opposite lane and driving away. It has no direct impact on the ego car's immediate driving decisions, except for the unlikely event of it swerving into the ego car's lane.\n\nAbove the road, ahead of the construction vehicle, a traffic light is mounted, displaying a red signal. It informs that the ego car and all other traffic must stop and wait for the light to change to green before they can proceed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in this scene."

Avoid changing lanes to the left unless the sedan has moved ahead and a safe gap is available, as the truck's large size may obscure any potential hazards in the lane-change area. Remain vigilant and monitor the behavior of the oncoming traffic for any sudden or unexpected maneuvers that could affect the current flow of traffic. Given the current traffic situation, the ego vehicle should also remain observant of the vehicles in adjacent lanes, particularly the silver sedan on the left which may affect lateral maneuvering options and the three-wheeled vehicle on the right for potential unpredictable movements. It is essential to follow the traffic light instructions and remain cautious until it is safe to proceed."
