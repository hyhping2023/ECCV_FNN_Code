A white car is in the lane next to the ego car, moving in the same direction with its brake lights on, indicating it may be slowing down or preparing to park. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to navigate around the vehicle.\n2. Ahead of the ego car, there are multiple vehicles with illuminated brake lights, signaling that traffic is slow-moving or stopped. The ego car must be prepared to decelerate or come to a halt.\n3. There is a vehicle with bright lights facing the ego car, which could be part of a traffic stop or checkpoint. The ego car should approach this situation cautiously.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. Pedestrians, including a vendor with a stall, are on the right side of the road, indicating potential pedestrian activity near the driving lanes. The ego car must monitor this area closely and be prepared to slow down or stop for pedestrians who may enter the driving path unexpectedly.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. The traffic light's state is unclear due to glare in the image. The ego car should approach the intersection with caution and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. Glare and light reflections from street lights and vehicle headlights are present in the image, which can obscure vision and reduce the ability to detect road users and objects. This requires the ego car to reduce speed and increase alertness.\n2. Street vendors are on the right, which could lead to distractions and unexpected pedestrian movements. The ego car needs to exercise caution in this area.\n\nThe traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers categories do not contain any items in this image and are therefore not considered in the driving scenario."

Additionally, the ego car should utilize other sensors, like radar or LIDAR, to compensate for the limited camera visibility. The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, maintain a lower speed to react to potential pedestrian movement or the need to stop due to the traffic ahead, and avoid the left lane if possible to stay clear from the white car. Enhanced vigilance is recommended due to the visibility issues caused by the glare, combined with the activity on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle's sensor systems should be checked to ensure they're functioning correctly despite the difficult lighting conditions. The ego car should reduce speed due to the reflective, possibly wet road conditions. It should keep a safe distance from the white car on the left, which may be stopping or parked, and prepare for maneuvers around it if needed. The vehicle facing the ego car should be approached with caution, as it could be part of a traffic stop or unusual traffic situation. Extra attention should be paid to the pedestrians on the right to ensure they do not enter the roadway. Overall, the ego vehicle should be ready to stop or maneuver carefully if any unpredictable actions occur from other road users."
