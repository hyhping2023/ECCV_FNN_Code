        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles and a set of traffic lights that are relevant to the ego vehicle's driving decisions. Firstly, there is a white van positioned on the left side of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead, with its right indicator on. This suggests that the van may be intending to change lanes or turn right shortly. The presence of the van requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the van's potential lane change, which could affect the ego vehicle's path.\n\nSecondly, directly ahead of the ego vehicle, in the same lane, there is a flatbed truck carrying a yellow excavator. The size of the truck and its load may limit the ego vehicle's visibility of the road ahead and the truck could make sudden stops or turns. Therefore, the ego vehicle should ensure there is sufficient following distance to anticipate any abrupt movements or slow traffic flow caused by the truck.\n\nLastly, the traffic lights in the scene are located in the top left corner; however, they are not displaying any identifiable color at the moment. This requires the ego vehicle to approach the intersection with caution, being ready to stop or proceed based on the traffic lights' changes or the actions of other road users.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
