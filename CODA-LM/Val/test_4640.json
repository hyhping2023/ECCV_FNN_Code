The spool is composed of two flanges connected by a cylinder. In this driving scenario, the cable spool is located off the roadway and should not affect the driving behavior of the ego car directly. However, as it is an object near the road, the driver should be aware of the surroundings for any unexpected obstructions or movements, such as if the spool were to roll onto the roadway.",
