        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, we observe a white truck parked on the right side of the road with its tail lights on, which suggests that it might be stationary due to a breakdown, delivery, or other issues. Therefore, the autonomous vehicle should keep a safe distance and be ready to stop or steer around the truck if it protrudes into the driving lane. Additionally, a number of traffic cones have been placed to create a new pathway nudging to the left, likely indicating a construction zone or an obstruction ahead. It's imperative for the autonomous vehicle to adhere to this new path for safety reasons and to comply with the traffic rules. Furthermore, there is a barrier wall positioned to the right of the cones along the road, which narrows the drivable space and prevents the autonomous vehicle from moving too far right to circumvent the truck. This requires the vehicle to slow down and enhance its level of caution while proceeding. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that need to be considered."
