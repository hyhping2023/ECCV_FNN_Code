To the right side of the road, there is a yellow directional sign indicating ETC lanes with an arrow pointing downwards to the right. This sign suggests that the ego car should move into the correct lane for electronic toll collection if it is equipped for such systems. Along the left edge of the designated lane and on the sides of toll booths, there are multiple yellow and orange traffic cones. These cones act as temporary barriers guiding traffic and preventing the ego car from entering restricted areas like closed toll booths or construction zones.\n\nAdditionally, a blue metallic barrier is visible beyond the traffic cones on the right side. This barrier likely designates an area restricted for maintenance or other activities, suggesting that vehicles, including the ego car, should avoid this zone. Finally, there is minor debris, possibly from a tire or similar object, located on the right edge of the road. While this debris does not obstruct the ego car's path, it should be monitored for potential hazards to other road users."
