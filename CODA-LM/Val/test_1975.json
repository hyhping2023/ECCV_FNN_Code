A large yellow maintenance vehicle is positioned directly in front of the ego car, its considerable size and potential stationary status while performing road work makes it a significant obstacle, obligating the ego car to potentially slow down or change lanes. Also in this vicinity are several cars in the left lane, including one black car ahead in the same lane as the maintenance vehicle. Due to the close proximity of these vehicles, the ego car must remain vigilant to react to any potential maneuvers such as sudden lane changes or braking from these other vehicles.\n\nOn the side of the road, there are bicycles parked which suggest the possible presence of cyclists, necessitating cautious monitoring by the ego car for any individuals who may approach the road to retrieve their bicycles.\n\nWhile there are no traffic signs or physical barriers impacting the ego car's immediate driving decisions, the absence of traffic lights instructs the ego car to continue following default traffic rules and prioritize right-of-way accordingly.\n\nSurrounding the maintenance vehicle, a series of orange traffic cones delineate a work zone. These traffic cones are critical for directing the flow of traffic, indicating areas that are temporarily inaccessible and requiring the ego car to adjust its course.\n\nAn additional factor is the glare from the sun which may impede the visibility of the ego car's sensors or possibly the driver if the car is being manually operated. This glare necessitates increased caution due to the potential difficulty in detecting traffic signals, road signs, and other road users."

If the maintenance vehicle is moving slowly or is stationary, it may be wise to consider a safe lane change to the left if the way is clear and traffic conditions permit. Monitor surroundings for any vehicles that may change lanes or enter the path of the ego car. Approach the parked bicycles with caution and watch for any cyclists. Due to the traffic cones, stay in the current lane but be prepared to navigate away from the work zone while maintaining lane discipline. Adjust driving speed to accommodate the possibly wet road conditions and increase alertness due to reduced visibility from sun glare. If the vehicle has autonomous capabilities, ensure that all sensors are functioning correctly and compensate for any sensor impairment due to glare."
