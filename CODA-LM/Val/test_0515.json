        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene under observation, there is a single SUV directly ahead on the road, which has its tail lights on and is positioned at an angle, suggesting it might be parked or stopped suddenly. The positioning of the SUV serves as a potential hazard that necessitates our vehicle to either decelerate or halt to evaluate the situation safely.\n\nOn the right side of the SUV, there is a cyclist. This individual is outfitted with reflective gear which could indicate they are using a bicycle or are equipped with delivery apparatus. As they are considered a vulnerable road user, the autonomous vehicle must ensure to provide sufficient clearance, proceed with caution when passing, and be prepared to stop or slow down near the SUV to prioritize the cyclistâ€™s safety.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow traffic sign with black stripes is visible, albeit partially, on the right sidewalk. The obscured nature of this sign means that its full message is not clear, but it suggests that it might be a warning or indicate roadwork nearby. Due to this uncertainty, extra caution should be taken while driving past this sign."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, maintain a low speed, and be prepared to stop at any time. When overtaking, ensure there is no oncoming traffic and that the maneuver is safe and legal. Leave ample space when passing cyclists. Be alert to road conditions that may pose hazards. If possible and safe, consider changing lanes to go around obstacles such as SUVs, using turn signals to indicate your intentions to other road users. The vehicle you are driving should be vigilant for individuals who may appear from behind or around the vehicle, as visibility is limited at night. If there is not enough space to safely go around, you should stop and wait for the road to clear.",
