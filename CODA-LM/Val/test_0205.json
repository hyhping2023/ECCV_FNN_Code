There's also oncoming traffic in the opposite lanes that could result in unexpected maneuvers requiring vigilance. A blue car is noticed in motion in the leftmost lane in the same direction as the ego car, affecting potential lane choices or speed adjustments. A motorcycle is spotted driving down the center of the rightmost lane, which calls for increased attentiveness given the smaller size and agility of motorcycles that could lead to unpredictability.\n\nFor non-vehicular road users, there are pedestrians observed on the sidewalks on both sides of the street. The presence of pedestrians requires that the ego vehicle be prepared to yield or come to a stop if they enter the roadway.\n\nIn terms of traffic infrastructure, various commercial and shop signs are prominent along the road, but no regulatory traffic signs are visible in the image. Consequently, the ego car must adhere to the standard road rules of the local jurisdiction. No traffic lights or barriers are present in this captured image.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lone traffic cone positioned on the right edge of the road near the parked vehicles. It could be a marker for potential hazards or roadwork, and it demands that the ego car stay watchful for unexpected changes or obstacles in the roadway. Finally, stationary elements like trees and light poles line the right-hand sidewalk, which may hinder visibility and should be considered if the ego car navigates near the roadside."

Additionally, the ego car should stay vigilant for changes in road conditions or traffic signs and signals not currently visible."
