        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several notable road users categorized under vehicles, vulnerable road users, and traffic lights.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a white sedan situated on the right side of the road. It has its hazard lights on and the trunk open, positioned slightly diagonally, likely indicating an emergency or a breakdown. This vehicle is considered a potential hazard as it may obstruct part of the road, potentially causing unexpected maneuvers from other road users. Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked on both sides of the road, leading to a narrow pathway which limits the maneuverability for the ego car and might conceal other road users who could be crossing between them. Moreover, several cars are parked along the side of the road while a couple of vehicles, with their headlights on and facing the ego car, suggest the presence of oncoming traffic. The parked cars further narrow the navigable road space, demanding cautious navigation by both the ego car and the oncoming traffic to avert any collisions.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, pedestrians are observed on both the left and right sides of the image, walking close to the parked vehicles. Some are in dark clothing, rendering them less visible at night. Pedestrians located close to the vehicle's travel path present a significant safety concern, especially during nighttime when visibility is limited, increasing the risk of jaywalking or unexpected pedestrian movements onto the road.\n\nLastly, within the traffic lights category, there's a traffic light in the background emitting a green glow. This indicates that it's currently showing a green signal, implying that the ego car can proceed, provided the path is clear of any other hazards or road users.\n\nNo notable objects were reported in the categories of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects."
