This parked vehicle may pose a risk since unforeseen movements such as people entering or exiting the vehicle could occur suddenly. Additionally, there are yellow-orange traffic cones aligned on the right side, positioned just ahead of the parked white car. These cones indicate there might be a construction zone or a temporary change in the road layout, warranting cautious driving and potentially necessitating a change in the driving lane. Finally, there is a group of wheeled bins located next to the traffic cones on the right. The placement of these bins suggests there might be maintenance personnel in the vicinity or a reduction in road width due to waste collection activities, requiring the driver to proceed with increased attention. No other road users or traffic-related elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers are reported in the scene."

As a driver, one should be aware that garbage bags on the street can potentially be a hazard if they obstruct part of the road or if their contents spill out. Caution should be taken to avoid collisions with garbage bags, and they may require the ego car to slightly adjust its path to maintain a safe distance.",
