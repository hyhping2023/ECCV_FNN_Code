        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, the following road users and objects are present:\n\nVehicles: There are two groups of vehicles noted. The first is a white van parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego car. This stationary vehicle doesn't directly interfere with the ego car's immediate path; however, it does make the usable part of the road narrower, requiring careful driving to maintain a safe distance. The second group consists of several cars ahead in the same lane as the ego car, all moving in the same direction. The ego car is required to follow these vehicles at their pace, ready to adjust speed if they decelerate or come to a halt.\n\nVulnerable Road Users: A pedestrian is spotted on the sidewalk, right next to where the white van is parked. While currently not on the roadway, the presence of the pedestrian on the sidewalk should be continuously monitored by the autonomous system, considering the possibility of them deciding to cross the road.\n\nTraffic Lights: A traffic light is visible in the distance, positioned above the center of the road and displaying a green light. The green signal permits the ego car to continue forward; however, it's crucial to stay alert for any sudden change in the traffic light and the behavior of other road users at the intersection, who might not act as expected.\n\nOther Objects: There's a bucket positioned on the curb, right in front of the parked white van. Although not an immediate threat since it's not on the driving path, its proximity to the roadway is cause for attention, should it unexpectedly be moved onto the road.\n\nIn summary, the scene requires the ego car to navigate cautiously, paying close attention to stationary and moving vehicles, potentially unpredictable pedestrians, obeying traffic lights while being prepared for changes, and watching for any objects that could pose unexpected hazards."

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the pedestrian on the sidewalk for any signs of intent to cross the street. Since the road conditions seem normal, continue to drive at a speed suitable for the traffic condition while remaining vigilant for any road objects that might enter the driving lane. Proceed with caution as you approach the traffic light ahead, be prepared to stop if the light is red, and adjust speed according to the state of the traffic light and the flow of the moving vehicles."
