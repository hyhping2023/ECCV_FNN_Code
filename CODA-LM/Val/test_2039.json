It occupies the majority of the lane and moves in the same direction. This construction vehicle's large size and position will influence the ego car's actions, requiring the car to maintain a safe driving distance and potentially prepare for a lane change if the vehicle slows down or stops unexpectedly.\n\nNo visible traffic lights are present in the current field of view, meaning the ego car must depend on other cues, such as the behavior of nearby vehicles and road markings, to navigate safely.\n\nAdditionally, green construction barriers are present on the right side of the road, indicating nearby construction work that could affect lane width and road conditions. These barriers suggest that the ego car needs to stay vigilant and possibly reduce speed due to potential lane narrowing or other hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of a large construction vehicle ahead of the ego car, it is suggested to maintain a safe following distance, monitor the vehicle's behavior, and be prepared for any stops or slow-downs. Since construction barriers are present, it's also advised to watch for any changes in lane conditions and be ready to reduce speed. Furthermore, the ego car should also be ready for a potential lane change if the opportunity arises and it is safe to do so. Maintain a cautious speed and increase following distance from the truck carrying the heavy machinery, as it may slow down or make unexpected movements due to its load. Be prepared for potential changes in road conditions due to the green barriers indicating construction or road work ahead. Stay attentive to any sudden appearance of traffic lights or signs that may instruct a change in driving behavior. The ego vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to either change lanes to the left if the adjacent lane is clear or come to a stop if it is unsafe to change lanes, maintaining a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead. The flashing lights on the construction vehicle indicate that drivers should be cautious. It is also important to monitor the vehicle's behavior, as it may make unexpected movements."
