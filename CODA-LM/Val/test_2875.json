This individual is facing away from the road and is stationary. Although they are not currently on the road, their proximity to the roadway and their attention towards something off-frame make their behavior unpredictable, and they could potentially enter the road at any moment, necessitating cautious monitoring.\n\nAdditionally, there are other objects present, including large cable reels stacked against a wall and assorted industrial debris on the right side of the road. While these objects do not pose an immediate threat as they are not encroaching on the drivable area, they indicate nearby construction activity.

Observe the right-hand side for any construction-related vehicles or additional workers that may affect traffic flow. Continue to monitor the road for any changes due to potential nearby construction."
