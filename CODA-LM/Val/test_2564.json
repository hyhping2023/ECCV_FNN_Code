        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a notable presence of a traffic cone on the road. Specifically, a bright orange traffic cone is located on the right side of the road, with a part of it slightly protruding into the driving lane. The placement of this cone is a clear indication that there might be potential dangers or ongoing roadwork ahead. As a result, it necessitates careful driving from the ego car, including a slight adjustment of the vehicle's position to the left within the lane. However, it's crucial to ensure that this maneuver does not lead to crossing the centerline, maintaining safe driving conditions. Other categories such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects do not have any entries, indicating their absence in the observed traffic image."

Stay alert for signs that may be obscured, changes in road conditions, or unexpected hazards, such as workers or equipment near the traffic cone area.",

            "description and explanation": "A safety device shaped like an inverted cone usually colored in bright shades, such as orange, with a white reflective band positioned on the side of the road. It is used to signal caution and to demarcate an area for various reasons, like roadside construction, a hazard, or lane redirection. The presence of this cone requires the driver of the ego car to stay alert, slow down if necessary, and potentially steer slightly away from the cone to avoid it while ensuring the vehicle remains safely within the lane of travel.",
