Positioned in varying orientations, some of these cars face the ego vehicle, while others are stationed along the roadside. These vehicles pose a situation where the ego car must stay alert to their potential movements, with a particular focus on those near the intersection, as they may intersect the ego car's planned route.\n\nVulnerable road users, namely pedestrians, are observed utilizing a marked crosswalk directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The crossing pedestrians hold the priority, compelling the ego car to yield to them, ensuring their safety which might include coming to a full halt if necessary.\n\nTraffic lights for the lane which the ego car occupies are currently red. This mandates that the ego car must cease movement at the intersection and await the light to switch to green before continuing.\n\nAdditionally, an obstruction is discernible in the form of a signboard located at the edge of the pedestrian crossing, encroaching slightly onto the road. The proximity of this signboard could impede the pathway or sightlines of the ego car, making it essential for the car to acknowledge and track the position of the sign in relation to its intended trajectory. \n\nThe information bears no mention of traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers in the environment, suggesting their absence from this particular scene."
