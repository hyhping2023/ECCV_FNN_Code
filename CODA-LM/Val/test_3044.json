This requires the main vehicle to maintain a safe distance and possibly stop or take a detour due to the road construction. Additionally, a white car is partially visible on the right side but does not interfere with the main vehicle's path, only serving for situational awareness.\n\nNear the crane operation area on the closed road section, construction personnel in high-visibility clothing are walking on foot. This requires the driver to exercise extra caution, follow temporary traffic directions, and be prepared to stop to ensure the workers' safety.\n\nThe traffic light ahead displays a red light, signaling the main vehicle to stop and wait until the light turns green.\n\nTemporary yellow and black barriers are closing off a section of the road due to construction, indicating that part of the road is closed and that detours are in effect. These barriers protect the construction area and guide traffic, necessitating that vehicles either stop or take the designated detour."

The vehicle should also be prepared to follow any detour routes or traffic control provided by the construction workers to navigate around construction equipment and workers on the road. Considering the wet and slippery road conditions, speed should be reduced to accommodate the slick surface and narrowed lanes due to construction obstacles and cones.",
