        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. A large truck is present on the opposite lane, which could potentially be dangerous if it were to intrude into our lane, requiring us to take evasive action. Additionally, a white van is traveling in the same direction as our vehicle, positioned on the front left side. This van could slow down, stop suddenly, or change lanes, so we must remain cautious. There is also a white car parked by the roadside, next to a pile of building materials. This situation could lead to traffic obstruction if the parked vehicle were to move unexpectedly or if pedestrians were to gather around it.\n\nOn the right side of the road, behind the parked white sedan, there is a blue traffic sign that provides direction or location information. This sign is informational and does not necessitate immediate action. Traffic cones, which are red and white, are placed on the right side of the road, indicating a work area or road obstacles. These cones suggest that vehicles should shift slightly to the left to avoid the marked area.\n\nFurthermore, there are low barriers or walls on both sides of the road, possibly indicating a construction zone or delineating roadside property. These barriers are important for marking the road's boundaries and potential work or activity areas, alerting drivers to the possibility of unexpected obstacles.\n\nLastly, construction materials are piled up next to the parked white car on the right side of the road. The presence of these materials is a sign of ongoing construction activity, which could lead to the emergence of workers or unexpected movements near the road."

It should slow down when necessary to prepare for any hazards surrounding a parked sedan and slightly shift to the left to safely pass traffic cones, while also watching out for any potential construction workers or equipment. It is advised to maintain a moderate speed and heightened situational awareness in this area where lane markings are not visible.",
