        "description and explanation": "In the image captured, we see no vehicles present, which simplifies the decision-making process for our autonomous system. However, there are vulnerable road users to be aware of. Specifically, there's a person riding a bicycle on the right edge, clothed in a red jacket and dark pants, moving in the same direction as the traffic. Caution must be exercised as cyclists could alter their path unexpectedly, hence the need to keep a safe distance. Additionally, on the left lane ahead, there is a light-duty cargo tricycle, identified by its red rear and blue canopy over its cargo space. This vehicle is slower than the typical traffic flow and may perform unforeseen actions; our car might have to consider lane changes or speed alterations in response.\n\nOn the regulatory side, there is a \"No Parking\" sign on the right. It's an indication that parking is prohibited on the roadside, which doesn't at the moment-affect our driving behavior.\n\nLastly, the presence of motorcycles and related objects parked on the right side narrows the usable lane width. Our autonomous car system must take into account that these could become roadblocks if they were to fall onto the roadway. No other traffic signs, lights, cones, barriers, or additional objects are noted in the image, thus no further actions are necessary in these categories."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the slow-moving tricycle ahead, this vehicle should prepare to slow down or change lanes to overtake, ensuring that it does so safely and in accordance with traffic regulations. Additionally, due to the presence of cyclists on the right, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance, always ready to react to any potential sudden movements. Keeping a safe distance from the roadside is necessary to avoid potential dangers from parked motorcycles and other objects. Continuously monitoring these road users and being ready to respond to any sudden lane changes or stops is key to ensuring safety.",

The presence of such an object in the driving path can be a potential hazard for vehicles, especially for those with two wheels, as hitting it might lead to a loss of control. The ego car should maintain awareness of such obstacles and be prepared to safely navigate around them to avoid damage to the vehicle or a collision that could result from a sudden maneuver to evade the object.",
