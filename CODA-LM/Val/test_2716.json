Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked along the side of the road, narrowing the space for the ego car to navigate and requiring careful driving. A blue parking sign with a white 'P' and an arrow is also present, indicating a parking area that could lead vehicles to move towards the ego car's path. Yellow and red traffic cones are set up on the right side of the road, signaling an off-limits area or ongoing construction, which reduces the drivable road width and necessitates cautious driving and potential lane adjustments by the ego car. Red and white barriers are placed before the traffic cones, further highlighting the restricted area and directing the ego car to stay within the safe driving lane. Lastly, a large advertising board on the right side could distract drivers, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors such as sudden deceleration."

Any visual or auditory signals indicating the white car's intent to merge should be monitored closely by the ego car's sensors and systems. Proceed with caution, especially when approaching the white sedan that may merge into traffic. Keep a safe distance from parked cars to have enough reaction time if pedestrians or other vehicles suddenly appear. Stay alert for the traffic cones indicating road works or obstructions, and be prepared to merge left safely if necessary. Monitor the behavior of other drivers who may be distracted by the advertising board. Reduce speed if the road conditions require it and always be ready to adjust the driving path in response to road users' actions."
