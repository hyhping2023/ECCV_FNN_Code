Starting with vehicles, a dark SUV is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego car, which reduces the space available on the road for maneuvering. Additionally, multiple cars are parked on both sides of the street. One car, in particular, is covered with a blue tarp on the left side, which not only limits the usable width of the road but also potentially hides road hazards.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, a pedestrian clad in red is spotted crossing the street from right to left ahead of the ego car, necessitating a reduction in speed or a complete stop to ensure their safe passage. Additionally, on the right sidewalk, a group of pedestrians is seen close to the edge of the road which could be problematic if one unexpectedly steps onto the road. On the opposite side, a pedestrian with a dog is seen interacting with someone at a market stand set up on the sidewalk. While they aren't on the road, their proximity and possible sudden movements pose a safety risk.\n\nAs for other objects, there's significant street-side market activity to the right of the scene with various stalls and goods extending close to the edge of the road, posing potential obstructions and creating the risk of unpredictable pedestrian movements. There's also a dustbin placed by the roadside near both the pedestrians and market activity, which should serve as a point of reference for the ego car to keep a safe distance from the roadside.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this scene."

Keep an eye on the street-side market activity for any unforeseen obstacles or sudden pedestrian crossings. Continuous observation of the pedestrians' movements is crucial as they may step onto the road. The street-side market's activities should also be monitored for any sudden movements or obstacles that might come from that direction."
