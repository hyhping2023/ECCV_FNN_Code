        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several vehicles ahead, specifically cars and trucks, located in the front left lane. The presence of these vehicles indicates an active traffic stream, which our autonomous vehicle will need to follow or negotiate a way around safely, ensuring smooth integration into the flow of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, on the distant right side of the road, there is a vulnerable road user segment, which includes an individual on a bicycle and another on a motorcycle, positioned ahead of their corresponding vehicles. This dynamic hints at the potential challenges for our vehicle, such as the need to prepare for their possible entry into traffic from a side road or performing an unexpected maneuver. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle must maintain an adequate distance from these users and vigilantly track their movements to prevent any unsafe interactions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from heavy machinery vehicles and be prepared to slow down in case they make unexpected maneuvers. When overtaking, give cyclists enough space to ensure their safety and comply with traffic laws relevant to passing vulnerable road users. Stay alert to any changes in road users' behavior or the emergence of new elements in the traffic scene, which may require adjusting your driving strategy. Your vehicle should keep a safe distance from cranes and be prepared to slow down if necessary due to a reduction in lane width, and exercise caution when overtaking. Additionally, when overtaking, your vehicle should be careful to notice cyclists and ensure there is enough room to pass safely without endangering them. Merge into the left lane carefully, being mindful of the traffic flow and vehicles ahead. Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from construction vehicles ahead, ready to slow down or stop, and consider switching to the left lane if the right lane is blocked by construction vehicles or the road narrows due to construction activities. Furthermore, your vehicle should monitor vulnerable road users on the roadside, yield the way when necessary, giving them ample space, and adhere to all safety protocols for sharing the road with cyclists and motorcyclists.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle equipped with a crane. Its size and positioning on the road indicate it may be engaged in construction or maintenance work, potentially leading to slowed or stopped traffic. Future driving behavior for the ego car should include maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. Additionally, being cautious and alert for any sudden movements from the construction vehicle is prudent, as it may need to maneuver or occupy a larger portion of the road during its operations.",
