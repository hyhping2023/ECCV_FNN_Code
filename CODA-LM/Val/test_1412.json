        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several noteworthy elements affecting the driving behavior. Primarily, there is a large truck ahead in the same lane as our vehicle. It is directly fitted with a green structure, potentially carrying agricultural or construction equipment, and is traveling in the same direction. The size of this truck, along with its cargo, may hinder visibility for our vehicle. As such, it is crucial to maintain an increased following distance to safeguard against potential hazards such as falling debris or the truck's sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian, distinguishable by their yellow clothing, is positioned on the side of the road to the left of our vehicle. Although this pedestrian is currently not on the road, their proximity to the traffic flow necessitates vigilant observation. This caution is in anticipation of any unexpected attempt they may make to cross the street, posing a potential risk.\n\nMoreover, on the left side of the road, there's a row of barriers or guardrails separating the vehicular lane from the sidewalk and the adjacent green space. These barriers serve as an important reminder that there is limited space available for maneuvers such as making a U-turn to the left. Consequently, these barriers dictate that lateral movements in that direction should be avoided by the vehicle.\n\nThe image does not feature any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would typically influence the driving behavior, as those categories were noted to be empty. This analysis helps in understanding the significant environmental factors that should guide the autonomous driving systemâ€™s decision-making process in real-time."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from trucks, always ready to respond to sudden stops and reduced visibility. Pay close attention to the dynamics of motorcycles; if they suddenly change lanes or stop, be prepared to react. Watch for pedestrians standing by the roadside; do not speed, and be ready to stop if a pedestrian steps onto the road. Considering road conditions and potential congestion caused by large vehicles ahead, reduce speed, stay alert, and be prepared for any maneuvers by pedestrians or motorcyclists. Due to obstacles on the left, avoid unnecessary lane changes and adjust your driving behavior according to potentially slippery road conditions, such as slowing down and extending braking distance. Since farm vehicles are large and may cause obstructions, monitor the behavior of motorcyclists who may also attempt to overtake.",

It has a visible equipment boom extended above its base, which suggests that it is a specialized vehicle likely used for tasks such as lifting or moving materials. Due to its size and the nature of the equipment it carries, this vehicle could restrict the flow of traffic, and following drivers, including the driver of the ego car, should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from this oversized vehicle.",
