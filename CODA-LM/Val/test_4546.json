        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several key road users that are affecting driving behaviors:\n\nFirst, there is a large cement mixer positioned to the right of our vehicle. It occupies the adjacent lane and part of its body is extending into our lane. Given that the truck could potentially invade our lane, it represents a hazard that might require the vehicle to either maneuver carefully or adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nAhead in the same lane, there is a white car at a considerable distance from us, identifiable by its illuminated taillights. Because the car ahead has the potential to slow down or stop, it is imperative for our vehicle to keep a safe following distance to anticipate any sudden changes in the car's speed and to react accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, we have a white car coming from the opposite direction, traveling in the left lane and approaching our vehicle. This car is an important consideration because our vehicle may need to assess the possibility of changing lanes to the left to avoid the construction vehicles on the right, and the oncoming vehicle's presence is a critical factor in making a safe lane change.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image, hence they do not influence the driving decisions at this moment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the mixer truck and the white car ahead, and pay attention to their speed or position changes. Be prepared to adjust your vehicle's speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid the mixer truck's hanging parts. Also, remain aware of other potential hazards that may not be visible due to limited image quality at night. Closely monitor the movements of construction vehicles, and be ready to slow down or change lanes if they intrude into your lane. Before changing lanes, consider oncoming traffic and indicate your intention to other road users through proper signals. Stay alert to unexpected movements by construction vehicles. Keep a safe distance from the large truck in front, monitoring its indicators to anticipate possible turns or maneuvers. Watch for vehicles further away in the left lane ahead in case they change lanes or adjust their speed, which would require a response from your vehicle. Continue to follow the green light at the intersection unless the situation changes, while remaining vigilant for any new obstacles that may come into view.",
