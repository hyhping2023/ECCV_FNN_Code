This vehicle's presence and movement directly influence the ego car's speed and following distance. Several construction workers wearing high-visibility clothing are visible near roadwork on the right side. These workers may enter the road or affect traffic flow, necessitating reduced speed and heightened awareness.\n\nA blue and white road sign indicates upcoming construction, with a supplementary sign warning of increased travel time due to construction. This sign suggests potential road work and disruptions, so the ego car should prepare to reduce speed or follow detour instructions. Additionally, a partially obstructed directional sign above the road indicates lane directions, suggesting a split in the road or an upcoming junction. This aids the driver in preparing for road layout changes and choosing the correct lane.\n\nThe image also shows multiple traffic cones arranged to guide vehicles away from the right side of the lane, signifying a narrowed path due to construction. Consequently, the ego car needs to maneuver slightly left to avoid the construction zone. Additionally, temporary fencing and red and white barrier panels mark the boundary of the construction zone on the right side of the road, which are non-passable obstacles the ego car must avoid by staying in the open lane."

Observing any temporary traffic signs or signals installed due to construction will be critical for safe navigation. Additionally, passing the parked or stopped black sedan cautiously and maintaining a safe distance from the construction workers are also advised. Be alert for any additional signs or changes in the road layout ahead."
