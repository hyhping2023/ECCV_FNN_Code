Meanwhile, they should also monitor parked vehicles for any unexpected movements, such as opening doors or pedestrians stepping out from between vehicles. Drivers should remain alert to the white sedan approaching and ensure to maintain a safe distance. Due to parked vehicles and barriers indicating construction or closed areas reducing lane width, drivers should keep left while passing these obstacles and traffic cones, and exercise caution in this altered traffic environment. Furthermore, self-driving cars should wait for pedestrians to finish crossing and monitor the white car crossing the intersection. After ensuring there are no other immediate hazards and considering the wet road conditions, self-driving cars can proceed cautiously, avoid traffic cones, and remain vigilant of any indicated reroutes or lane closures.",
