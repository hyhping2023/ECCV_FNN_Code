        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there is a red car positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, situated in the center of the driving lane with its brake lights on. This indicates that the car is either moving slowly or has come to a complete stop, necessitating that the ego vehicle adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes vulnerable road users, specifically pedestrians crossing the street at a zebra crossing in front of the ego car. This situation requires the ego vehicle to either stop or yield according to traffic rules to ensure the safety of the pedestrians. On the sidewalk to the right, there is also a pedestrian walking with a white dog ahead of them, parallel to the road. Although they are not on the road, their proximity necessitates close monitoring by the ego vehicle in case they unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a traffic light further ahead is visible, displaying a green light. However, despite the green light indicating permission to proceed, the ego vehicle must remain stationary due to the crossing pedestrians and the stationary vehicle ahead that has not yet moved.\n\nThe traffic lights category reiterates the presence of a green light for the lane in which the ego vehicle and the car in front are traveling. This green light suggests that movement is permitted, yet the ego vehicle must consider other factors, such as the stopped car ahead, before proceeding.\n\nLastly, among other objects, there is a white domestic animal, possibly a cat, observed on the right side of the road, crossing the street. This unexpected road user presents a potential hazard, requiring the ego vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop to avoid an accident. Furthermore, a white cat is seen in the crosswalk, moving across the street in the same direction as the pedestrians, adding another layer of consideration for the ego vehicle to ensure safe passage for all road users involved."

Despite the green light, the vehicle must not proceed until the path is free of road users and it is safe to continue. The ego vehicle should monitor the red car in front for movement, but should not rely on it alone to determine when to proceed, as the pedestrians and other road users have the right of way in this scenario. Stay alert to the pedestrian and the dog on the right to anticipate potential road entry. Proceed with caution due to green traffic light and night-time driving conditions. Continue to observe for any additional road users or changes in traffic signal."
