        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic situation, there are a few noteworthy observations regarding road users that impact driving behavior. Primarily, a yellow crane truck can be seen extending its arm across the roadway, with a black truck situated behind it. This setup is blocking the two rightmost lanes on our side of the road. The presence of these vehicles is a clear signal that work might be in progress, or there is a potential obstacle. Consequently, a lane change by our vehicle is necessary to ensure safe travel and avoid the blocked area.\n\nIn addition to the crane truck and the black truck, there's also a long, articulated flatbed truck parked in the lane next to the obstructed right lane. Interestingly, this truck is facing the opposite direction to that of our vehicle. This could be a sign that there is construction or work nearby, which has the potential to disrupt the regular flow of traffic.\n\nSupplementing these vehicles, orange traffic cones have been laid out around the work site. These cones begin from the far-right lane and merge into the second lane from the right. The arrangement of these cones is a directive for vehicles traveling in the affected lane to merge leftward. This action is crucial for avoiding the work site and maintaining a smooth flow of traffic.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the JSON data. These categories do not contain any items, implying that they do not have an impact on the driving situation in the image presented."

    "driving_suggestion": "If the self-driving car is in the leftmost lane, it should maintain its current lane; if in a right-hand lane, it should prepare to merge left, slowing down appropriately and signaling to ensure a safe lane change to avoid construction site obstacles. Additionally, the vehicle should be aware of any instructions from temporary traffic signals or traffic controllers that may not be visible in the image. Due to the possibility of movement from workers or trucks and cranes further affecting the road, vigilance should be increased. As the vehicle moves forward, stay alert for any additional signs or signals that may emerge and follow the directions of any safe navigation zones. Self-driving cars should slow down and be prepared to stop or switch to the furthest right lane to bypass the work zone and trucks with extended booms. As trucks obstruct the right and some center lanes, self-driving vehicles must be cautious when merging left, checking for other vehicles in the blind spots. Furthermore, if the traffic light for the self-driving vehicle's lane turns red, it should be prepared to stop. Maintaining a safe following distance and being ready to respond to sudden stops from vehicles ahead is also advisable.",
