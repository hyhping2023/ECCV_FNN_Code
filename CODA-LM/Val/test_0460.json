        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are a couple of notable elements that affect the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle. First, a large red truck is located in the left lane, appearing to be stationary or traveling very slowly and is diagonally positioned in the direction of travel. This requires our vehicle to either decelerate or consider lane switching to avoid the truck. Simultaneously, there's a white mini-truck on the right side of our vehicle, occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The proximity of this vehicle restricts our ability to change lanes to the right as a means of bypassing the red truck.\n\nAlthough there's an absence of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in this scene, which means our vehicle doesn't need to make any immediate maneuvers in regards to these road users, traffic cones are present on the left-hand side near the large red truck. These represent either ongoing road construction or a lane closure, signaling that the lane is closed to traffic and instructing drivers to remain in their current lane or safely change lanes when possible.\n\nFurthermore, the scene doesn't present any physical barriers that would guide traffic flow or obstruct the road, nor are there other significant objects or debris on the road that could influence the driving decision of our vehicle. Therefore, no specific actions are required with respect to the barriers and other objects."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain its current lane and be prepared to slow down due to the red truck that may obstruct the lane. The driver should observe the position and movement of surrounding vehicles, especially the white truck on the right, to avoid collisions when changing lanes. If a lane change is necessary, use the rear-view mirrors and check blind spots. Continue to monitor changes in traffic conditions on the road ahead and any new road users. Due to obstructions caused by the red dump truck and traffic cones on the right, if our vehicle is not in the right lane, it should switch to the right lane. Maintain a safe distance from the white truck ahead and be prepared for possible braking or steering maneuvers from the truck and other vehicles. Given the indicated road construction, be extra alert and mindful of any changes in workers or traffic patterns.",

It has a large cargo compartment which indicates that it could be carrying heavy loads. Due to its size and nature of use, the construction vehicle may move slower than regular traffic and may make wide turns or sudden stops. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, anticipate potential stops or turns, and be prepared for reduced speeds in the vicinity of the construction vehicle.",
