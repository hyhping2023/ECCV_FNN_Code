The traffic light is a green arrow type, installed on a temporary barrier in the middle of the road, signalling permission to proceed only in the direction the arrow is pointing. This green arrow is critical as it overrides other signals and it instructs the ego car to continue its journey, strictly in the indicated arrow's direction. Additionally, there is a portable barrier which includes both a traffic light and a directional arrow board, positioned in the road's center. This setup is likely indicative of road construction or a lane closure, necessitating vehicles to adjust their lanes or merge accordingly. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or miscellaneous objects reported that would affect the ego carâ€™s driving decisions in this scenario."
