There's a bicycle leaned against a street post on the sidewalk to the right of the road, which is not in use but should be monitored in case a user returns to it unexpectedly. \n\nA green traffic light is visible straight ahead, indicating that the ego car can proceed, provided the intersection is clear.\n\nA large green dumpster is positioned on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane. This requires the ego car to check if the adjacent lane is clear before maneuvering around the obstacle.\n\nAdditionally, there are other objects including the aforementioned large green dumpster, which reduces the available lane width necessitating a check of the opposite lane for a safe overtake, and abandoned bicycles leaning against a snow pile on the right side. These bicycles are not directly obstructing the roadway but should be noted in case they become an unexpected hazard."
