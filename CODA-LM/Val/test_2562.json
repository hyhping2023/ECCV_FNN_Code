    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of the large truck on the right and the nighttime driving conditions, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck, reduce speed to accommodate potential limited visibility, and be prepared for the truck's possible maneuvers. The driver should also be attentive to any road users that may be hidden by the truck's large blind spots, and monitor the truck's lights and indicators for clues about its intentions. The ego car should slow down to adapt to the low visibility nighttime conditions and potential wet road. Increase following distance due to the presence of multiple vehicles ahead with brake lights on. Prepare for evasive maneuvers if the truck ahead is obstructing the lane or behaves unpredictably. The high-beam headlights from the truck may impact visibility, so the ego car should use its own headlight effectively to ensure clear sight of the road ahead. Due to the presence of a large truck in close proximity to the ego vehicle's lane and the appearance of wet road conditions, the ego vehicle should reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, the driver should be ready to perform a lane change if the truck remains an obstacle and if it is safe to do so. Caution should be exercised due to the potential for slippery road conditions and the presence of other vehicles ahead that may affect traffic flow."
