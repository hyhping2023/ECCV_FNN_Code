On the right side of the road, a stationary dark-colored van is present without any lights or movement, potentially blocking the lane or unexpectedly moving, thus caution is advised while passing it. Additionally, a motorcyclist is seen riding slightly towards the right side of the lane ahead, necessitating close observation due to their unpredictability and vulnerability. Regarding road signs, a mandatory direction sign indicates that a turn to the right is required, guiding the vehicle's path. Several traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, signifying possible hazards or construction work ahead that might narrow the driving space. Lastly, a luminous sign is noticed on the right, along with street lights and an unlit object; however, they do not seem to have an immediate impact on this vehicle's driving decisions. There are no traffic lights or barriers noted in the current overview of the traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the nighttime environment and the position of the stationary van, this vehicle should slow down and remain highly vigilant to guard against any unexpected movements from the van. It is imperative to follow the mandatory direction signs and travel on the right side of the road. The presence of traffic cones means one should drive carefully, as there may be road construction or obstacles ahead. The vehicle's lights must be adjusted properly to ensure sufficient road illumination without causing glare. This vehicle should maintain a safe following distance with motorcycles, ready to react to their sudden changes in movement. Given the low visibility, if the headlights are not on, they should be used, with extra attention to any sudden obstacles or road users that may be difficult to detect at night. Due to potential slippery road conditions, this vehicle should decelerate, maintain a safe distance from the vehicles parked on the right, and prepare to change lanes or turn right according to traffic sign instructions, while also watching out for oncoming traffic and possible danger warning traffic cones on the roadside.",
