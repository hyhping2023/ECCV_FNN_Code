This vehicle impacts the ego car's driving by dictating its speed and ensuring that safe following distances and reaction times are maintained.

If the animal looks likely to enter the driving lane, the ego car should slow down and be prepared to stop. Continuing at a lower speed is advisable until the animal is safely clear of the potential driving path. The narrow road limits overtaking opportunities and requires more time to react to sudden stops or turns by the vehicle in front. Constant vigilance of the dog's position will be necessary until it is safely cleared from the road."
