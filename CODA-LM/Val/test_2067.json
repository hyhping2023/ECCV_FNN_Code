Autonomous vehicles should track their movement to prevent potential hazards should any of them step onto the road unintentionally.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead showing a green signal, permitting the vehicle to proceed. Despite the go-ahead, the vehicle must remain vigilant for any sudden shifts in the traffic lights or unexpected actions from other road users which might impact its priority on the road.\n\nAlso notable are the temporary traffic barriers installed on the right side of the road. These are associated with a construction zone, as indicated by nearby cone-shaped signs, and suggest that vehicles, including self-driving cars, should remain on the left and keep a safe distance from the work area to avoid incidents."
