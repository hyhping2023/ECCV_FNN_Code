A construction vehicle is obstructing two lanes in the middle of the road without clear indications of being part of a work zone. This vehicle is an immediate obstacle, suggesting potential construction activity ahead, which may require drivers to slow down or stop.\n2. A white car is parked on the far left side of the road. Although it is not moving, it could become a hazard if the door opens or pedestrians appear suddenly from behind it.\n3. A silver car is parked in front of the white car, with a person standing beside the driver's side. The presence of the cars and person suggests a risk of unexpected movement or car doors opening into the road.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A pedestrian is standing next to a parked car on the left side, facing the road and appears to be observing the traffic. This pedestrian could be a risk if they unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nBarriers:\n1. A blue barrier is placed on the right side of the road, limiting access to the area beyond and possibly indicating construction activities. It serves to direct traffic flow or mark work areas.\n2. A yellow and black striped pillar is located on the right side, near the sidewalk, marking a specific area. This may signal areas to avoid due to construction or maintenance work.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to stationary construction vehicles blocking the lane, self-driving vehicles should decelerate and be prepared to stop if necessary. Drivers should scan the environment for any construction workers, extra signs, or signals that might indicate how to navigate through the area. If it is safe and there are indications that vehicles can pass, drivers may be able to use the available space on the right side of the road to bypass the obstacle, while closely monitoring the movements of pedestrians. Staying alert to any changes in the situation or unexpected actions by other road users is crucial.",

In this driving scenario, the presence of a bollard on the side of the road serves as an indication that the ego car should maintain its lane and avoid any maneuvers that may bring it too close to the curb or the delineated side area. The bollard may also indicate the beginning of a pedestrian zone or a similarly protected area where vehicles are not permitted, ensuring the safety of pedestrians and property adjacent to the roadway.",
