The presence of the bus may present a potential obstacle if it decides to change lanes or make a stop, thus requiring careful monitoring by the ego car. The second vehicle is a dark vehicle in the distance ahead of the ego car, in the same lane. The vehicle's presence requires monitoring for speed changes and maintaining a safe following distance.
