Avoid the restricted right lane where the traffic cones are placed and continue monitoring the vehicles ahead for any changes in their speed or lane changes due to the roadwork or upcoming curve. The ego car should also be ready to change lanes to the left in response to the traffic cones and lane closure indicated by the barriers and signs. The driver should monitor the behavior of other vehicles carefully to anticipate their movements and respond accordingly. It is also essential to stay alert for any potential new signs or road changes that may come into view."
