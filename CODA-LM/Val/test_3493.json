Following the truck is a smaller vehicle, also in the right lane, which may impact the truck's speed and lane changes. Additionally, there are warning signs about an upcoming construction zone, alerting drivers to possible alterations in traffic flow, lane closures, and reduced speed limits. The road is lined with yellow and black traffic cones, signaling a narrowed passage that requires caution and slower speeds. White barriers divide the road and indicate construction or restricted areas, thus potentially affecting traffic flow and lane usage. Finally, a guard booth situated near the construction signs implies potential for activities that could cause unexpected distractions or direct traffic interventions. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other noted obstacles in the current dataset."

Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to adhere to any temporary traffic control instructions or modified traffic patterns. Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead to ensure adequate reaction time and visibility. Be prepared for potential slowing or stopping of traffic. Watch for any changes in the truck's lane position which could indicate an intention to change lanes or turn. Remain vigilant for any pedestrians near the guard booth on the right. Follow the lane demarcated by the traffic cones and adhere to the barrier-separated lanes. Continue to assess the road conditions ahead as the ego car proceeds. Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, prepare to slow down due to the construction zone, and do not attempt to overtake until it is safe and legal to do so. The ego car should monitor the construction area for any workers or unexpected obstacles, and adhere to any posted speed limits or construction signs that may be present."
