The truck's rear warning lights and reflective markings are clearly visible, indicating its presence and size. The position of the truck directly in front limits the maneuverability of our vehicle and necessitates maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are barriers present in the image. A low barrier at the bottom edge of the picture is covered with reflective materials and warning lights, preventing the autonomous vehicle from suddenly changing lanes and requiring the driver to continue along the lane until a suitable gap or intersection is found. There is also a metal fence on the left side of the main vehicle, which appears to surround a potential construction or work area. These barriers mark a restricted area, which may affect lane availability and traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, there are other objects in the vicinity of the self-driving car. Debris is present on the road to the right side of the vehicle, right next to the metal fence, which may pose a danger and could require the self-driving car to adjust its trajectory to avoid it. Additionally, there is a streetlight pole to the right of the self-driving car, directly on the sidewalk. While the pole does not directly affect driving behavior, it does mark the boundary of the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, monitoring its brake lights in case of sudden stops. Since traffic lights are not visible, continue to observe any possible traffic control devices that may be present, which will guide the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Comply with normal road safety precautions, follow lane markings, and respect lane dividers. Lastly, if necessary, adjust the vehicle's lights to counter glare and reflections for optimal visibility. Stay in the current lane, avoiding obstacles and debris on the right side, while monitoring any situations that may require changing lanes or taking other evasive actions. If the truck stops, be prepared to stop, and drive cautiously due to limited visibility ahead. If the truck is about to turn or change lanes, pay attention to any indications. The autonomous vehicle should be vigilant in observing any additional road signs, signals, or traffic changes that might appear ahead.",
