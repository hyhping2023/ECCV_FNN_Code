It is partially occupying the same lane as the ego car and moving in the same direction. The truck's bright taillights and working markers indicate that it is active on the road. The proximity and size of the truck are potential hazards. The ego car must be cautious, as the truck is close by and could pose a collision risk, especially if it's in the truck's blind spot or if the truck unexpectedly changes lanes.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible in the distance. It is displaying a green signal on the right side of the road, meaning the ego car and the truck have the right to continue their movement through the intersection or along the roadway without the need to stop."

It appears to be actively moving on the road, as indicated by the motion blur and the positioning of the vehicle. This truck is likely transporting goods and its size and speed should be considered by the ego car when making driving decisions. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and prepare for potential changes in the truck's speed or direction. It's vital for the ego vehicle to monitor the truck's brake lights and turn signals to anticipate its actions.",

Additionally, begin slowing down in preparation for stopping at the red traffic light ahead. Maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, be prepared to slow down or stop in case the truck makes unexpected maneuvers, and approach the traffic light with caution ready to stop if it is red. Given the possibility of a wet road, reduce speed to account for longer breaking distances and potential hydroplaning, and ensure headlights and taillights are on for visibility. Maintain a safe distance from the truck, allowing for adequate reaction time. Monitor the truck's signals for any indication of turning or changing lanes. As the traffic light is green, prepare to continue but remain vigilant for any changes in the signal or any potential hazards that may not be immediately visible."
