First, there is a yellow vehicle parked facing the ego car on the left side, slightly angled towards the driving lane. This vehicle reduces the drivable road width, necessitating careful maneuvering by the ego vehicle. Next, there's a dark-colored sedan parked on the right side of the scene, facing away from the ego vehicle. Although immobile, it also limits the available road space on its side. Moreover, directly ahead of the ego car, there is another car with its brake lights on, indicating it's either stopped or about to start moving, which requires immediate attention from the ego vehicle as this will directly affect its driving decision.\n\nAdditionally, there's a traffic cone situated to the left, beside the parked yellow vehicle. Its presence could indicate nearby roadwork or obstacles, prompting the ego car to steer clear of the cone area. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are reported in this image, implying that these categories either do not impact this specific driving scenario or are not present in the immediate vicinity."

Steering should be adjusted to maintain a safe distance from both the parked vehicles and the traffic cone, while scanning the environment for any other road users or obstacles that may not be visible due to the low-light conditions. Watch for any indications from the parked yellow vehicle, such as reverse lights or opening doors. If the braking vehicle moves forwards, proceed with caution, giving it ample space in case it stops again suddenly."
