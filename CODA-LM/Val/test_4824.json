        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several elements that an autonomous vehicle, referred to as the ego car, must consider to navigate safely. Firstly, a white SUV is spotted parked on the right side of the road. Its rear lights are on, suggesting that the vehicle might be idling or has just recently parked. The presence of this SUV is critical as it might obstruct part of the driving lane or unexpectedly start moving, necessitating the ego car to remain alert and, if necessary, perform a maneuver to safely pass it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian walking along the right side of the road, directly adjacent to where the white SUV is parked. This situation demands the ego car to reduce its speed and ensure a safe distance is maintained from the pedestrian. The ego car must also be ready to react to any unforeseen movements by the pedestrian to avoid any potential accidents.\n\nMoreover, the road scene includes yellow and black traffic cones placed to the right of the lane, directly in front of the parked SUV. The positioning of these traffic cones indicates the presence of a potential road obstruction or a work area. Consequently, it is advisable for the ego car to either slow down or shift over to the left lane to circumvent the area that has been marked off by the cones.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the provided data, implying their absence or irrelevance in this specific traffic scenario."
