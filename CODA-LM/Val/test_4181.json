        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, multiple vehicles are present, contributing to the complexity of the driving environment. A yellow heavy vehicle, possibly a truck or construction equipment, is parked on the right side of the road and is facing the opposite direction from the ego car. Its position encroaches on the road and because it is only visible from the rear and side, it poses as an obstacle. This warrants vigilance as it narrows the driving lane and may conceal pedestrians or other hazards.\n\nAdditionally, a white car is also parked further ahead on the right side of the road, facing the opposite direction. The car is situated closer to the curb than the heavy vehicle but still lies within the ego car's driving path, demanding caution as it similarly reduces the navigable road space.\n\nFurthermore, there are several other cars parked on both sides of the road, which also limit the available space for vehicles to maneuver. The presence of these parked vehicles decreases both visibility and maneuverability for the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image. It's also noted that no traffic lights are clearly identifiable, which implies that they do not have a direct effect on the driving decisions of the ego car in the immediate context."

Lane changes should be executed with care if needed to pass the parked vehicles safely. Proceed with caution, reduce speed due to wet road conditions to prevent hydroplaning, and maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles. Be prepared for the parked vehicles to begin moving and stay alert for any potential road users that may be obscured by the parked truck and car. Maintain a lower speed to account for the narrower lanes and potential wet road conditions. Increase following distances to provide more time to react if any road users emerge from behind the parked vehicles, especially around the construction vehicle. Remain vigilant for any additional hazards that may not be visible due to the parked vehicles or lighting conditions."
