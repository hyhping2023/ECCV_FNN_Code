A red flatbed trailer is located to the left, spanning the intersection perpendicularly. This trailer is obstructing the path of travel, requiring self-driving cars to wait until it clears the intersection before proceeding.\n\n2. A white concrete mixer truck has crossed the intersection ahead, occupying the lane intended for travel. This necessitates yielding until the truck has passed.\n\n3. Several motorcyclists and a cyclist are situated at the right edge of the intersection. Their vulnerable nature necessitates careful observation, as they may enter the vehicle's path or affect maneuverability within the intersection.\n\n4. A concrete central divider is present on the right side, separating the sidewalk. This divider influences the direction of travel, ensuring vehicles stay in the correct lane.\n\n5. There is a utility pole and overhead cables next to the intersection, which, while present, do not directly impact current driving decisions.\n\n6. Various small vehicles and motorcycles are positioned on the right side of the road. These vehicles may merge into the lane or obstruct visibility, so caution is advised while driving."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should remain stationary, giving way to the red flatbed trailer and the white concrete mixer truck, until the trailer has finished crossing the intersection and the mixer truck has cleared the lane. Monitor the traffic lights ahead, and once the path is clear and the light is green, our vehicle can safely pass through the intersection, staying in the correct lane as indicated by the concrete barriers. While observing the signal lights of the concrete mixer truck ahead, maintain a safe distance to respond to any lane changes or turns. Our vehicle should also watch for the movements of motorcyclists and bicyclists to anticipate any maneuvers they might take. Due to the presence of the barriers, our vehicle should stay in its own lane and be prepared to stop or continue driving based on the confirmation of the current state of the traffic lights. Act with caution before confidently assessing the traffic lights. At the same time, pay attention to any potential movements of the red truck on the right to prevent it from entering our lane.",
