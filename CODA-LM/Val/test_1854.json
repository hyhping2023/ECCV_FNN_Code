Directly ahead, several vehicles, including a brown hatchback on the left and a black sedan, are stationary due to traffic, necessitating that our vehicle maintains a safe following distance and remains ready to react to sudden stops or traffic flow changes. Vulnerable road users are also captured, with a pedestrian crossing the road necessitating a yield from vehicles, and a traffic officer directing traffic to be adhered to; another pedestrian, carrying a briefcase on the right, highlights the need for vigilance as there is a risk they may step into traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on the right indicating directions to various destinations that, while important for navigation, doesn’t immediate impact driving behavior. The traffic light visible in the distance is green, signaling the autonomous vehicle may continue with caution. The road safety measures in place include a row of black-and-white traffic cones and temporary obstacles on the pedestrian crossing’s right that suggest a required lane change or road construction, meaning drivers should reduce speed and be cautious. There are also temporary road barriers that serve to guide traffic flow and confine lane usage, ensuring that our vehicle does not attempt to cross them and instead follows the new path of the lane.\n\nOther objects identified in the image include droplets on the windshield, indicating potential visibility issues that may warrant slower speeds and increased attention, and an idle electric scooter near the right-hand sidewalk pointing towards the potential hazard of such objects unexpectedly entering the roadway."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle must come to a complete stop to yield to pedestrians and wait for the directions of the traffic police. Due to the slippery road surface and the possibility of road construction indicated by traffic cones and barriers, the vehicle, upon being granted permission to proceed, should be extra cautious and reduce speed. It is imperative to be attentive to the surrounding environment, particularly the pedestrians on the right side. The driver should comply with the traffic personnel's instructions and be prepared for changes in the normal flow of traffic. The vehicle must monitor the pedestrians on the right, especially when they are moving towards the curb, and be ready to yield if necessary. Additionally, the vehicle must observe the traffic lights for its lane and drive carefully, paying particular attention to the slippery road conditions and adjusting speed to ensure safety.",
