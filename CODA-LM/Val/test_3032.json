Their large size and potential for slow moving pose risks for safe driving when changing lanes or overtaking. Due to the truck's bulk and the possibility of it further encroaching on one's lane, it is necessary to be extra cautious and be prepared to adjust position or speed at any moment to respond to potential hazards."

        "description and explanation": "The current traffic image consists of several noteworthy elements. \n\nFirstly, there are vehicles present. A large green engineering vehicle with a crane arm is situated on the left side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. This construction vehicle might obstruct the view ahead, potentially moving or stopping suddenly, which requires added attention. Additionally, its large size and slow movement pose risks when changing lanes or overtaking. Another vehicle, a white car, is seen in the distance ahead, also traveling in the same direction. The speed and distance of this car are essential for keeping a safe following distance and predicting any abrupt speed changes.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, pedestrians are noted near a construction site on the right side of the road. Although not currently in direct danger, there's a potential risk that they might suddenly cross or enter the lane, necessitating readiness to stop at a moment's notice.\n\nA traffic light is observed ahead, displaying a green light, which permits the vehicle to continue but it is important to stay cautious for any changes to yellow, indicating a need to potentially adjust speed and position.\n\nFinally, traffic barriers with alternating yellow and black patterns are placed along the left side, enclosing a construction zone. These barriers indicate ongoing construction, suggesting that the road layout might change. They serve as a reminder to remain vigilant and prepared for possible lane width reduction or closures and to watch out for nearby construction workers or machinery."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed within the speed limit and keep to the far-right lane, ensuring a safe distance from construction vehicles and obstacles while being alert for pedestrians that may be near the construction site. Pay attention to changes in traffic lights and adjust your driving behavior as necessary. Check rearview mirrors to anticipate any unexpected movements from construction vehicles, and because of the wet road surface, keep an additional distance from the vehicle ahead. Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance with the construction vehicle ahead, adhere to the indicated speed limit, and be prepared for potential changes in lane width caused by construction obstacles. As the road surface is wet, the driver should continue to drive cautiously, pay attention to pedestrian activity and any changes in traffic lights. Maintain a safe distance from the truck on your left, be cautious of its movements, and be ready to adjust your speed or position. Slow down when approaching roundabouts and be prepared to give way. Be aware of any updates to traffic lights. Stay in the lane furthest from the construction zone on the right, be vigilant for any debris or workers, and adapt to any lane changes caused by traffic cones. Adjust your speed according to the slippery conditions and ensure a safe stopping distance.",
