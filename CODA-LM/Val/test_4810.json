However, there are a couple of significant road users and features present.\n\nWe have a cyclist on the right side of the road. The cyclist can be identified by the reflectors or lights visible on the bicycle, and their presence may necessitate a change in the vehicle's driving behavior. Specifically, the vehicle may need to slow down or change lanes to ensure there is a safe distance from the cyclist, delaying the autonomous vehicle's progress slightly to ensure safety standards are upheld.\n\nAdditionally, there are barriers to note. Metal pillars extend along the right edge, serving as a solid delimiter. The vehicle is expected to keep a safe distance from these structures to prevent potential accidents. Similarly, the road on the left side is lined with metal guardrails meant to stop cars from leaving the roadway, particularly in places where there might be hazards or a risk of a significant drop. These barriers necessitate caution and prevent the vehicle from traversing beyond the marked road limits."

If necessary, increase your vigilance and reduce speed to allow more reaction time. Drive carefully and maintain a lower speed to ensure a safe distance when passing cyclists. If possible and safe, prepare to change lanes; or before overtaking, slow down and maintain a safe distance to follow behind the cyclist. Pay attention to metal guardrails and obstacles, and stay within lane limits. Continue to monitor road conditions and any environmental changes that may affect driving behavior.",
