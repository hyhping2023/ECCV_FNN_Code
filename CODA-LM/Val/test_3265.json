        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are two vehicles present that significantly influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. On the left side, there's a dark-colored car with its red taillights on, revealing that the car is either slowing down or stopping. It is crucial for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be alert to the possibility of needing to reduce speed or come to a stop in response to the leading vehicle's actions. Meanwhile, on the right, another vehicle is identified, which is moving in the same direction as our car. The autonomous vehicle should ensure there is a safe gap between it and this neighboring car, while also observing for any potential lane changes or speed adjustments that may occur from that vehicle's maneuvers. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this specific traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the vehicle ahead, your vehicle should reduce speed and prepare for possible stops, while also remaining vigilant due to insufficient lighting to prevent accidental obstacles or road users that are difficult to detect. Furthermore, if necessary to bypass traffic cones ahead, be prepared to merge or change lanes. If not already on, turn on the headlights, and drive carefully due to reduced visibility and potential hazards. Because of the glare from oncoming vehicles' headlights, maintain a steady speed and drive cautiously when following in a lane. Pass traffic cones safely, stay in the proper lane, and be ready to navigate around any road construction. Stay alert as traffic conditions may change, but be prepared to stop if the traffic light is red. Since the road surface may be slippery, maintain a cautious speed, observe the vehicle in front to anticipate its sudden movements, and be prepared to merge left if traffic cones indicate that the road ahead is closed or lanes are reduced.",
