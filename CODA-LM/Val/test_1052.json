This situation necessitates careful consideration of the overtaking maneuver, as both the proximity and the relative speed to these motorcycles are critical in determining the safety of the maneuver. There are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image that impact the driving conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "It is advised to immediately reduce speed to assess the intentions of the blue tricycle. The vehicle should be prepared to stop or maneuver to the right side to avoid a potential head-on collision. Maintain a safe distance when overtaking or following motorcycles, and continuously monitor them for any sudden changes in speed or direction. The vehicle should keep a safe following distance from the blue tricycle, while also paying attention to distant vehicles, particularly those that appear to be crossing the road, and be ready to respond if necessary. Since there are no visible traffic control signs, it is recommended to adhere to standard road-sharing practices and defensive driving. With no lane markings, the vehicle should be cautious with lane positioning and be aware of other road users who may also be unclear about the correct lane positioning. Lastly, the vehicle should travel at a speed suitable for the road conditions.",

It is paramount for the ego vehicle to be cautious and maintain a safe distance, as such transport means are typically slower moving and less stable than regular four-wheeled vehicles. Adjusting speed and positioning to ensure the safety of all parties involved is essential.",
