The ego car should not attempt to overtake or turn across the median, and should remain in its lane unless road signs or conditions indicate otherwise. Be prepared for potential lane changes or adjustments in speed according to the overhead signage, and stay within the marked lanes, avoiding the section near the traffic cones. Always be ready to adjust to changes in road conditions or unexpected actions from other road users. Monitor the speeds and behaviors of the surrounding traffic, be alert for any information from the overhead gantry signs, and obey the traffic lights. Also, be prepared for potential weather changes that could affect driving conditions. Stay in the current lane as barriers to the right indicate no entry to the adjacent lanes or areas. Keep an eye on the vehicles in the adjacent left lane for any potential lane changes."
