Parked vehicles may partially obstruct the lane, or someone might open a car door into the lane. Additionally, due to the presence of pedestrian crosswalks, pedestrians may be nearby.\n2.

The parked vehicles have narrowed the drivable road, requiring the vehicle to drive with extra caution when passing to ensure no contact or scraping occurs.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. A red and white barrier ahead has been lowered, blocking the road and stopping traffic. This indicates that the road ahead is closed to vehicular traffic, requiring the vehicle to stop or seek an alternate route.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Temporary structures or active obstacles on the right side of the road indicate that the right side is restricted or has been closed. These barriers guide the flow of traffic and indicate areas where autonomous vehicles are prohibited from driving, influencing lane selection and navigation.\n2.

If necessary, the driver or the autonomous driving system should communicate with the staff in the booth to obtain permission to pass through the gate.
