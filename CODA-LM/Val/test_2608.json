        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several key elements that affect driving behavior, organized into categories of road users and objects: vehicles, traffic signs, and traffic lights.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there are two notable mentions. Firstly, a large tow truck positioned in the right lane, distinguished by its activated lights and carrying construction equipment. The physical size and the load it's carrying could obstruct part of the roadway and potentially reduce visibility for other road users, necessitating additional attention as it could influence the flow of traffic. Secondly, the image captures multiple vehicles ahead, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles determine the pace at which the ego car can travel, requiring careful monitoring of their braking and acceleration patterns to maintain safe driving conditions.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there's a directional sign on the right side, signifying an approaching turn or junction. This sign is crucial as it alerts drivers to potential changes in the road layout that might require lane adjustments or heightened awareness of traffic potentially merging from other directions.\n\nLastly, the traffic lights observed in the image show a green signal for the lanes moving forward. This green light indicates that traffic is allowed to continue moving but also serves as a reminder to remain vigilant for any unexpected changes in traffic conditions or the actions of other road users.\n\nThe image does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would otherwise demand attention or affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Continue to proceed while the light is green but stay alert to changing traffic conditions and any potential stops or slowing due to the tow truck's presence and size. Observe the tow truck's movements and be prepared to change lanes if necessary without impeding its operations. Observe the green traffic light and be prepared for potential changes in it, while also paying attention to the directional sign for upcoming road changes. Proceed with caution and adhere to road conditions and traffic regulations."
