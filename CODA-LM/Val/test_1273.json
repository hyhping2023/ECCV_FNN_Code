The truck is easily identifiable by its revolving drum, which suggests that it is either on its way to deliver mixed concrete or returning from a job. The presence of this truck is significant for the ego vehicle as its size and position could obstruct the view and it may perform unpredictable movements such as slowing down, stopping, or turning unexpectedly into a construction site.\n\nAdditionally, there are two green dustbins located on the right side of the road. These are placed at a safe distance from the roadway and do not present a hazard to the ego car. While they are near the roadway, they do not pose any immediate risk to the vehicle as long as they stay where they are.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
