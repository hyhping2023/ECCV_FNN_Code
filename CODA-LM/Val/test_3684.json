        "description and explanation": "This traffic image reveals three notable categories of road users impacting driving behavior. First, on the left side of the road, there are orange and yellow traffic cones, implying the presence of potential hazards or construction areas. These markers guide the direction of traffic flow and demarcate specific zones, necessitating cautious driving to avoid possible obstacles or sudden changes in traffic patterns.\n\nSecond, there is an obstacle visible to the right of the traffic cones, likely indicating road construction or a lane closure. The presence of such a barrier suggests restrictions on lane usage, affecting the vehicle's route planning.\n\nLastly, on the right, a bright light source, possibly a lamp or a reflective surface, is present. This illumination could produce glare, impeding the visibility of the driver or on-board sensors, and might signal significant areas such as entrances or checkpoints."

    "driving_suggestion": "Additionally, due to low visibility and glare from bright light sources, drive cautiously and watch for traffic cones and obstacles, as these may indicate road construction or obstructions. Once the traffic light turns green, if the right lane ahead is closed or there are unseen signs directing, vehicles should be prepared to change lanes. Given the nighttime conditions, continue to drive carefully and follow the directions indicated by the traffic cones; it may be necessary to prepare to turn right to avoid obstacles or follow a detour route.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker commonly used on roadways and footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It serves as a warning sign for drivers to avoid specific areas due to road work, obstacles, or potential hazards. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there may be some form of obstruction or hazard ahead on the road. The ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution, being prepared to alter its course around the cone or stop if necessary.",
