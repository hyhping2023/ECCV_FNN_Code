        "description and explanation": "The road is currently clear of vehicles and vulnerable road users; however, there are several important road features and objects present which have implications for navigation and safety. Reflective traffic cones with alternating red and white stripes are located along one side of the road, their purpose being to redirect vehicles safely around a potentially hazardous area that may be under construction or maintenance. Reflective barriers sporting diamond patterns are set up to lead drivers along the correct path, signifying alterations to the standard road layout and maintaining safe vehicular passage. Additionally, a metal guardrail is installed on the left side of the road, stretching into the distance, serving to prevent cars from leaving the road, particularly where there may be hidden dangers or steep declines.\n\nOn the right, drivers are alerted to the potential presence of road works or shifts in traffic flow by blue construction signs accompanied by flashing lights, prompting the need for reduced speeds and heightened caution to accommodate for eventualities such as lane restrictions or the presence of roadworkers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility at night, as well as the presence of traffic cones, obstacles, and road construction signs, the vehicle should reduce speed. Maintain a safe distance from roadside boundary markers and guardrails, and be prepared to adjust direction according to the instructions of the arrows ahead, to deal with potential bends or road detours. Turn on the high beams, and if possible, use night driving or high contrast vision assist technology. Moreover, the vehicle should follow the path outlined by the traffic cones and obstacles, stay within the lanes designated by these facilities, and be prepared to navigate bends as indicated by warning signs, ensuring safe driving while adhering to any speed limits that may be in effect for that section of the road.",

            "description and explanation": "A vertical, reflective object with alternating red and white stripes, known as a traffic delineator or marker. This object indicates the boundary of the roadway or a specific lane, guiding drivers to stay within their lane and alerting them of potential roadwork or hazards ahead. Its reflective surface improves visibility, especially at night or in low-light conditions, which is crucial for the safe navigation of the vehicle. The presence of this delineator suggests that the ego vehicle should proceed cautiously and be prepared for possible changes in the road layout or restrictions ahead.",
