There is a heavy truck with a yellow crane on the right side, partially on the road and shoulder, facing the same direction as the ego car. This truck's positioning could narrow the drivable road space and create an obstruction, requiring caution due to potential unpredictable activities.\n2. Ahead in the rightmost lane, there are several trucks and buses, some parked and others possibly moving slowly. These large vehicles might obstruct the view, make unpredictable movements like pulling out into traffic or unloading cargo, necessitating an increase in following distance and readiness to brake or maneuver.\n3. On the left side of the road, within a fenced-off construction area, there is a construction vehicle (excavator) that, while not directly on the roadway, may require caution due to proximity to the road.\n4. A silver sedan is positioned in the same lane as the ego vehicle and ahead, requiring attention for potential braking or turning movements. The sedan may influence driving behavior if it changes lanes or slows down abruptly, necessitating readiness to adjust speed or change lanes while maintaining a safe distance.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. Construction warning signs are visible on the right side of the road, ahead of the yellow crane truck. These signs indicate potential roadwork or obstructions ahead, suggesting the ego car should reduce speed and drive with increased caution.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. A series of orange traffic cones are placed along the left edge of the roadway, segregating the construction area from the active road. These cones indicate a reduction in available road width and alert drivers to the presence of road work, requiring reduced speed and heightened caution.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Temporary orange barriers are visible on the right side of the road creating a partition between the road and the construction zone. These barriers indicate construction or roadwork, and the ego car should stay clear of the partitioned area.\n2. Temporary fencing is erected around the construction area adjacent to the left side of the road. These barriers mark the construction zone limits and help guide traffic flow safely away from the work area."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the combination of construction indicators and the presence of heavy vehicles, the ego car should decrease speed while approaching this area. It should monitor the heavy truck and construction warning signs on the right closely, as they suggest a potential narrowing of the drivable road space. Keeping a safe following distance from other vehicles ahead will be crucial in case of sudden stops or reduced traffic flow. Staying within the lane and preparing for a possible merge due to construction work ahead is advised. Overall, cautious driving with full attention on the road is recommended until clear of the construction area."
