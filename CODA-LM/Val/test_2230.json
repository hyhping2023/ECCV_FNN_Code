        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several elements that the ego car must consider:\n\nFirstly, there is a silver sedan with its hazard lights on, stopped diagonally on the right side of the road, partially occupying the driving lane and facing the direction of the ego vehicle. This vehicle poses a potential hazard as it is obstructing part of the active driving lane, necessitating that the ego car maneuvers around it.\n\nSecondly, a dark-colored vehicle is directly ahead of the ego car, with its rear lights illuminated, which suggests it might be moving slowly or coming to a stop due to the situation ahead. The vehicle ahead may suddenly brake or change lanes, which requires the ego car to remain cautious and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is an oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane, with its headlights on, indicating it is approaching the ego car. The presence of this oncoming vehicle must be taken into account to ensure that any maneuvers around the obstacle are executed safely without encroaching into the oncoming traffic lane.\n\nLastly, there are reflections visible on the road, which could potentially be from water. These reflections suggest that there may be wet or slippery road conditions, and the ego car must drive carefully to account for this.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the scene."

Turn on hazard lights and pass the accident scene cautiously, watching for any people or objects that may be in the roadway. Observe for any directional guidance from traffic authorities if present. Prepare to navigate around the disabled vehicle ahead, ensuring to check the mirrors and blind spots for any vehicles in the lane to the left before changing lanes. Wait until the oncoming vehicle has passed before attempting any maneuvers that may encroach into the opposite lane. Continuous monitoring of the roadway's wet condition is needed to adjust speed accordingly and maintain safe stopping distances."
