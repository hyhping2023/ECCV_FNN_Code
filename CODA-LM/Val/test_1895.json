However, there is a vulnerable road user; a dog is observed crossing the road from left to right within the marked pedestrian crossing area. The presence of the animal on the road is a potential hazard as it is unpredictable and could cause the ego car to take evasive action to avoid a collision, ensuring the safety of both the animal and the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic lights in the scene are showing red for the direction the ego car is facing. There is also a countdown timer next to the pedestrian signal indicating that there are 35 seconds remaining before the light changes. This red traffic light requires the ego car to come to a complete stop before the intersection. The countdown timer provides the vehicle with information on when the lights are likely to change, allowing the driver to prepare for either a stop or a restart, depending on the situation.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

As the dog's behavior can be unpredictable, it is important to wait until the dog has safely crossed and the traffic light turns green before proceeding through the intersection. The driver should remain vigilant for any sudden movements from the animal in case it changes direction or another animal appears. Additional caution should be exercised since the visibility appears to be compromised, potentially due to weather conditions (rain or fog) or a dirty camera lens."
