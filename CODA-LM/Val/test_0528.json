        "description and explanation": "The current traffic scene includes a single vehicle and two traffic signs. The vehicle is an orange forklift, positioned at the edge of the intersection, and is partially extending into the right lane. It's placed perpendicular to the ego car's direction, near the curb. Its location on the road obstructs part of the right lane and poses a risk of unexpected movement, signaling the need for the ego car to exercise caution while approaching or passing.\n\nFurthermore, two traffic signs are present. The first is a no-entry sign located to the right side of the road, indicating the start of an access-restricted road. This means the ego vehicle must not proceed into the lane where this sign stands. The second sign is a speed limit sign mounted above the road, specifying a maximum permissible speed of 60 km/h. It is crucial for the ego car to adhere to this speed limit while driving through the area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
