        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, two key categories of road users merit attention. Firstly, we have a large red truck with a dirty, gray container that's raised in an upright position. This truck is situated a few car lengths ahead of the ego car and occupies the same lane. The unique position and orientation of the truck suggest it's either in the process of offloading or loading goods. This situation creates an obstruction within the ego car's path, necessitating a lane change to avoid any potential collision. Additionally, there's a white hatchback car positioned on the right side of the view, parallel to the ego car. Currently stationary, this vehicle does not pose an immediate threat. However, any sudden movement by the hatchback could affect the ego carâ€™s maneuverability, especially in light of the need to circumvent the container truck ahead."

These materials are stacked high and appear to be secured; however, due to their height, there is potential for obstructed visibility and risk of materials falling if not properly secured. When driving behind such a vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to provide ample time to react to any potential debris falling from the cargo area and to maintain clear visibility of the road ahead. Additionally, due to the size of the truck, the driver of the ego car should be cautious when considering overtaking, as it may take longer to pass safely.",

The driver should activate the left turn signal to indicate the intention to change lanes and watch for any movement from the parallel white hatchback car while performing the maneuver. If the left lane is not clear or a lane change is not safe, the ego car should come to a stop at a safe distance behind the truck and wait until it is possible to pass safely."
