A vehicle is parked on the right side of the road and is not easily noticeable due to low lighting conditions, creating a potential risk of collision for the ego car if it doesn't keep a safe distance. Further down, oncoming vehicles facing the ego car necessitate that it remains in its own lane and stay vigilant for any visibility impairments due to the headlight glare.\n\nNo vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present in the image, so they are not currently influencing the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nA traffic sign is visible to the right, but its details are indistinct. Consequently, the impact on the driving behavior is uncertain, and the driver should proceed with caution for potential hidden instructions or warnings.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in the scene, thus no influence from signal-controlled intersections is applicable here.\n\nNear the parked vehicle, there appears to be a barrier possibly made up of debris or construction materials, which may reduce the drivable area and the driver must maneuver carefully to avoid any obstruction. Alongside, miscellaneous objects are scattered close to the parked vehicle and barrier. Although they might present minor distractions or hazards, they do not drastically change the driving behavior unless they start obstructing the road."

When approaching a stationary vehicle at the side of the road, the driver of the ego car should reduce speed if necessary and watch for pedestrians or the possibility of the parked vehicle's doors opening or the vehicle pulling out into traffic.
