Close proximity requires careful monitoring in case the truck changes lanes or stops suddenly. The size and position of the mixer truck may influence the lane keeping and passing decisions of the ego car, requiring additional caution and potentially slowing down to maintain safe driving distance. The size and type of the truck suggest that it could make wide turns or decelerate unexpectedly due to its operating nature, affecting the traffic flow and requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance."

        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, the ego vehicle is sharing the road with a large white concrete mixer truck on its immediate left side, which is in motion as indicated by its blurry wheels. The presence of this truck is significant as it may limit the visibility and maneuverability of the ego car. The ego vehicle must carefully monitor the truck due to its close proximity, in case it changes lanes or stops suddenly. The truck's size and position influence the lane keeping and passing decisions of the ego car, necessitating additional caution and potentially a reduction in speed to maintain a safe driving distance. Given the nature of the truck's operation, it could make wide turns or decelerate unexpectedly, affecting the traffic flow and requiring the ego car to keep a safe distance.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle, so no specific action is required concerning these users. Similarly, there are no visible traffic signs indicating restrictions or warnings, no traffic cones, and no barriers obstructing the road, which means no immediate actions are needed based on these elements.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is green for the direction in which the ego car is traveling, authorizing it to proceed through the intersection or continue along the road without stopping. The ego car should remain ready to respond to potential changes in the traffic light, but for now, it is legal and safe to continue moving forward.\n\nLastly, there are no other objects such as debris, dustbins, or any obstructions visible on the road that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car, so no immediate action is required regarding these objects."

As the traffic light is green, the ego car can continue driving through the intersection or along the road, adhering to the speed limit and road conditions, ensuring to keep an eye on the road ahead for any unexpected changes or road users that may appear. Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck while monitoring its movements closely as it occupies part of the adjacent lane. Proceed with caution, given that large vehicles may need to make wide turns or change lanes unexpectedly. Since the traffic light is green, the ego vehicle should continue moving forward as planned but remain alert to the traffic light and surrounding traffic to adapt to any sudden changes. Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck, monitor its signals and actions for any turns or stops, and prepare to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car should proceed with caution, being aware of the traffic conditions ahead and any potential changes in the traffic light."
