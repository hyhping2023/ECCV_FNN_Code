The ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust its speed or come to a stop in response to the leading car's actions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a speed limit sign on the right side of the road indicating a maximum speed of 20 units, which sets the top speed the ego vehicle should not exceed under safe conditions.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is displaying a red signal, requiring the ego vehicle to come to a complete stop at the designated stopping point.\n\nReflective traffic cones are placed on either side of the lane, funneling traffic into a narrower path. The ego vehicle must navigate carefully within these constraints to stay within the drivable area.\n\nYellow reflective barriers are also present on both sides of the lane, signaling a narrowed road or construction works. These barriers direct the ego vehicle along a specific path and signal the need for caution due to potential changes in the road layout or the presence of obstacles.\n\nOther elements in the scene include street lights and possibly illuminated signage, which improve visibility but do not directly influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, as they do not convey regulatory information that affects immediate driving decisions."

Observe yellow barriers to ensure the ego car remains within the correct lane boundaries, and stay alert for any changes in the road conditions or additional signs that might inform about roadworks or detours."
