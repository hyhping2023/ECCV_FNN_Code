        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several vehicles and an object of interest that influence our autonomous driving behavior. To begin with, a white van has taken position directly ahead of our vehicle in the left lane, and has its brake lights illuminated, a clear sign that it is either decelerating or has already stopped. Consequently, our vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to decelerate or come to a halt if necessary. Additional vehicles are present both within our lane and the adjacent one, each at varying proximities. The presence of these vehicles necessitates that our vehicle stay vigilant and ready to adjust speed or stop as they might exhibit similar behaviors. There is also a white sedan parked on the far right-hand side; although it does not presently interfere with our course, it warrants observation for any sudden movements.\n\nBesides the vehicles, there is an object alongside the road—a yellow traffic barricade with reflective features—situated beside the right lane. The position and nature of the barricade suggest a no-parking zone adjacent to the driving lane, signaling to our vehicle to keep clear of that area. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this particular scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the white van ahead, and pay attention to its braking actions. Stay alert, as congestion may affect lane change decisions. Observe the traffic lights and be prepared to respond to signal changes. Carefully drive past yellow obstacles, being mindful of potential hazard areas or workers on the road. Keep a cautious speed, and be ready to slow down or change lanes if the white compact van encroaches on your lane. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, and always be aware of vehicles entering and exiting parking spaces. Proceed with caution at intersections, being aware that the green light may change, and watch for any unexpected behaviors from other road users.",
