The proximity and size of the truck may obstruct the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead, requiring caution and readiness to brake or change lanes if necessary."

The positions and movements of these vehicles may affect lane choice and merging decisions for the ego car."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, the ego car is following a large truck with reflective markings that's directly in its lane and moving in the same direction. The rear lights of the truck are on, which indicates that the truck may be slowing down or stopping, and thus, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance because the truck's size and position obstruct the car's view of the road ahead. This necessitates cautious driving and preparedness for any sudden changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are various vehicles in the lanes to the left side of the ego car, recognizable only by their tail lights, which suggests nighttime or low-visibility conditions. These vehicles are proceeding in the same direction as the ego car and may affect decisions regarding lane changes or merging, as they have the potential to change lanes themselves.\n\nIn the distance, above the truck, a traffic light displaying a green signal can be seen. Although the light is currently green, allowing the traffic to proceed, the ego car must remain alert to the possibility of the light changing and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nOn the left side of the road, barriers are present, indicating the likelihood of construction or a restricted area. This implies there may be road work ahead, necessitating potential lane shifts or merges by the ego vehicle.\n\nLastly, there is glare on the windshield caused by various light sources, which could impair visibility. This glare presents an additional driving challenge as it might make it difficult to see hazards on the road, requiring the driver to exercise increased vigilance."

Monitor the traffic light to anticipate any changes and be prepared to stop if it turns yellow or red. Reduce speed if necessary to accommodate reduced visibility due to glare and watch for any hazards that may not be immediately visible. Monitor the surrounding vehicles, especially those in the left lane, for any sudden lane changes. Stay alert for any traffic light changes that could affect the current lane and prepare to stop if the lights switch to yellow or red. Watch for signals from vehicles in adjacent lanes to anticipate and react to potential merges or lane changes. Observe the area around the barriers for workers or additional instructions. Continue driving while being prepared to adjust speed or lane position in response to the road users and traffic infrastructure."
