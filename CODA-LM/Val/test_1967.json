Monitoring this truck is critical due to its large size and the potential for sudden stops or falling debris, which could influence the following distance and speed adjustments of the ego vehicle. The immediate area lacks specific traffic signs that would alter standard road practices, signifying the default rules are in effect. There is a green traffic light ahead which indicates that the ego vehicle can proceed without the need to stop, but it should remain vigilant for any light changes that may require it to halt. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene that need to be considered in the current driving scenario."

This vehicle is designed to perform tasks related to construction, such as moving heavy materials or aiding in building infrastructure. The presence of construction vehicles on the road can indicate nearby road work or construction sites. For an autonomous vehicle, encountering such a vehicle might require increased caution and awareness of potential obstructions or altered traffic patterns. The ego car should monitor the vehicle's movements and prepare to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to maintain safety and comply with any road work signage or directions.",

Be alert for any signs or signals as the ego car progresses on the road. If necessary and safe, prepare to change lanes to overtake the truck if it is traveling below the speed limit or if maintaining a safe following distance becomes difficult. Continue to monitor the road for any changes in traffic conditions or additional road users. Since the traffic light state is green, the ego car should continue at the current speed but be prepared to adjust if the traffic light changes or the truck's behavior indicates a need to do so. Always be ready to slow down or stop if necessary, taking into account the large vehicle's longer stopping distance."
