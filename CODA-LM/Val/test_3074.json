Its purpose is to guide vehicles by demarcating areas that are not to be entered or to signal caution due to road work or other temporary obstructions. In this scenario, its presence suggests drivers should steer clear of that portion of the road and it may indicate a closed lane or potential hazards ahead, consequently influencing the ego car to adjust its course to maintain a safe pathway and avert the marked area.",

No swift or unexpected maneuvers should be taken, and attention should be on the lookout for any supplementary instructions or changes to the road conditions. The ego car should slow down due to the wet road conditions to maintain control."
