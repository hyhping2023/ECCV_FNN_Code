These large vehicles may obstruct the view of the ego car and suggest potential construction activity that could affect road conditions. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance to avoid potential hazards as these vehicles partially block the road and limit maneuvering space. Additionally, various commercial vehicles and trucks are parked parallel to the road on the left side. The ego car should be cautious as these vehicles might enter the traffic flow or have people moving around them. Furthermore, a white car is parked on the right side of the road just beyond the construction vehicles, which narrows the usable space and could be a hazard if passengers exit the vehicle. Although the parked car does not pose an immediate danger, it could potentially move into the traffic flow. There are no traffic cones, barriers, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects visible in the scene."

Maintain a vigilant speed, giving ample space when passing the parked construction vehicles and the parked white car. Keep an eye on the parked white car for any indication it might enter the traffic flow and be ready to react accordingly. Monitor the environment for any traffic signs or signals that might be obstructed from view by the construction vehicles. Stay vigilant for any temporary traffic signs or workers that could indicate construction activities ahead. If there are any indications of road work or obstructions, be prepared to stop or yield as required."
