Keep a lookout for any signals from the vehicles, like brake lights or turn signals, that could indicate their intent to slow down, stop, or change lanes. Due to reduced visibility, lower your speed and stay alert for any unpredictable movements from other vehicles. Maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, providing ample space for braking due to the wet road conditions. Avoid any abrupt lane changes or maneuvers."
