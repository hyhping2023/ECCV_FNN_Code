These vehicles might change speed or lanes, influencing the ego car's trajectory and speed. Additionally, there's a blue car on the right, either parked or moving slowly, which could merge into traffic, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust its speed or change lanes. There is also a parked scooter near the bike lane, which, although stationary, should be monitored for potential movement.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: A group of cyclists is riding in a designated bike lane on the right side, moving parallel to traffic. These cyclists might change lanes or face difficulties requiring them to enter the vehicle lane, necessitating careful attention and maintaining a safe distance by the ego car.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: Directional road signs overhead indicate lanes for different routes, requiring the ego car to potentially change lanes according to its navigation plan. A blue circular sign on the right denotes a bike lane, reminding that cyclists are expected in this area and the ego car should exercise caution when maneuvering near this lane.\n\n- **Barriers**: Metal guardrails on the right side separate the bicycle lane from the roadway, ensuring the safety of cyclists.\n\n- **Other Objects**: Alongside the road, there are stationary objects such as trees, bushes, and street lights. These are part of the peripheral environment that an autonomous system must recognize, even though they do not directly impact the driving path.\n\nNo traffic lights or traffic cones are visible in the image, thus these elements do not influence current driving decisions."

Monitor the red car ahead in the center lane and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary. Pay close attention to the parked scooter on the right in case it becomes a moving obstacle. Finally, stay vigilant for the cyclists in the bike lane and do not cross into their lane; observe the physical barrier and the road signs indicating the presence of the bike lane, respecting the space of the cyclists."
