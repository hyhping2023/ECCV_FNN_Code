If the bus's behavior hinders traffic, it may also be necessary to change lanes, and attention should be given to pedestrians or other vehicles in the vicinity that may not be immediately visible."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, we have a cement mixer truck located directly ahead of our position. This truck is quite large, and the fact that its mixing drum is in operation and the brake lights are lit suggests it might slow down or come to a stop. Consequently, maintaining a safe distance from this truck is crucial as the situation requires preparedness for possible changes in speed or stopping.\n\nThere's also a bus to our vehicle's right side, appearing to be in motion and potentially ready to halt, which could disrupt traffic flow. Notably, part of the bus extends into the next lane, which could obscure the view. The uncertain behavior of the bus necessitates careful driving, as abrupt stops or delays can occur. It might also be necessary to change lanes if the bus disrupts the flow of traffic; therefore, extra attention should be paid to spotting any pedestrians or other vehicles that could be temporarily hidden from view.\n\nFurthermore, a cyclist is riding in the bike lane on the left side of our vehicle. Operating in parallel to our direction of movement and remaining on the edge of the road, the presence of the cyclist must be carefully considered. Autonomous vehicles are expected to be cautious, ensure they do not intrude into the bike lane, watch for any potential swerving of the cyclist into the traffic lane, and provide ample space when passing the cyclist.\n\nNo other categories, including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the image according to the provided data, thus no summary for those elements is needed."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer in front of you that may be slowing down or coming to a stop, and be ready to respond to its possible left turn or lane change. Be aware of the bus on the right, which may interrupt the flow of traffic and potentially block your view. Monitor cyclists to ensure they do not drift into the lane, and stay vigilant at traffic lights, proceeding with caution due to the presence of heavy vehicles. If you need to change lanes, make sure to do so safely and without interfering with cyclists. Pay attention to any sudden movements of the bus on the right. Be aware of the approach of cyclists as well; once the intersection is clear and the traffic light permits, cautiously and safely overtake them.",
