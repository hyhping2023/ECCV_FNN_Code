These parked vehicles restrict the driving path, necessitating the ego car to proceed with caution to prevent mishaps related to unexpected door openings or pedestrians that may emerge from between the cars.\n\nAdditionally, a potential hazard is present in the form of a small dog standing in the middle of the road, facing the direction of the ego car. This dog could move unpredictably, so the autonomous vehicle needs to be ready to either stop or undertake evasive action to avoid an accident.\n\nLastly, the road is littered with debris, predominantly on the right-hand side, which could potentially be a hazard or cause damage to the vehicle. The ego car is advised to stay clear of this litter by maintaining a safe distance and steering away from these objects when possible."
