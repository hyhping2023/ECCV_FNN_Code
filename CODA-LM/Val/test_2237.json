Additionally, there is a 'No Entry' sign for the lanes on the left, indicating that those lanes are closed or not to be entered, which restricts the ego vehicle's lane choices and requires the driver to use only the permitted lanes.\n\nFurthermore, there are two red traffic lights at the intersection directly in front of the ego car, signaling that the ego car must stop and wait for the lights to turn green before proceeding. Orange traffic cones are aligned on the right side of the road, indicating some form of road work or lane closure, which may result in a reduced lane width or a diversion that the ego car must navigate around. Alongside the cones, there is a temporary barrier wall to the left, likely delineating construction or a blocked-off area, reinforcing the coned-off area and confirming that the ego car needs to navigate around this space. There are no vulnerable road users, other objects, or additional barriers or traffic signs mentioned in the scene."
