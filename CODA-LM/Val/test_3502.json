        "other objects": [],
        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, various road users and objects are present, influencing the driving behavior of the ego car. Starting with vehicles, a yellow car is noted on the right side of the road moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this car demands readiness from the ego vehicle to react to possible sudden stops or maneuvers that could compromise safety. On the left, a row of parked cars poses potential hazards by possibly obstructing the view of the road and the risk of car doors opening or pedestrians stepping out unexpectedly. Additionally, several construction vehicles and a bus are spotted behind roadside barriers to the left, signaling ongoing construction activities. Though these vehicles do not impact the ego car's immediate path, they indicate potential road work, requiring vigilance for unexpected conditions or workers. A white van, either parked or moving slowly, followed by other vehicles on the right, could block the lane or shift into the ego car's path, necessitating caution and possibly a lane change.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, multiple pedestrians are seen to the right, with some walking alongside the road and another crossing it. This scenario dictates that the ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop to avoid any hazard they might present. A cyclist is also seen ahead on the right, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The likelihood of the cyclist changing direction or stumbling upon road obstacles requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to adjust its path.\n\nConcerning traffic management, traffic cones are placed on the left, signaling road work or lane closures. These cones imply potential disruptions to normal traffic flow, such as narrowed lanes or the presence of workers on the road, urging the ego car to navigate with additional caution. Blue barriers also line the left side of the road, associated with construction or road maintenance. These barriers are indicative of possible changes to lane availability and impose the need for the ego car to stay alert to lane shifts or merges.\n\nOverall, the traffic scene comprises a mix of moving and stationary vehicles, vulnerable road users, and roadwork indicators, all of which collectively suggest a complex driving environment requiring heightened awareness and readiness to respond to various potential hazards."
