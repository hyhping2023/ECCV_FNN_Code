    "driving_suggestion": "When driving your own vehicle, proceed with caution and maintain a safe speed to prepare for the appearance of forklifts and workers. If necessary, be ready to change lanes to the left, and always give way to road workers. Pay attention to any additional signs or signals related to construction or road work. Drive carefully through construction zones. Slow down and be prepared to stop or maneuver around forklifts that become obstacles. Stay alert for workers and any unexpected movements, and keep a safe distance. Continue to monitor traffic lights, making sure they are still green as you approach intersections.",
