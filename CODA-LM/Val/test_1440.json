It has a clearly visible carriage number and is traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. This vehicleâ€™s presence affects our driving route and speed, requiring us to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or speed changes.\n\nA continuous green construction barrier is set up along the right side of the road, restricting passage. This signifies an area under construction or closed off to traffic, narrowing the available roads and necessitating driving within the marked lanes.\n\nAdditionally, construction debris and uneven terrain are visible to the left of the traffic cone. This debris could cause damage or unexpected changes in trajectory, so the vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the left side."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, observing its signal and brake lights to understand changes in speed or sudden stops. Stay close to the center of the lane to keep a safe distance from the green construction barriers. Due to the narrowing of the lane and the lack of clear markings, drive cautiously and be prepared to stop or slow down at any time to respond to the movement of construction vehicles or potential traffic coming from the opposite direction. Remain vigilant for people near the roadside to prevent them from stepping onto the road and ensure safe passage.",

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle is present on the road ahead. The vehicle appears to be heavy and sturdy, possibly engaged in transport or construction work, indicated by the robust design and build. The presence of this vehicle influences the ego car's future driving behavior by signaling the need for an increased following distance to maintain a safe stopping gap. Caution should be exercised as construction vehicles can make sudden stops or slow maneuvers. Anticipating potential movements of the construction vehicle, such as turning or backing up, is also important for safe driving.",
