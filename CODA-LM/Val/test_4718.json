                "explanation": "The RV's position might obstruct the lane and reduce visibility for the ego car, particularly of any other road users that might be obscured by the large vehicle. Additionally, the RV partially on the road has the potential to initiate movement, which could affect maneuverability."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene before us, there are two notable elements within the vehicles category:\n\nFirstly, we observe a white recreational vehicle (RV) parked on the right-hand side of the road, occupying a portion of the lane closest to the curb. This RV is positioned in such a way that it may obstruct the lane and obscure the line of sight for the ego vehicle, particularly due to its large size. The presence of the RV requires the ego car to be vigilant and prepared to adjust its route, considering that the RV could potentially start moving and influence the available maneuverability on the road.\n\nSecondly, a number of vehicles are parked in a line just beyond the aforementioned RV, with additional cars partially visible further down the road, all parked on the right side and facing the same direction as the ego car. Having multiple vehicles parked along the street has the potential to narrow the drivable area, and thus, there's a risk that vehicles may pull out from their parked spots or that people might exit these vehicles. The ego car needs to be aware of these hazards, especially wary of the likelihood of car doors opening or pedestrians crossing between the parked vehicles.\n\nNo other road users, including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the given scene, indicating that there are no notable elements in these categories affecting the driving environment for the ego vehicle at this moment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the parked RV on the right to allow for maneuvering space if needed. Be vigilant for movement from parked vehicles and maintain a lower speed to react accordingly. The ego car should also prepare for the possibility of reduced lane width ahead due to ongoing parking on the right side, and remain vigilant for other road users that might not be immediately visible. The absence of visible traffic signs and lights indicates that the road may be a lower-speed area with potential for vehicles and pedestrians, so adjust speed and attention accordingly."
