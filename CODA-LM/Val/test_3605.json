Some of these vehicles have their tail lights on, indicating that they may be occupied or about to move. The fact that these vehicles are stationary along the side of the road means that there is reduced space available for maneuvering. This situation requires extra caution, as there is a risk associated with the possibility of a car door opening suddenly or one of the parked vehicles pulling out into the flow of traffic unexpectedly."

The presence of this car influences driving behavior significantly. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from this vehicle to avoid collisions, especially in low-light conditions where reaction times may be affected. Additionally, the ego car should prepare to react to the car's potential maneuvers, such as turning or braking suddenly.",

Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles and be prepared for any unexpected movements from them. Drive cautiously to safely navigate through the low visibility area and parked vehicles on the side. Proceed with caution due to low visibility and the potential for hidden hazards, including the presence of the parked car on the right. Reduce speed and increase following distance to allow more reaction time. Use appropriate lighting to improve visibility without dazzling other road users. Be prepared to stop if necessary."
