Drivers are advised to remain cautious, paying attention to the potential movements of these vehicles and keeping a safe distance to prevent any accidents.\n\nAdditionally, bright yellow barriers can be seen prominently placed in the middle and along the sides of the road. This set-up serves to guide the flow of traffic by providing a clear separation. The presence of these barriers indicates that there might be a road closure, possibly due to construction or similar activities, necessitating that autonomous vehicles find an alternative route to avoid the section of the road demarcated by the barriers."

When preparing to stop at a red light ahead, be vigilant of any sudden movements by the parked vehicles and ensure safe navigation around obstacles and traffic cones. Adjust the speed and following distance according to the slippery road conditions. Your vehicle should also observe any changes in signals or road layout due to construction or other alterations.",
