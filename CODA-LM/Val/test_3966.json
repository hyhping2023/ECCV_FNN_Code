        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene includes a yield sign situated on the right side of the road at an upcoming junction. The sign is triangular with a flat bottom, featuring a white and red color scheme, and stands out against the background. The presence of this sign indicates that drivers must be ready to stop if necessary to allow other drivers from different approaches to continue. It warns of potential crossing traffic and emphasizes the need for the ego car to be prepared to slow down and give way to other vehicles at the junction, to ensure a safe merge.\n\nAdditionally, there is an arrangement of traffic cones on the right side of the road, forming a taper indicating a lane closure or obstruction ahead. This setup suggests that there may be roadwork or a hazard off the direct pathway, signaling vehicles to adjust their lane position away from the cones. The cones imply that the right lane may be merging into the left or there is a potential hazard, thereby necessitating the ego car to possibly change lanes or proceed with caution when passing the area.\n\nLastly, there are permanent concrete barriers installed on both sides of the road. These barriers delineate the driving path and prevent the vehicle from straying off the ramp or encroaching into the lanes designated for oncoming traffic."

Given the presence of a yield sign, the ego car should prepare to slow down and yield to any oncoming traffic at the junction. Additionally, due to the traffic cones indicating a lane closure or obstruction ahead, the ego car should stay alert and merge to the left if safe to do so. The ego car should also navigate the curve at an appropriate speed that ensures safety and lane discipline. The vehicle should also be cautious of the traffic cones and be prepared to merge left if necessary. Constant vigilance is required due to the nighttime conditions that can reduce visibility of unexpected obstacles."
