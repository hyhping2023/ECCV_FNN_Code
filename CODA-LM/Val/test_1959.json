Additionally, there are moving vehicles ahead of the ego car in the same direction, indicating the traffic flow and speed that the ego car should maintain. On the opposite side of a median, vehicles are facing the opposite direction, although they don't directly influence the ego car's immediate driving behavior, their presence necessitates general awareness of the overall traffic situation.\n\nA dog is crossing the road from left to right in the foreground, posing a potential hazard due to its unpredictability. This necessitates the ego car to slow down or stop to avoid a collision.\n\nA 'No Parking' sign is visible on the right side of the road, above the parked cars. This implies that the parked cars may be temporary or unlawfully parked, requiring the ego car to remain cautious of potentially moving vehicles.\n\nA green traffic light is visible ahead, indicating that the ego car has the right of way to proceed through the intersection. However, due to the presence of the dog, caution is still advised.\n\nMetal barriers are located on the right side, separating the sidewalk from the road, thus marking the boundary between driving and pedestrian areas without directly influencing the ego carâ€™s immediate behavior unless moved onto the road. Additionally, a continuous median barrier separates the oncoming lanes of traffic from the ego car's lane, serving to keep the ego car within its current lane and prevent crossing into oncoming traffic."

Also, keep an eye on the parked cars on the right for doors opening or vehicles pulling out into traffic. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Maintain awareness of the road conditions and reduced traction, prepare to slow down or stop due to the dog's proximity to the road, monitor the green light for changes, and keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Continue scanning the environment for any new road users or changes that may affect driving behavior."
