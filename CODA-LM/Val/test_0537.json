        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are a few noteworthy road users which play an essential role in the decision-making process for autonomous driving systems. Primarily, the vehicles category comprises two distinct situations. First, there's a large vehicle, such as a truck or bus, spotted ahead in the right lane. This vehicle's red taillights are visible, indicating that it is currently in motion. The presence and movement of this large vehicle significantly influence the ego car's ability to perform maneuvers such as overtaking or changing lanes. It's vital for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle for safety reasons. Secondly, several vehicles are observed directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. These vehicles all have their tail lights on, signifying active traffic conditions. The behavior of these vehicles, including any sudden braking, directly impacts the ego car's speed and following distance. The ego car needs to adjust its speed accordingly and be prepared for any necessary stops, based on the flow of traffic and the actions of these vehicles ahead.\n\nAside from vehicles, the other notable observation in the traffic scene is related to 'other objects'. Specifically, a potential hazard identified is debris or a small object located on the right side of the lane. This object could pose a risk of obstruction. To ensure safety, the ego car may need to execute a lane change or maneuver to avoid this object, assuming it is safe to perform such an action.\n\nThe data does not include any mention of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers within this particular traffic image, suggesting that these categories are not applicable or present in the observed scene. The attention, therefore, focuses on managing safe distances and speeds around vehicles and recognizing and responding to potential obstacles like debris on the road."

Its presence requires the driver to be cautious and possibly make a slight adjustment to the vehicle's path if necessary to avoid running over it, especially if it contains harmful materials or objects that could cause tire damage or other vehicle issues. It is essential to maintain a safe distance from such obstacles to ensure the safety of the vehicle and other road users.",

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the small object on the road to determine if a lane change is necessary to avoid it safely. Use headlights appropriately to ensure visibility is maximized without blinding other drivers."
