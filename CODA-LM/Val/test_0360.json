        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a pedestrian positioned on the right side of the road, close to the guardrail. This individual appears to be either awaiting the opportunity to cross the street or operating the controls for a railway crossing. Due to their dark attire, their visibility is reduced, especially at night. For safety, the autonomous vehicle should be prepared to alter its course of action if the pedestrian begins to cross, which may necessitate a reduction in speed or coming to a complete halt.\n\nAdditionally, there is a level crossing barrier located to the right, currently in a raised position, signifying that vehicles can proceed. However, caution is advised since the barrier's descent would indicate an approaching train, requiring vehicles to stop.\n\nTraffic cones are present ahead on the right, designating a separation or an area that should be avoided. These cones suggest that the autonomous vehicle should steer clear of this marked territory, possibly slow down, and be ready to either stop or adjust its trajectory if needed.\n\nFurthermore, there are barriers installed on the right side of the road. One set is highlighted with reflective strips to enhance visibility, indicating it is a boundary not to be crossed, guiding vehicles to stay on the intended path. Another set of barriers suggests a construction zone or a division from a pedestrian area near a railway crossing. This scenario implies that the vehicle should keep away from the right side to foresee any possible shifts in road conditions or unexpected pedestrian movements."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to nighttime conditions, this vehicle should proceed with caution, ensuring the road ahead is clear and adhering to lane markings and obstacles. When the green light is on, the vehicle may continue without stopping, but vigilance should be maintained in case unexpected obstacles appear or traffic light status changes. It is advisable to maintain a moderate speed for safe reaction to changing conditions. When approaching pedestrian crossings and railway level crossings, slow down and prepare to stop in case railway barriers begin to lower or pedestrians step onto the road. Be aware of changes in road conditions due to obstacles and potential construction signs. Maintain a moderate speed and pay close attention to pedestrians on the right, ready to stop if they enter the roadway. Stay within the marked driving lanes, keep a distance from traffic cones, and be prepared for any changes in passageway areas, such as the lowering of level crossing barriers, which would require stopping.",
