A white car is parked to the right of the ego vehicle, with its nose pointing in a direction perpendicular to the ego vehicle. This parked vehicle does not pose an immediate dynamic threat but reduces the available road width, requiring the ego vehicle to ensure sufficient clearance when passing.\n  2. A dark-colored car is visible on the right side of the ego vehicle, positioned perpendicular to the direction of travel. This indicates that the car may be in a parking lot or at the edge of a driveway, necessitating caution when moving.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  A metal fence is blocking the road ahead in the current lane. This obstacle indicates that the road ahead is impassable, and the vehicle must find an alternative route.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this image."
