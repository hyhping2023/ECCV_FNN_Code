A white car is traveling in the same direction as our car in the right lane, about five car lengths ahead. This vehicle sets the safe following distance and speed that our vehicle should maintain.\n2. A gray SUV is driving parallel to and in the same direction as the white car in the right lane. Our vehicle must be prepared to react if the SUV decides to change lanes.\n3. A red car is driving parallel to our car in the right lane. Our vehicle must also watch out for this red car in case it decides to change lanes.\n4. Several vehicles are parked parallel to the driving lane on the right side of the road. Drivers should be cautious of the potential for car doors to open suddenly or pedestrians moving between these parked vehicles.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. Workers are present on the roadside to the right, within a designated work area. Their presence necessitates cautious driving and reducing speed to ensure safety.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. A yellow diamond-shaped sign with a black symbol on the right indicates road construction ahead. It alerts the driver to be aware of potential workers or equipment near the driving lanes.\n2. A pedestrian crossing sign accompanied by a warning triangle sign is visible on the right side of the road. These signs warn the driver of potential pedestrian crossings and indicate possible road construction or obstacles ahead, requiring reduced speed and increased vigilance.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. A traffic cone with yellow and red stripes is placed on the right side, forming a barrier between the lane and the construction area. These cones signify lane reductions or alterations due to the work zone, necessitating lane discipline.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. Physical barriers are present between the sidewalk and the roads on both sides. These obstacles ensure the self-driving vehicle stays within its lane and provide a safe space for pedestrians away from moving vehicles.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n1. Near the traffic cone on the right side, there are various construction or maintenance materials and tools. Drivers must remain vigilant as these materials could accidentally end up on the road, posing potential dangers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead, monitor the gray SUV and the possible lane changes of the red car on the right. Due to the presence of workers and upcoming road construction signs, be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, and be vigilant for parked cars and possible pedestrian activity. Continuously monitor the proximity of road workers to the driving lanes to ensure that necessary adjustments can be made in a timely manner. Obey any posted speed limits, exercise caution when passing through the work zone, and ensure that the self-driving car's sensors are adjusted to bright conditions to prevent glare from affecting their performance.",
