This van may obstruct the lane and reduce the visibility of our vehicle, potentially requiring a lane change or a reduction in speed to safely navigate around it.\n  - There is a dark-colored van parked perpendicularly to our vehicle on the front left side. Although stationary, it occupies part of the road, making a lane change or adjustment of the driving path necessary to avoid it.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - Several pedestrians are at the right edge of the lane. These pedestrians approaching the roadway necessitate caution and readiness to stop or slow down to prevent any accidents if they step onto the driving path.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Construction debris or obstacles are present on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane. These obstacles require a lane change or reducing speed to safely navigate around them.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - There may be dust or smoke in the air, reducing visibility. This reduction in visibility can impact the vehicle's sensors in detecting obstacles and other road users, necessitating adjustments in driving to ensure safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "When approaching the parked van and construction area, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to navigate carefully around them. It is crucial to closely monitor pedestrians, maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead (including the dark-colored van on the left), and be ready to stop suddenly if necessary. Due to changes in air quality and the activities of construction workers or other road users (such as motorcyclists), it may be necessary to adjust your driving route. If possible, consider finding an alternative route to completely avoid the construction area.",

The presence of these debris could pose a hazard to vehicles traveling along this lane. The ego car must reduce speed and maneuver to avoid the debris to prevent potential damage to the vehicle or loss of control. If it is not possible to navigate safely around the debris, the ego car should come to a safe stop and await removal of the obstruction or further instructions from traffic management authorities.",
