The presence of this parked car reduces the available road space and may obstruct the view of any pedestrians or animals that could potentially enter the road, necessitating cautious driving behavior from our vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the surroundings are marked by numerous telegraph poles and wires on both sides of the road. While these structures do not directly impact driving, they suggest that the area is residential or under development, which typically involves higher pedestrian activity and a greater likelihood of animals or other vehicles unexpectedly entering the road. Consequently, this environmental context calls for increased vigilance and a reduction in speed to safely navigate potential unforeseen circumstances."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of pedestrians and animals on the road, the vehicle should immediately slow down to ensure their safe passage. Caution should also be exercised when approaching vehicles that are parked ahead, in case they suddenly start moving or someone emerges from them. Given the potential for obstructions due to the narrowness of the road, the vehicle should maintain a lower speed overall and be ready to make an emergency stop or change direction at any time. Maintain a low speed and proceed with caution, in order to react to the movements of animals. Keep a safe distance from parked vehicles and animals, and be prepared to stop at any moment, in case animals block the way. Pay attention to road conditions and avoid sudden or sharp turns to prevent losing control on potentially slippery surfaces.",
