These parked vehicles reduce the navigable width of the roadway, requiring the ego car to maneuver carefully and stay alert for unexpected movements such as doors opening or pedestrians stepping out from between the vehicles.\n\nA traffic sign is observed on the right side of the road, though its information is not clear due to low-light conditions and distance. As a result, the ego car must proceed with caution until the sign's information can be understood.\n\nAdditionally, no traffic lights are discernible in the image. This absence suggests that traffic control might be either absent or not functioning in this stretch of road, necessitating that the ego car proceed with caution."

The ego car should be prepared to make adjustments to the driving path to navigate around the parked vehicles while ensuring not to enter the opposite lane prematurely, as there could be oncoming traffic not visible in the image."
