This truck is stationary and impacts the immediate driving path of our vehicle, requiring a stop or a lane change to avoid a collision. Additionally, on the distant right side of the road, there is a person riding a bicycle in the same direction as our vehicle. The presence of this cyclist means that autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to slow down or change lanes to ensure they do not interfere with the cyclist's route. Furthermore, a green garbage bin is placed on the sidewalk to the right side of the road, in front of the white truck. While the trash can does not obstruct vehicle traffic, it signifies the presence of pedestrian facilities in the area, which may lead to increased foot traffic. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the parked white truck and be prepared to move slightly to the left within the lane to avoid it. Meanwhile, the vehicle should be aware of pedestrians possibly entering the road due to obstacles. As the status of the traffic light is unclear, the vehicle should approach cautiously, ready to stop or continue driving based on the actual traffic signal observed upon approaching. Given the current situation, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop for vehicles turning ahead. Ensure a safe passing distance for cyclists on the road and stay alert to changes in the behavior of pedestrians near parked vehicles or garbage bins. Drive carefully, maintain a safe distance from the parked truck, and watch out for garbage bins. Watch for oncoming traffic and comply with the traffic signals. If traffic conditions are clear and safe, the vehicle can continue to move at a speed suitable for the current conditions, and remain vigilant for any unexpected actions from other road users or changes in traffic signals.",
