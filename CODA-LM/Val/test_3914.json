The ego car must prepare to slow down or stop to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a military truck is in the right lane, ahead of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. Caution is necessary when overtaking it, due to its larger size and potential for slower movement or unexpected lane changes.

Although not currently in the driving lane, the cyclist should be monitored for any sudden movements into the ego carâ€™s driving path.\n\nNo traffic signs are visible in this image. However, the use of brake lights suggests the possibility of a traffic control device ahead, indicating the ego car should be prepared to stop if a traffic light is red.\n\nYellow traffic cones are placed to the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating a lane narrowing or merging ahead. This requires the ego car to remain in the current lane and prepare for a potentially tighter traffic environment and merging with other traffic.\n\nBarrier cones are positioned at the center of the road, creating a separation between the lanes and dictating the available lanes for the ego vehicle, preventing any crossing over into oncoming traffic lanes.

Be cautious when approaching the military truck, and do not attempt to overtake unless it is safe and legal to do so. Keep an eye on the cyclist to ensure they do not move into the travel path of the ego vehicle. Adhere to the lane divisions as dictated by the central barrier cones, and prepare to make any necessary lane changes with caution and proper signaling. Continue to drive cautiously around the concrete barriers, staying within the lane markings and being aware of the limited maneuverability to the right. No overtakes should be attempted due to the potential obstruction of view and the narrowing lane caused by the traffic cones."
