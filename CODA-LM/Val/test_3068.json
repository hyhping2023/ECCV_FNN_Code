        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under observation, various road users and objects are visible which could influence the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle known as the ego car.\n\nFirstly, several cars are parked on the right side of the road with their brake lights off, indicative of being inactive. These are positioned in a dimly lit area, reducing the width of the driving lane available to the ego car. This situation also has the potential to obstruct the view of possible hazards like other vehicles attempting to pull out or pedestrians trying to cross the street.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is noted in the distance, on the right side, displaying a green light. This suggests it is legal and safe for the ego car to proceed through the intersection at this moment. However, the presence of the green light demands continued vigilance from the ego car for any rapid changes or disregard of traffic rules by other road users which could pose unexpected dangers.\n\nAnother observation includes points of light which could result in glare or reflections, posing challenges to visibility. Such conditions can distract the driver and substantially increase the risk of not spotting hazards timely.\n\nThese conditions in the traffic scene collectively impact the navigation and decision-making processes necessary for the safe operation of the ego vehicle in this environment."

Maintain a slower speed to account for potential slippery roads or sudden obstacles. Use low beams to reduce glare and increase visibility without affecting other road users. Constantly scan the road for any additional hazards that may not be immediately visible. Due to low visibility, the ego car should reduce its speed and increase following distance to react to any potential hazards that may emerge suddenly from the parked cars. The headlights should be fully active, and the car should be prepared to stop if any unseen hazards, such as pedestrians or other road users, enter the roadway unexpectedly. Proceed with caution due to low visibility and potential icy road conditions. Maintain a safe distance from the parked cars on the right to allow room for any unforeseen actions from them or pedestrians that may not be visible at the moment. Observe the green traffic light and proceed through the intersection if it remains green, but prepare to stop if it changes. Adjust speed to account for potentially slippery road conditions and perform any maneuvers smoothly to avoid skidding."
