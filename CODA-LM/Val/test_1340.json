        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are two notable categories of road users and structures visible.\n\nFirstly, there is a heavy vehicle, resembling a crane or an engineering vehicle, occupying the right lane and moving in the same direction as our vehicle. It is located slightly ahead and to the side. Its significant size and potentially slower speed are factors that may influence the flow of traffic. As a result, there may be a need for vehicles, including our autonomous car, to change lanes in order to pass the heavy vehicle safely and maintain smooth traffic flow.\n\nSecondly, there are a few cars visible in the opposite lane, driving towards our vehicle. These oncoming vehicles require careful monitoring to confirm that they remain within their lanes, maintaining safe passage and reducing the risk of a potential head-on collision.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there are metal guardrails installed along both sides of the road. These serve as barriers, delineating the motorized from the non-motorized vehicle areas, and segregating vehicles from potential hazard zones. It is critical for vehicles to stay within the travel lanes demarcated by these guardrails to avoid any accidents.\n\nApart from these two categories, other potential elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this given scenario, hence there is no need to consider them in the driving behavior at this moment."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front and be prepared to slow down if necessary. Stay alert to potential lane changes by the vehicle and adjust your speed or change lanes if needed. Keep a steady speed with the traffic flow and continue to monitor the situation, especially watching for roadside obstacles that may limit space for emergency maneuvers. Ensure you remain within the lane markings to avoid unsafe situations with oncoming traffic or roadside obstacles. Keep observing trucks and other oncoming vehicles while staying in your current lane, maintaining a safe following distance from any vehicle ahead. If the truck starts to move or any other potential danger arises, be ready to slow down or change lanes. Pay attention to any road signs or traffic signals ahead that might require you to adjust your driving.",

This vehicle can significantly influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior as it likely moves slower than regular traffic and may make wide turns or unexpected maneuvers due to its operational needs. The ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or reduced speeds when approaching or passing this vehicle.",
