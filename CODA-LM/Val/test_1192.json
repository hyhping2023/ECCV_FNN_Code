The SUV's brake lights indicate that it is either slowing down or stopped, which requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to stop as needed. \n\nTo the right and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, there is a motorcyclist moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the motorcyclist, who could be particularly vulnerable, necessitates that the ego vehicle stay vigilant for any abrupt changes in the motorcyclist's direction or speed.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is observed to the right of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. Since cyclists can behave unpredictably and may alter their direction or position, it is important for the ego car to carefully monitor the cyclist's movements.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the left, pedestrians can be seen, one of whom looks like they might step off the curb. Despite the fact that the pedestrians are not on the street, the ego car should stay alert just in case one of them unexpectedly enters the road.\n\nAbove the intersection, the traffic light is green for the direction the ego car is traveling. The ego car is granted permission to continue by the green light signal, but it should do so with caution, particularly because of the stationary vehicles and the cyclist.\n\nOther elements in the scene include a billboard and streetlight poles. These items are part of the usual roadside setting and do not have a direct impact on the driving behavior of the ego car."
