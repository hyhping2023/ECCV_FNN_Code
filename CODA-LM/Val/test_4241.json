        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is one notable vehicle—a large truck—that is directly ahead of the autonomous vehicle, within the same lane. The rear view of the truck is visible, showcasing red and white reflective markings that help identify it as a larger and probably slower-moving vehicle. Given the size and speed of the truck, the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior will need to be adjusted. To maintain safety, the autonomous vehicle may have to keep a safe following distance or may consider changing lanes to overtake the truck. Extra caution will be necessary due to the truck's reduced speed and the longer stopping distance required. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that affects the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is part of the rear undercarriage of a trailer truck. It includes the axle and wheels that are crucial for the truck's mobility. In a driving scenario, the presence of this truck implies that the ego car must maintain a safe following distance, as trucks have a longer stopping distance and can obstruct the driver's view of the road ahead. Drivers should also be aware that trucks may make wide turns and be prepared to give them extra space when necessary.",

If overtaking is considered, it should be done with extreme caution and only when visibility and traffic conditions safely allow. Use the vehicle's sensors and cameras to continuously assess the truck's speed and intentions, as well as to scan for any other road users or objects that might enter the roadway environment. If the road permits and it is safe to do so, the ego car can evaluate whether to overtake the truck, ensuring there's ample space and visibility to perform the maneuver without risk. Monitor the truck's indicators for any sudden turns or stops."
