The presence of this car affects the speed and movement of the ego car, necessitating a reduction in speed and preparedness to stop if the vehicle ahead is stationary or moving erratically. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be ready to react to any movements of the car ahead, such as slowing down, stopping, or turning.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic cones on the left side of the road, near the curb. These indicate a potential road hazard or construction site. The ego car may need to steer slightly to the right to avoid the coned-off area while maintaining a safe distance from any hidden obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, there is debris or irregularities on the road surface directly ahead of the vehicle. This poses a hazard and may require the vehicle to navigate carefully around it to avoid potential damage to the vehicle."

Be prepared to stop or navigate around the vehicle if it is stationary. Steer slightly to the right to give clearance to the traffic cones on the left, while being mindful not to venture too far into the center of the road where the other vehicle is positioned. Maintain vigilance for any debris on the road and be ready to adjust the vehicle's path as needed to avoid it safely. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, avoid distractions, and be prepared for possible maneuvers like braking or turning. Adjust speed according to the visibility provided by the headlights and ensure that the vehicle's own lighting is properly used to guarantee clear sight of the road ahead. Stay vigilant for any changes in the road conditions or unexpected obstacles, and veer slightly right to avoid the traffic cones while ensuring not to enter the opposite lane."
