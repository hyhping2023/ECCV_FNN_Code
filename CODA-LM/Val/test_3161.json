        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several key elements affecting the movement and behavior of the ego car. At the center of the intersection, a large yellow construction vehicle is either turning left or crossing the path from the ego car's left to its right, causing potential hazards due to its size and the construction work it may be associated with. It may obstruct views and require cautious navigation.\n\nTo the right of the intersection, beyond the traffic lights, is a stationary bus that could start moving and merge into traffic at any moment, necessitating that the ego car be prepared for this possibility. Its large size and slower speed may affect how the ego car times its turns or merges.\n\nIn the opposite lanes, there are various cars, with some turning and others possibly stopped due to a red light. A particular vehicle to note is a white car approaching the intersection in the leftmost lane, which may cross the ego carâ€™s path or turn left, requiring vigilance concerning the right of way.\n\nSeveral pedestrians are using a crosswalk to cross in front of the ego vehicle from right to left. As they have the right of way, the ego car must yield and remain stopped to ensure their safe crossing. Along with the pedestrians, cyclists are also present at the intersection, to the right of the ego car. They are vulnerable road users who may start moving when the traffic signal changes, and they could impact the ego car's ability to merge or change lanes to the right.\n\nThe traffic light facing the ego car is red in all directions, making it obligatory for the ego car to stop and remain stationary until the light turns green.\n\nOn the right side of the intersection, barriers suggest construction or roadwork, possibly leading to lane closures. These include fences and barriers on the left side of the intersection around a construction site, directing traffic and potentially altering usual traffic patterns. The ego car will need to navigate carefully and may need to follow detours or exercise increased caution due to these factors."

In the driving scenario, the ego car must maintain a safe distance from the bus, observe its signaling, and be prepared for it to make stops at designated bus stops where passengers can board and alight.

Caution should be exercised when the light turns green to avoid moving into the path of the construction vehicle or other vehicles that may receive priority when the light for the ego car remains red. The ego car should monitor the large construction vehicle for when it completes the turn and watch the stationary bus on the right for any signs of it merging into traffic. Moreover, the ego car should be aware of the cyclists' presence at the intersection and be prepared for them to move. It is also advised to be cautious about the barriers indicating possible roadworks and adjust the driving path if necessary. The driver should maintain awareness of the large vehicle in the intersection, the bus, and the cyclists. The driver should also anticipate possible changes in traffic patterns or detours due to the nearby construction and be ready to navigate them once it is safe to proceed."
