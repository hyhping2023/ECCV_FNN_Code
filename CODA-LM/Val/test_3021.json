The presence of this vehicle and the workers indicates active roadwork, which could obstruct the lane and slow down traffic. Additionally, workers in high visibility clothing are present around the construction vehicle in the road area. Given their potential for unpredictable movement, the ego car must maintain a safe speed and distance to ensure these workers' safety.

The presence of this machine indicates ongoing road construction or maintenance activity. The machine is occupying part of the road, and its operational status may cause a temporary obstruction. Consequently, the ego car must reduce speed and possibly change lanes if necessary, to ensure a safe distance from the workers and equipment. Adherence to temporary traffic signs and signals around construction zones is imperative for the safety of both the workers and the vehicle's occupants.",
