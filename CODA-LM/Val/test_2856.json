The size and position of this truck directly influence the driving route and line of sight of the vehicle. Caution is necessary because the movement of the truck may be unpredictable, and there is a possibility of debris falling from it.\n\nIn the opposite lane, one can see a person riding a bicycle, traveling in the direction opposite to that of our car. When overtaking this cyclist, it is crucial to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for any sudden movements by the cyclist, ensuring full attention is given to the situation."

Monitor oncoming traffic lanes to ensure safe overtaking of cyclists. Continue to pay attention to road conditions and other road users who may affect driving behavior. Drive cautiously, and prepare to change lanes for a safe overtaking of the construction vehicle if there is no oncoming traffic. Otherwise, slow down and maintain a safe distance behind the dump truck until there is an opportunity to overtake safely. Always be ready to stop in response to unpredictable changes in the situation ahead.",

Consequently, the ego car should be prepared to slow down and maintain a safe distance, possibly needing to stop or navigate around the construction area while being mindful of construction workers and other machinery.",
