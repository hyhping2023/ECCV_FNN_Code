Seeing the bright headlights suggests that the vehicle is either traveling towards the driver's direction or is stationary in such a way that the lights are facing the ego car. The driver of the ego car must remain attentive to this vehicle's movements, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared to adjust the path of the ego car to avoid collision. The glare of the headlights can also reduce visibility, so the ego car's driver should be cautious and possibly use the car's sun visors or adjust the rearview mirror to minimize glare impact if necessary.",

Additionally, ensure all the vehicle's lights are operational to enhance visibility to other road users. Finally, the ego car should be ready to execute evasive maneuvers if unexpected obstacles are detected."
