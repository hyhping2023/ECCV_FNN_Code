It is yellow and has reflective markings, with the bucket part currently lowered and positioned above the truck. The vehicle is large, and its position indicates it is either moving slowly or is stationary, with a visible platform, flashing beacon, and chevron markings indicating it may be involved in road work.",

If the vehicle is stationary or moving slowly, it would likely create a temporary obstruction that the ego car needs to safely navigate around. This vehicle may slow down, stop, or make sudden movements related to its maintenance activities, affecting traffic flow and potentially causing delays."

This yellow vehicle with reflective markings has its bucket part lowered and situated above the truck.

This vehicle is typically used in road work, maintenance, or construction tasks and may perform activities such as lifting materials or providing a work platform for workers at height. The vehicle's position on the road means that the driver of the ego car should remain cautious and prepared to potentially stop or slow down, as construction work might be taking place ahead that could interfere with normal traffic flow. The ego car should observe any posted traffic signs, workers' instructions, or lane changes related to the construction activity.",

The ego vehicle should signal and carefully change lanes to the left when it is safe to do so, taking into account the white car ahead in the left lane. If the construction vehicle begins to move, the ego car should follow at a safe distance until an opportunity to overtake arises. Continuous observation is essential to respond to the behavior of the construction vehicle and other potential road users that may emerge. Maintain a safe following distance from the maintenance vehicle ahead and be prepared for potential changes in speed or lane closures. Observe any signals or signs from traffic personnel. If the maintenance vehicle activates its indicators or there are signs of road work ahead, reduce speed accordingly, and if safe to do so, consider changing lanes to the left to pass the vehicle while complying with traffic regulations."
