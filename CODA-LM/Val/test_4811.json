The vehicle is positioned in a way that partially obstructs the lane closest to the curb, creating a risk if the vehicle moves. Alongside this parked vehicle and the road, there are numerous pedestrians walking. Their close proximity to the driving lanes presents a cautionary scenario for the ego vehicle to be prepared for any sudden or unpredictable pedestrian movements onto the road.\n\nThere are also red and white striped traffic barriers present, signaling a construction zone or ongoing road work. This situation naturally leads to a reduction in the available lanes for vehicular traffic, necessitating careful driving and lane navigation by the ego vehicle. The traffic barriers also serve to restrict the overall width of the usable road, possibly forcing the ego vehicle to alter its lane position to maintain safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, there is a basket located close to the curb on the right side of the road, alongside a potential dustbin or similar object situated on the sidewalk. Both of these items are considered hazards, and their presence demands continued monitoring, for there is a risk of them being moved or entering the driving lane, which could compromise traffic safety."
