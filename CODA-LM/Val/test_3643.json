Several cars are moving in the left lane in the same direction as the ego vehicle, and the flow of traffic in this lane should be considered for potential lane changes or to anticipate other drivers' actions. A small vehicle or motorcyclist is also spotted between lanes near a bus stop, exhibiting lane-splitting behavior, which is a safety concern due to their potential unpredictability.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is seen on the far right, next to a parked bus, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The possibility of the cyclist entering the roadway or changing direction should be considered to prevent any collisions. Pedestrians are present inside a bus shelter on the right side of the road, but they are not affecting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle as they are not crossing the street.\n\nThe traffic light overhead is not showing its current state, but it is important as it will control when the ego vehicle should stop or proceed. Lastly, various stationary objects such as benches and a dustbin are on the sidewalk, which do not pose an immediate threat but should be passively monitored.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Additionally, monitor the movements of the small vehicle or motorcyclist for any unpredictable maneuvers into the car's lane and remain alert for any unexpected pedestrian activity around the bus shelter."
