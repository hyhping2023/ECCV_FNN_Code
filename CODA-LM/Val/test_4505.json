This truck is occupying both the right lane and a portion of the left lane, limiting the visibility for the ego vehicle and potentially requiring it to adjust its speed or change path due to the truck's possible sudden stops or slow maneuvers. Additionally, there are overhead directional signs indicating a lane designated for making a right turn as well as a lane for proceeding straight or turning left. These signs provide the ego car with necessary information on the upcoming road layout and alert to possible lane changes by other road users. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects described in the scene."

Due to its size, it is occupying a significant portion of its lane and the back part is close to the adjacent lane. For the ego car, this means maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for a potential slow down or stoppage of traffic flow caused by the construction vehicle's operations or movements.

Additionally, even though no pedestrians are visible, caution is advised near the pedestrian crossing area. Stay alert for vehicles changing lanes near the exits."
