This vehicle, currently at a standstill, covers both lanes with its body and attached dumping container, indicating that the path of the ego car is obstructed and it cannot proceed forward. This situation suggests that the road may be partially closed or that the vehicle is involved in work-related tasks.\n\nAdditionally, on the left side of the road, there is a visible concrete barrier or curb.

Such heavy machine brings potential hazards due to its size, slow movement, and blind spots. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or maneuver cautiously, taking into account that the construction vehicle may make unpredictable movements, such as turning or backing up.

If the construction vehicle is temporary immobile due to active work being done, the ego car should observe for any road workers or signs indicating how to proceed. It may also be necessary to look for an alternative route or wait for the construction vehicle to move. If it's safe and legally permissible, reversing to a previous intersection or turn might be prudent to find a different path."
