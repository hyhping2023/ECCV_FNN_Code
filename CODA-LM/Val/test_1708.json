Starting with vehicles, there is a white truck parked in the left lane with caution cones placed in front and behind, suggesting it may be stationary for loading or unloading. Additionally, a red flatbed truck is located centrally, partially in the middle lane and angled towards the left, hinting that it might merge into the left or continue forward, thereby requiring careful overtaking. On the right, a blue sedan in the same lane as the ego car moves forward, influencing potential lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nVulnerable road users are also present, with multiple pedestrians on the far right on the sidewalk, one close to a person on a moving bicycle, alerting the ego vehicle to remain vigilant in case they enter the road.\n\nA traffic sign prohibiting stopping or parking is visible on the right, forbidding the ego car from halting in the area following the blue sedan.\n\nTraffic cones are noted in front of and behind the white truck, identifying a no-go zone and emphasizing the need to merge away. Additionally, a line of orange cones precedes the white truck, indicating potential hazards or restricted zones that the ego car must navigate cautiously.\n\nLastly, a dustbin resides on the sidewalk near the cyclist, and while not directly on the road, it serves as a reminder for the autonomous system to monitor for any unforeseen pedestrian movement around such objects. Traffic lights are absent from the scene, indicating no control at intersections or pedestrian crossings in the current view. No other barriers or objects are mentioned in the image."
