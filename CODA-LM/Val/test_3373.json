Firstly, there is a white SUV on the left lane moving in the same direction as the ego car, positioned ahead of it. The presence of the SUV requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible changes in the SUV's speed or direction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a heavy equipment yellow truck partially obstructing the right lane ahead, with several other vehicles behind it, also moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the truck suggests there might be a construction zone or a slow-moving vehicle which could merge back into traffic or require vehicles to change lanes to overtake.\n\nFurthermore, multiple vehicles of various sizes are driving ahead in both lanes, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The density and flow of this traffic will impact the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a 'No Parking' sign placed before the heavy vehicle/construction equipment. This sign indicates that vehicles should not stop or park on the side of the road, ensuring the flow of traffic around the construction area.\n\nLastly, there are blue and white striped barriers dividing the pedestrian walkway from the road, running along the right side of the road. These barriers separate the road from the sidewalk, providing a clear boundary that the ego car should not cross and reducing the risk of pedestrians entering the road unexpectedly.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Be prepared to adjust speed and position as necessary to accommodate changes in traffic flow, while keeping an eye for any signals or directions from traffic controllers that might be present due to the construction equipment."
