There is a large truck ahead in the same lane, displaying red taillights, which suggests that it is either slowing down or stopped. This necessitates that the ego car prepares to slow down or stop to maintain a safe following distance. Further ahead in the same lane as the truck, another vehicle is visible with its headlights on, indicating it might be moving. The ego car should monitor this vehicle for any sudden stops or turns that could impact the traffic flow. Additionally, multiple vehicles are observed in the adjacent lane to the right, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Their proximity and movement could influence the ego car's ability to change lanes if necessary.\n\nA traffic light, appearing to be in a green phase, is present but not clearly visible due to overexposure in the image. If confirmed green, the ego car can proceed but must remain cautious due to the unclear image quality.\n\nTo the right edge of the road, a barrier or barricade is visible, possibly marking construction or an off-limits area, thus affecting lane availability.\n\nLastly, an object that resembles a barrier or an open dustbin is spotted on the roadside near the lane but not obstructing the ego carâ€™s path. The ego car should be aware of this object and monitor for any unexpected movement or obstruction, though no immediate action is required."

The ego car should also stay in the lane, away from the barriers on the right side."
