                "description": "Several vehicles, including cars and motorcycles, are ahead in the same and adjacent lanes. Their front and rear lights are on at night, and they are either stopped or moving slowly. The illuminated brake lights indicate possible traffic congestion or a traffic jam. Several vehicles are clearly visible, with vehicles in both the left and right lanes, and a white car is directly stopped in the same lane ahead of this car.",
                "explanation": "An increase in vehicle density necessitates cautious speed adjustment and an increase in following distance to appropriately respond to traffic changes. The concentration of vehicles and their potential stopping or slowing down may require the vehicle to decelerate and prepare to stop. Queues of vehicles can lead to frequent stopping and starting situations, and the behavior of the white vehicle will directly affect the need to adjust our speed and maintain a safe following distance."

                "explanation": "Motorcycles are compact and agile, which allows them to change positions quickly. For this reason, it is imperative for the following vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and to remain vigilant for any sudden movements by the motorcycle. Given that motorcyclists may maneuver in less predictable ways and are not as conspicuous as other vehicles, it is necessary for the trailing vehicle to keep a proper safety margin and constantly be aware of any changes in the motorcyclist's position."

Their front and rear lights are illuminated, indicating possible traffic congestion or a traffic jam. A white car is stopped directly ahead in the same lane. The increase in vehicle density necessitates a cautious speed adjustment and an increase in following distance to effectively respond to traffic changes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist positioned between the lanes of traffic flow, traveling in the same direction as the other vehicles. Cyclists may ride unpredictably, posing a risk that requires the vehicle to be ready to slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance.\n\nMoreover, a motorcycle is weaving between lanes in the same lane ahead, while in the right lane, one motorcyclist is moving closer to our vehicle, and another has stopped farther away. Motorcycles' agility and quick position changes necessitate maintaining a safe following distance and constant vigilance for any sudden movements."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to traffic congestion, potential wet road conditions, as well as the presence of vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists and cyclists, this vehicle should maintain a cautious speed and increase the following distance from motorcycles, the white car, and other vehicles ahead. Pay attention to brake lights in order to detect stopping or slowing traffic ahead. Remain vigilant for changes in the position of motorcycles and possible lane changes or merges by other vehicles. Continue to monitor traffic light changes to respond to adjustments that may affect the flow of traffic, while also being prepared for increased stopping distances that may result from slippery road conditions. Moreover, be ready to react for the safety of all road users.",

Due to its presence, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to any changes in the vehicle's speed or direction. The ego car should also observe the vehicle's brake lights and indicators, which will provide information about the vehicle's intentions, such as turning or slowing down, influencing the ego car's driving behavior accordingly.",
