This vehicle might move slowly or stop suddenly, which can disrupt traffic flow and necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance.\n\nTo the left side above the road, there are two traffic signs: a no-honking sign followed by a speed limit sign indicating 40 km/h. These signs inform crucial traffic regulations, indicating honking is prohibited and the maximum speed allowed is 40 km/h, which the ego car must adhere to for safety and compliance.\n\nA green traffic light is visible to the left, signaling that traffic is allowed to proceed. Despite the green light, the ego car should advance with caution due to the presence of the heavy vehicle ahead.\n\nYellow and black temporary road barriers are observed on the left side of the road. These barriers indicate potential road work or lane merging ahead, requiring the ego car to navigate cautiously as traffic may need to merge or avoid certain sections of the road, affecting the available pathways."

Adhere to the posted speed limit of 40 km/h and avoid honking as indicated by the sign. Be prepared for potential lane closures or merges as indicated by the yellow and black barriers. Observe the green traffic light and proceed with caution due to the industrial vehicle ahead and potential for adjacent lane changes from other vehicles. Maintain a safe following distance behind the construction vehicle given its potential for unpredictable movements. Comply with the 40 km/h speed limit, prepare for slow-moving or stopped traffic due to the construction, and remain alert for any construction workers or equipment that may enter the roadway. Continue to observe the traffic lights and proceed with caution, taking note of any changes or new instructions presented by traffic control personnel or signs. If possible and safe, consider a lane change to the left in anticipation of any obstructions or delays caused by the construction vehicle."
