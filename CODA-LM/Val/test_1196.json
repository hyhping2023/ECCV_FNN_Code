Specifically, there are large industrial cable spools stacked by the side of the road, accompanied by a dustbin, both located on the right side of the image. The presence of these objects, although stationary and not on the roadway, suggests potential industrial activity in the vicinity. This activity could potentially impact traffic flow or create temporary obstructions due to operations related to loading or unloading."

This spool is stationary and located off the roadway, therefore it should not directly influence the future driving behavior of the ego car.
