        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are several elements to note which impact the behavior of the autonomous vehicle. A large green concrete mixer is positioned directly in front of the self-driving car, taking up the majority of the lane, hence the autonomous vehicle needs to decide how to maneuver around it safely. Nearby, a yellow taxi is situated to the front left but is obscured by an obstacle, suggesting possible traffic in the next lane that must be considered when planning to overtake the mixer truck. Furthermore, on the opposite lane ahead, a white car is seen near another green concrete mixer, illustrating slow-moving traffic and emphasizing the need for reduced speed and heightened vigilance.\n\nThere is also a worker wearing high-visibility clothing standing on the sidewalk to the right, outside the barrier. The worker's presence suggests possible roadside work, advising cautious and prudent driving. A cautionary traffic sign, which is partially hidden by tree branches, is placed on the same side. This sign likely forewarns of road construction or nearby hazards, signaling that drivers should remain alert and possibly slow down.\n\nAdditionally, both blue and white crash barriers are set up along the median and the right side of the roadway, defining road boundaries. These barriers restrict lane-changing options or pulling over, necessitating careful driving with respect to the limited road space. Moreover, the barriers on both sides of the road create a restricted passage on the left, highlighting the need for the vehicle to take into account the narrowed lane and the isolated construction zone on the right.\n\nTraffic lights and traffic cones are not present in this particular traffic scenario, nor are there other objects that impact traffic conditions. Thus, the autonomous vehicle's immediate decisions revolve around safely navigating around the large vehicles, considering the presence of nearby traffic participants, and adhering to the road restrictions indicated by signs and barriers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should slow down and maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer, cautiously observing when confirming that adjacent lanes are clear of traffic, and looking for opportunities to change lanes safely. Meanwhile, the driver needs to be vigilant for potential road activities indicated by road signs and the presence of workers, which may affect traffic flow or road conditions. Keep a safe distance from construction vehicles ahead, be ready to slow down at any moment, and carefully observe road workers and construction signs. Monitor the positions of taxis and other vehicles to prevent lateral movement. Since overtaking construction vehicles in this situation may pose risks, our vehicle should proceed with caution until a safe opportunity to change lanes or overtake is found.",

            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, is identified taking up a significant portion of the road, indicating that it may affect traffic movements. Given its size and the nature of its operations, the vehicle could frequently stop or move at a lower speed than the rest of the traffic, so the ego car would need to exercise caution and be prepared to slow down or switch lanes to avoid close proximity interactions.",
