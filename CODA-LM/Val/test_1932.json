This suggests a clear and unobstructed scene without any immediate elements affecting driving behavior or requiring navigational adjustments from an autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility in the image, it is recommended that the vehicle reduce speed and increase the following distance, allowing for longer reaction time. Additionally, the vehicle should turn on its headlights and fog lights (if equipped) to enhance visibility and ensure it is seen by other road users. Close attention should be paid to any potential hazards or road users, as these may become more apparent as the vehicle approaches. If the blur is due to technical issues with the camera or sensors, an immediate check and correction is necessary to ensure the safe operation of the autonomous driving system. If caused by external factors such as fog or heavy rain, the vehicle should use appropriate sensors (such as radar or LiDAR) for safe navigation, and consider pulling over if visibility does not improve and it is safe to do so.",

The presence of this car influences the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating a safe following distance. If the car slows down or stops, the ego car must be prepared to do the same to maintain safety on the road. The ego car may also need to consider changing lanes or adjusting speed to overtake the car if necessary and safe to do so according to the road conditions and traffic regulations.",
