A white car is driving in the middle lane to the left of the ego vehicle, which influences the ego car's following distance and speed adjustment. A dark-colored car is in the rightmost lane, overtaking the ego vehicle, affecting the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes or merge. Additionally, a bus is on the far left, ahead in the distance, indicating potential upcoming bus-related traffic activity such as stopping at a bus station that could influence traffic flow.\n\nRed and white traffic cones line up in the right lane, starting from the foreground and extending into the distance. These cones indicate a lane closure or obstruction, requiring the ego car to merge left if needed.\n\nTwo barriers are noted: Concrete barriers to the left of the ego vehicle separate the opposite traffic lanes, providing a physical separation from oncoming traffic and affecting lane change decisions to the left. Additionally, a continuous green barrier runs alongside the left edge of the highway, restricting vehicle movement to the left and influencing the ego vehicle's lateral clearance on that side."

It should signal early and check for the white car in the middle lane to ensure a safe lane change. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead to allow for reaction time to any sudden stops or changes in the flow of traffic."
