This vehicle is stationary and does not pose any immediate dynamic threat, but its presence along the side of the road reduces the available road width for maneuvering.\n\nThere are also several traffic signs present. A barrier arm is in a lifted position to the left side of the scene, indicating a controlled access point such as a parking lot or restricted area, but it is currently allowing vehicles to pass. Additionally, there is a barrier sign attached to a red and white striped pole located to the left of the ego car, which indicates a passage restriction, suggesting that the ego car should not attempt to navigate in that direction.\n\nA series of small yellow cones is placed along the right side of the lane, demarcating an area which seems restricted for use, possibly due to the presence of a repair shop and maintenance work. These cones signal that the ego car should not cross into the restricted area and should stay within the drivable lane.\n\nYellow bollards and a larger yellow barrier positioned to the side of the road, along with the vehicle ahead, likely indicate a pedestrian or work zone. These barriers necessitate that the ego car should avoid the designated area, potentially reducing speed or changing lanes if possible.\n\nLastly, there is debris present on the pavement to the right, just beyond the yellow barrier. This debris poses a hazard, and the ego car should maneuver cautiously around it if it is safe to do so."

Also, be mindful of the bollards to avoid drifting too close to the edge of the roadway. Since the barrier arm is up, it is safe to proceed without expecting cross-traffic from that area, but maintain awareness in case the access point is being used by other road users. The ego car should maintain its lane, stay clear of the restricted area marked by cones and the barrier, and reduce speed if necessary to safely navigate past the debris on the road. Maintain a cautious speed and prepare to stop or yield to the parked vehicle ahead if it enters the traffic flow. Observe the barrier signs and stay clear of the restricted area to the left. Be prepared to navigate around any potential roadwork or pedestrian area indicated by the bollards. Watch for and avoid debris on the road."
