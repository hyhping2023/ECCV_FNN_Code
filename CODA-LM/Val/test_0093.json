There is a black sedan directly ahead, in the same lane as the ego car, which could be stationary or moving slowly, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Also present is a red minivan to the left, which is partially obstructing the adjacent lane and could be either parked or moving slowly, affecting the ego car's lane-changing abilities. Additionally, a truck is seen in the distance on the right side of the road, moving away from the ego car, and its presence is important for maintaining traffic awareness.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are motorcyclists on the left side of the intersection who appear to be stationary. Their proximity at the intersection means the ego car must be cautious when moving through or turning.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are directional and informational signs overhead and to the right, which provide the ego car with information about permissible lanes and the upcoming road layout.\n\nA red traffic light is visible directly ahead, signaling that vehicles must stop, thereby requiring the ego car to come to a complete stop and wait for the signal to turn green.\n\nThere are also traffic cones positioned on the right, indicating a lane closure or construction ahead. These cones guide the ego car to stay within the safe driving boundaries and alert it to any possible construction activity or road workers.\n\nMetal barriers and a yellow gate define the left boundary of the roadway, marking an off-limits area and ensuring the ego car does not go beyond the designated road space.\n\nFinally, road workers are visible on the right side, which could potentially influence traffic flow and necessitate cautious driving with the readiness to stop or follow any given instructions."
