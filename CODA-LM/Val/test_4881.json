This positioning narrows the usable lane, requiring the ego car to steer slightly to the left to avoid a collision.\n- A white truck is ahead on the same road, also parked to the right side. The truck could start moving or loading/unloading, potentially causing unexpected obstruction, so the ego car needs to be cautious and ready to adapt its speed or direction accordingly.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users:\n\n- A pedestrian is moving on the sidewalk to the right of the road, ahead of the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the road and their potential to enter the road accentuate the need for vigilance from the ego car.\n\nFor traffic signs:\n\n- A yellow no parking sign is visible to the right of the road, mounted on a post. This sign indicates that parking is not allowed in this area, implying that the parked vehicles are in a no parking zone and might have to move unexpectedly, which needs to be monitored by the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is one traffic cone:\n\n- A traffic cone in front of the parked car could indicate a temporary hazard or road work. The ego car should be cautious and prepared for potential changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles.\n\nFinally, an object identified as other:\n\n- A cat lying in the middle of the road, ahead of the ego vehicle. This poses a risk and requires the ego vehicle to slow down or stop to avoid a potential collision."

Be prepared to steer slightly to the left to avoid the white hatchback, while ensuring a safe distance is kept from any potential oncoming traffic. Regularly check for any movements from the parked vehicles and be ready to stop if the pedestrian steps onto the road. Since there is a no parking sign, it's also important to stay attentive to the possibility that the parked cars or trucks may start to move, either pulling out or being approached by traffic enforcement. The ego vehicle should also be prepared to stop for the animal lying on the road and navigate around the traffic cone while watching for any other road users or oncoming vehicles."
