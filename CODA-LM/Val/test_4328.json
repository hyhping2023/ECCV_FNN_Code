The first is a cement mixer truck traveling in the same direction as the ego car, located in the left lane ahead. It is easily identifiable by its rotating drum and construction markings. The presence of this truck is significant because its large size could obscure the ego car's visibility and the truck's potential to make abrupt stops or lose debris from its drum necessitates maintaining an increased following distance.\n\nFurther down the road in the right lane, there is a yellow bus also moving in the same direction as the ego car. The bus's behavior is important to consider as it may make frequent stops, which could lead to sudden stopping or decelerating traffic ahead, affecting the flow of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are directional road signs overhead, which provide guidance on lane directions for various routes. These signs are crucial for drivers to ensure they are in the correct lane for their intended destination.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
