The low visibility increases the risk as the trucks may not be easily seen, and there is a possibility that they could move into the roadway or open doors, affecting the space available for the ego car to navigate.\n\nThe image quality is not clear enough to confirm the presence of any vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists. Due to the nighttime setting and low visibility, the ego car should drive cautiously in case there are vulnerable road users that are not visible in the image.\n\nA signpost is visible on the right side of the image; however, the content of the sign is indiscernible because of the low resolution and poor lighting conditions. This lack of information could be critical for the ego car as it might contain important navigation or traffic law details.\n\nAdditionally, there are piles of debris or construction materials on the side of the road. These could reduce the width of the drivable roadway and there might be debris on the driving path. The ego car should reduce speed and maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nThe JSON data does not list any traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects in the image, indicating that these elements are not present or not relevant in this scenario."

It should also prepare to navigate around potential road debris or potholes that are ahead. Moreover, maintain a safe distance from the parked trucks on the right to avoid any sudden movement from them or from any unseen pedestrians that may emerge between the vehicles. Due to low visibility and the presence of vehicles on the side of the road, the ego car should increase its following distance to allow for more reaction time. The car's headlights and any available night-vision assist systems should be utilized to improve visibility. The ego car should also be ready to stop or maneuver carefully if any of these parked vehicles show signs of movement or if the obscured traffic sign indicates a pertinent instruction or warning. It should continuously scan for any unexpected obstacles or vulnerable road users. Proceed with caution, reduce speed due to low visibility and the presence of parked vehicles, and obstacles on the side of the road. Be prepared to stop if any pedestrians or oncoming traffic not visible in the current frame emerge. Regularly monitor the parked vehicles on the roadside for any signs of movement or door opening which may suggest an occupant is about to exit the vehicle and enter the roadway."
