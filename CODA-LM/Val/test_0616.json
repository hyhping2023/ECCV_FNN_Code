The green left turn signal allows vehicles to turn left if in the correct lane, which is currently blocked by the construction vehicle. The ego vehicle must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large construction vehicle with an extended crane arm occupying the left lane and part of the middle lane, slighting encroaching into the ego vehicle's lane. This vehicle is a potential hazard as it disrupts the normal flow of traffic and may prompt other drivers to make sudden stops or change lanes. The ego car in particular needs to be cautious of the construction vehicle's position and the possibility of unexpected movements, which could necessitate adjustments in the lane position to maintain safety.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car is a silver sedan with its brake lights on, signaling that it is slowing down or preparing to stop, possibly in response to the traffic signal or due to the presence of the construction vehicle. This requires the ego vehicle to also slow down and maintain a safe following distance, being ready to come to a stop if required.\n\nThe traffic lights in view show a red signal for traffic intending to proceed straight ahead, and a green signal for making a left turn and for the oncoming traffic and pedestrian crossing. This red light mandates that all vehicles in the straight-going lanes, including the ego vehicle, come to a complete halt. However, even though a left turn is permissible according to the green left turn signal, the left turn lane is obstructed by the construction vehicle, necessitating vehicles to wait until the way is clear or the traffic light for straight-going traffic turns green.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier is seen on the right side of the road, restricting access to the sidewalk and accompanied by some young trees that have been stabilized. These objects highlight the fact that the ego car does not have the option to pull over to the right side of the street, further limiting maneuvering options."

            "description and explanation": "This is a heavy construction vehicle, specifically a boom-equipped machine, typically used for heavy lifting, digging, or excavation. It has an extended arm, which is indicative of its function for tasks like construction or maintenance. The presence of this vehicle in a driving scenario suggests caution for the ego car. This type of vehicle moves slowly and may make unpredictable movements or stops. It is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential obstructions or debris that might be present around the construction site. Ensuring adequate space and being ready to stop or maneuver safely around the construction vehicle will be crucial for the ego car's future driving behavior.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should come to a complete stop behind the vehicle in front due to the red traffic light, while keeping a safe distance from the construction truck on the left to avoid any potential hazards if the truck makes unexpected movements. Additionally, the ego car should stay alert for any unexpected movements from the construction vehicle or other road users that may react to the traffic disruption. The ego car should remain in the middle lane behind the silver sedan while maintaining a safe following distance. Since the construction vehicle is partially blocking the middle lane and fully blocking the left turn lane, and the traffic light is red for going straight, the ego car should prepare to stop until the traffic light changes to green and the road is clear to proceed."
