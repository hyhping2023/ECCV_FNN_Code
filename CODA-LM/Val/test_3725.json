The bus is an important road user to consider as it may stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers, which can cause abrupt stops or slow-downs in the traffic flow."

The presence of the red car indicates the traffic is potentially dense and changing lanes might be complex, requiring careful observation of the surroundings."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a couple of notable elements that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, directly ahead in the same lane is a large yellow bus. Its lights are not clearly visible due to glare, which suggests it might be stopped or moving slowly. The ego vehicle must be cautious, as the bus could potentially stop to pick up or drop off passengers, leading to unexpected interruptions in traffic flow.\n\nAdjacent to the ego car, in the right lane, is a red car that has its brake lights on. This suggests that the vehicle is coming to a halt or has already stopped. The behavior of the red car signals potential traffic conditions or control measures that the ego car might also encounter shortly. Traffic might be dense in this area, and changing lanes could require more attention.\n\nAhead in the scene, there are multiple red traffic lights. These indicate that vehicular traffic, including the ego car, is required to stop. Therefore, the ego car should comply with this signal and wait until the traffic lights turn green to proceed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that would affect the ego carâ€™s driving behavior. The primary focus should be on the immediate vehicles ahead and compliance with the visible traffic lights."

Monitor the red car's behavior for changes in the traffic flow but do not proceed until the traffic lights turn green. In the meantime, be attentive for any changes in the situation such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicles that may enter the scene. The ego car should remain at a complete stop, maintaining a safe distance from the large yellow vehicle ahead. The driver should be vigilant for the change of the traffic light to green and should be prepared to proceed with caution, especially considering the wet road conditions. Lane changes should be executed with awareness of the red car in the adjacent lane. No sudden movements or attempts to pass should be made while the lights are red. Due to the reduced visibility and wet road conditions, the speed should be adjusted to ensure safety. Until the red light turns green, the ego car should remain stationary and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from the bus ahead. Lane changes should be made with caution considering the proximity of the red car on the right."
