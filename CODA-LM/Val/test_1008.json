This large vehicle may obstruct the line of sight and requires maintaining a safe distance. In the opposite lane, there is a silver sedan facing our car, indicating oncoming traffic that affects maneuverability. Beyond the central divider, on the far right, there is a bus parked facing the opposite direction. This bus may start moving at any time, requiring this vehicle to adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain a safe passing distance. Additionally, a yellow excavator is located on the right side of the road, facing our vehicle. It could indicate nearby construction activities, potentially affecting road conditions or traffic flow.\n\nA pedestrian is crossing the road ahead from left to right. As pedestrians have the right of way, the autonomous vehicle must yield safely."

Maintain a safe distance from the blue dump truck and be ready to respond to any sudden lane changes or braking from the white sedan; watch for pedestrians who may enter the road from the left. Drivers should also be vigilant for potential construction activities from vehicles on the right. Given that the road is dry and the markings are clear, please drive carefully and be mindful of any debris from construction or hanging branches that may be present on the roadway.",
