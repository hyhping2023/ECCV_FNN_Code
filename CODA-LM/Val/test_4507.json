Be prepared for potential debris from the mixer. Watch for other vehicles that might enter the lane from the intersection ahead. Be attentive to the red truck in the adjacent lane as well as the red bus for any lane changes or stops. Do not attempt to overtake until it is clear and safe to do so. Approach the upcoming intersection with caution, anticipating the presence of other road users. Additionally, due to the dust kicked up, increasing the following distance may improve visibility and safety."
