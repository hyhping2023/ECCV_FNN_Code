A yellow construction vehicle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, within the same lane, which could be either moving slowly or potentially stationary, presenting an obstruction in the path that requires attention. Meanwhile, there are multiple cars to the left, in adjacent lanes, that are currently in motion. The presence of these vehicles is essential to consider as they are a part of the ongoing traffic flow and may affect the ability of the ego car to safely change lanes if needed.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians can be seen, but they are not impacting the immediate flow of traffic as they are not on the roadway. Additionally, a person wearing a high-visibility vest is standing near parked bicycles on the same sidewalk. Although they are easily noticeable, they are currently not a factor in the traffic flow since they are off the road.\n\nThe traffic infrastructure includes a green traffic light, which is visible ahead and signifies that the ego car has the right of way in its direction of travel.\n\nOther elements within the scene include tulips and other foliage in the center median to the right. Such features do not have any immediate impact on traffic but serve to enhance the visibility for drivers and add aesthetic value to the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that could influence the driving behavior of the ego car."

It should monitor the vehicle's signals or any crew instructions for guidance on when it may be safe to pass or change lanes. Changing lanes to the left may be an option, but only after ensuring it is safe to do so, taking into account the flow of traffic in those lanes. The driver should also remain alert to the possibility of the pedestrians entering the roadway unexpectedly or the construction impacting adjacent lanes. Following the traffic light, the ego car has the right of way to proceed but should do so with caution due to the presence of construction and other road users."
