Considering the congestion, it should not attempt to change lanes unless it's necessary and safe to do so. The driver should focus on vehicles' brake lights for cues on the flow of traffic and potential sudden stops. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, stay alert for any erratic movements from nearby vehicles, especially the white vehicle that appears to be changing lanes or adjusting within its lane. Monitor the truck on the left to prevent blind spot misjudgment. Prepare for potential stop-and-go scenarios and avoid sudden lane changes without clear visibility. Continue to scan the environment for any emergent signs, signals, or changes in traffic flow."
