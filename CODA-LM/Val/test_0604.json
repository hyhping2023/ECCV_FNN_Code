Specifically, there is a pedestrian wearing dark clothing who is walking along the side of the road approximately in the middle of the image; the pedestrian is facing away from the perspective of the ego car. The presence and behavior of the pedestrian may affect the driving strategy of the autonomous vehicle, since there is a potential risk should the pedestrian decide to enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nIn addition to the pedestrian, the scene includes large cable reels positioned on the side of the road and an item that appears to be a black dustbin. Although these objects are not on the driving path, the autonomous vehicle must approach the area with caution to account for any unforeseen developments, such as a sudden obstacle appearing on the road.\n\nThere are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in this image."
