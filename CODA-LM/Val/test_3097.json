The second vehicle is a red car on the left, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle, in the left lane.

Although it doesn't directly guide immediate driving behavior, it provides context for navigation and situational awareness.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image."
