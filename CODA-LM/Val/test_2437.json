The proximity and path of this van are significant as they inform the decision-making for keeping a safe distance behind it and for any considerations regarding changing lanes. Additionally, there is a sequence of obstacles situated to the right of our vehicle, delineating the edge of the road and signaling that vehicles are not permitted to cross into that area. These barriers are essential as they direct autonomous vehicles to remain on the correct, navigable portions of the roadway. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or miscellaneous objects to report in the current traffic image."

Due to low light conditions that may reduce the visibility of unexpected obstacles, cautious driving is advised. Be aware of obstacles on the right side, and our vehicle should not attempt to overtake them. There are no visible traffic signs or lights in the image that require immediate action, so our vehicle should continue to exercise general caution suitable for nighttime conditions.",
