Firstly, there is a blue car in the distance, driving towards the autonomous vehicle on the opposite side of the road. The presence of this car requires the autonomous vehicle to stay alert and maintain a safe distance in case it continues to move forward or turns.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white car ahead, facing away from the autonomous vehicle and located in the center of the lane. The actions of this white car will influence the autonomous vehicle's speed and lane choice, as it is directly in its path.\n\nOn the left side of the autonomous vehicle, a cyclist is moving in the same direction. The autonomous vehicle should ensure a safe overtaking distance or be prepared to slow down if the cyclist's behavior suggests they might enter the road or make a turn.\n\nPedestrians are also present in the scene. One is moving parallel to the autonomous vehicle's direction on the sidewalk to the right, and another is passing by trees on the same sidewalk. Although they are not on the road, the autonomous vehicle must remain vigilant in case they step onto the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAn obstacle with yellow and black stripes, resembling traffic cones, is located on the left side of the road. This barrier indicates a no-entry zone, and the autonomous vehicle must keep to the right, avoiding the closed lanes or areas.\n\nLastly, there is a trash can with a pile of garbage bags beside it on the sidewalk to the right of the autonomous vehicle. While this is a stationary object that should not directly affect driving behavior, the autonomous vehicle should be aware of potential sudden changes, such as debris entering the road.\n\nThe traffic scene does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones that need to be considered in this summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, be prepared to adjust your speed based on their movements, and change lanes when necessary to safely pass cyclists while taking into account the reduced lane width due to barriers. Be alert for roadside trash bins and keep a sufficient safety margin to avoid accidental risks. Stay in your lane and be aware of the position of cyclists, ready to adjust your speed or position in response to their possible actions. Monitor the movement of pedestrians, being ready to react to them unexpectedly stepping onto the road. Drive carefully in areas with barriers, stay vigilant, and be ready to pay attention to any roadwork or obstacles. Proceed cautiously, keeping a safe following distance from the white car ahead. Be aware of any unexpected lane changes from the blue car on your left. Be prepared to give cyclists ample space and pay attention to any changes in their movements. Watch out for pedestrians on your right to prevent them from entering your driving lane. Slow down when approaching areas with traffic cones and obstacles, and be ready to safely navigate around any barriers. Monitor for any debris from the area around the trash bins on the right that may affect your driving path.",
