It appears to be parked, facing the ego vehicle, with its rear lights illuminated. The presence of this vehicle may narrow the drivable roadway, could obscure pedestrians or other hazards, and suggests that there could be a roadside situation. Drivers are advised to proceed with caution as there may be people moving around the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, distant traffic lights are visible with at least one green light showing. The green light indicates that the ego car has the right of way in the observed direction. However, caution is advised due to the poor lighting conditions, which may affect visibility.\n\nThere are possible barriers or objects on the right side near the stationary vehicle, but they are not clearly visible. These could potentially narrow the driving path or indicate ongoing road work. Drivers should exercise caution when passing by.\n\nLastly, there are multiple points of light in the scene that could be reflecting off objects or be street lights. However, these lights do not provide significant illumination. As a result, the ego car should rely more on its own light sources and sensors to navigate safely, as the lights do not offer enough information about the road ahead."

The car should also be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully around the parked vehicle and any unseen hazards. Use of advanced sensors like LIDAR or infrared for obstacle detection is recommended. Additionally, the ego car should monitor for any signs of movement around the parked vehicle and be ready to react if it becomes a dynamic obstacle."
