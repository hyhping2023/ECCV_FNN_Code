Since the traffic light state is unknown, the ego car should observe the actions of other vehicles for cues and proceed with caution, especially if approaching an intersection. Additionally, the presence of the construction vehicle warrants readiness to respond to any potential changes in traffic due to construction work, such as lane closures or temporary traffic signals. Regular scanning of the road for any new obstacles or changes in traffic conditions is recommended."
