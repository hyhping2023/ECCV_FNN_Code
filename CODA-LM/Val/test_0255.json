There's a white vehicle with red and white markings and Chinese characters indicating a taxi (\"出租\") stopped diagonally on the right side of the road. It partially occupies the lane ahead and is likely an emergency or service vehicle, necessitating a cautious maneuver around it. Furthermore, there are several cars moving in the same direction as the ego car that set the pace for the speed and following distance.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, pedestrians are spotted on both sides of the crosswalk, with some waiting to cross and others walking along the sidewalk. Due to their proximity to the crosswalk, the ego car must be ready to yield and ensure their safety.\n\nThere are traffic signs present as well; a pedestrian crossing sign is placed on the right, before the crosswalk, signaling the priority for pedestrians and advising the ego car to be ready to stop. Additional directional signs provide lane guidance and parking rules, which help the ego car maintain proper lane usage and understand the upcoming road layout.\n\nFinally, a series of orange traffic cones line the edge of the lane, leading towards the stopped vehicle on the right, defining a boundary for the driving area and indicating a narrower lane. The presence of these cones suggests that there is road work, pedestrian safety measures, or some temporary traffic control in place, which means vehicles should slow down and exercise caution.\n\nNo barriers or other objects are reported in this scene."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a safety device used in road traffic control to mark the edges of a vehicular path under various conditions. Typically cone-shaped, bright orange, and with reflective strips, it provides high visibility. Here, the traffic cone denotes a boundary that vehicles should not cross, indicating a construction zone, an area of hazard, or a change in traffic patterns. In this scenario, the vehicle, referred to as the ego car, must steer clear of the cones and may need to merge or shift into another lane to avoid them, ensuring safe passage through the potentially altered traffic condition.",

It is used to redirect traffic or indicate areas where drivers should not drive, often due to road work or an obstacle on the road. In this case, it signifies that the driver should stay clear of the area marked by the cones and be prepared to possibly merge or change lanes to accommodate the restricted traffic flow pattern.",

Maneuver carefully around the stopped vehicle ahead, while also respecting the temporary boundary established by the traffic cones. Pay attention to the traffic signs indicating parking regulations and the presence of a crosswalk to anticipate any potential pedestrian movements. It is also advisable to scan for any pedestrians that may enter the crosswalk unexpectedly and to monitor any movements of the stopped vehicle."
