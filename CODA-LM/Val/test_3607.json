On the right side of the road, there is a white van facing the same direction as the ego car, but it is stationary. The presence of this van is important because it could potentially move onto the road, affecting the ego car's path. Further ahead on the left side, several construction vehicles, including a yellow excavator, are positioned and appear stationary. These vehicles are part of roadwork operations and could lead to obstructions or road closures.\n\nThere are multiple construction workers on the road; some are within the closed section on the left, and one is crossing the road from left to right in front of the ego car. The workers can influence the available space for maneuvering and necessitate cautious driving from the ego car.\n\nA yellow directional signboard in the distance indicates road work or a diversion to the left. This sign suggests that there may be a change in traffic patterns, such as lane merges or diversions, for which the ego car must be prepared.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the current field of view, which means the ego car should follow other traffic control devices and adhere to the rules of the road relevant to the construction zone.\n\nOrange traffic cones are set up in a pattern that partially closes off the lane directly in front of the ego car, guiding vehicles into the adjacent lane. The cones indicate a lane shift or detour, requiring the ego car to change lanes to the left to avoid the closed-off area.\n\nConcrete barriers are present on the left side of the road, creating a physical separation between the oncoming lanes and the worksite. These barriers control the flow of traffic, protect the worksite, and may impact traffic speed by narrowing the passable road.\n\nLastly, there are other objects such as a wheelbarrow near one of the road workers and stacks of paving stones to the side of the road. These indicate active roadwork and suggest that there may be unexpected movements near the workers, requiring the ego car to exercise extra caution."
