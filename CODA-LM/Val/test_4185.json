The driver should be ready to take evasive action if the pedestrians move into the roadway. It is also recommended to turn on the full beam of the headlights, if not already done, to increase visibility if there is no opposing traffic. The object on the right should be monitored in case it moves into the driving path or presents an obstruction. Continuous monitoring of the pedestrian's movements is crucial as the ego car passes by slowly and safely. Be prepared for sudden movements either from the individuals or potential objects entering the roadway. Maintain a safe distance from the roadside where the individuals are situated and pass with caution."
