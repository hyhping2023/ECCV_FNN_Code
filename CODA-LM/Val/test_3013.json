They can be identified by their reflections and their location near the curb. These parked vehicles reduce the available driving space, compelling the ego car to be vigilant and maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential collisions. \n\nAdditionally, considering the low-light conditions of the environment, there appears to be a figure that might be a pedestrian walking close to the aforementioned parked cars on the right side of the road. This situation heightens the collision risk, requiring the autonomous driving system to proceed with extra caution to ensure safety.\n\nAll other categories, including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, are not present in the image and thus do not need to be considered in this particular summary of the road conditions."

Use headlights to improve visibility and be prepared to stop if necessary. Since visibility is low, other road users such as pedestrians or cyclists could be more difficult to see. Proceed with caution, particularly due to the presence of a possible pedestrian on the right side of the road. Slow down due to the wet road conditions and allow for increased braking distance. Keep a watchful eye for any sudden movements from the pedestrian or other unexpected hazards that may emerge from the parked vehicles or the side of the road."
