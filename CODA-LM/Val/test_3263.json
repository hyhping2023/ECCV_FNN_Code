The vehicles present include a gray van parked on the left, which reduces the road width and poses a potential risk if it moves. There is a forklift in the ego vehicle's lane, facing it with lights on, posing as an immediate obstacle that must be navigated with care. Additionally, a white car is parked behind a red truck, not directly blocking the ego vehicle but contributing to the congestion and limiting maneuvering space.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights presented in the scene.\n\nHowever, there are red and white traffic cones aligned in front of the parked truck. These cones suggest a working area or temporary obstruction, requiring the ego vehicle to navigate around them. A barrier with red and white warning stripes is also present to the right of the road in front of the parked truck, indicating a restricted area and reducing the navigable space.\n\nLastly, there are large containers or cargo on the right side of the scene, creating a situation with limited space and visibility. These objects may conceal other road users or obstacles, demanding cautious driving behavior."

Given the narrow space and immediate obstacle presented by the forklift, the vehicle should come to a stop if necessary to assess the situation and wait for the forklift to clear the path. If safe passage is unclear or requires maneuvering close to obstacles, it should signal to alert any unseen road users and proceed with caution. Continuous monitoring of the environment is crucial, especially for any unexpected movements from the forklift or workers that may emerge."
