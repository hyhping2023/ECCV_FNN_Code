The autonomous system in the observing vehicle must ensure it maintains a safe following distance from the white car and be prepared to react to any sudden moves it might make.\n\nNext to the right of the observing vehicle, a yellow excavator is observed, parked on a red lowboy trailer. The excavator is occupying a portion of the right-hand lane. This suggests there could be construction or that the excavator is in the process of being loaded or unloaded. As a result, the autonomous vehicle might need to change lanes or reduce speed as a precautionary measure.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones are detected in the image.\n\nAround the excavator, there is a barrier that separates the sidewalk from the roadway, which implies there is a temporary obstruction along the right side of the road. Due to this barrier, the autonomous vehicle is advised to slow down and stay alert for potential changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles that could impede normal driving."

If it is safe to do so, make minor adjustments to your lane position to avoid the area marked with construction obstacles. Be prepared to deal with changes in road layout caused by construction, and pay attention to temporary traffic signs that may not be visible in the image. Keep a safe following distance from the white sedan in front, while also being ready to merge left if necessary due to construction. Slow down to handle potential changes in road surface quality and be prepared for sudden stops or changes in direction that may arise due to changing road conditions.",

In this driving scenario, the position of the construction vehicle suggests it could be involved in nearby construction work and may present a temporary obstruction. The ego vehicle should slow down, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared to stop or divert if necessary, following any directions from signs or site personnel.",

These panels are typically bright in color for high visibility. The presence of this barrier indicates that there may be a construction site or a temporary road closure ahead, potentially necessitating a detour or additional caution when approaching the area.
