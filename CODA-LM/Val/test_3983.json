However, there is a temporary traffic light mounted on a yellow and black striped stand in the center of the road, which is displaying a green signal. This indicates that the ego car is allowed to proceed, but the unusual placement of the traffic light suggests there may be road work or a temporary traffic reroute. Accompanying the traffic light, there are yellow and black striped traffic cones set up underneath it, partially obstructing the lane. These cones serve as a warning for a potential hazard or change in traffic patterns, necessitating that the ego car may need to slow down or change lanes. Additionally, the stand supporting the temporary traffic light acts as a barrier and is a clear indication of potential road work or redirection, requiring the driver to exercise caution and possibly prepare for an alteration in the usual traffic flow. There are no other objects or traffic signs in the image."

Additionally, given the road conditions, reduce speed to adapt to potentially slippery surfaces and maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles."
