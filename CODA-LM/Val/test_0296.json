It could obstruct the ego vehicle's path and must be watched closely for any unexpected stops or direction changes. Several other cars are observed in both adjacent and opposite lanes at various distances from the ego vehicle, potentially affecting lane changes or speed adjustments. In an opposite lane, a black sedan is stopped at a red light; it is not an immediate concern but signifies halted traffic in that direction. A white sedan is traveling parallel to the ego lane on the far right and might cross the ego vehicle's path if it decides to turn left. A blue tow truck is moving away from the intersection on the right and is not currently affecting driving decisions but should be noted in case its direction changes.\n\nTraffic Lights: There is a traffic light visible ahead of the ego car showing red, indicating the necessity for the ego vehicle to stop and wait until the signal turns green.\n\nTraffic Cones: A line of orange and white traffic cones is positioned at the intersection to define the boundary of the lanes. The ego vehicle is required to stay to the left of these cones to follow the correct traffic flow.\n\nBarriers: On the right side, yellow and black striped barriers mark the edge of the roadway. The ego car must keep a safe distance from these barriers to prevent any collisions.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects are present in the image."

The ego driver should monitor the surrounding traffic, especially the white cargo truck crossing the intersection, and wait for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding. Additionally, the driver should prepare for the potential left turn of the white sedan on the far right and keep the orange traffic cones to the left side. The ego vehicle should come to a complete stop due to the red traffic light, ensuring it does not block the crosswalk. It should monitor the cargo truck and other vehicles for unexpected maneuvers. No immediate lane changes or turns are recommended until it is legal and safe to pass through the intersection once the light turns green."
