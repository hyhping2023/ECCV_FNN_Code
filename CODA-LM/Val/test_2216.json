        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene includes a set of traffic cones, a barrier, and another object. Specifically, there are orange and white reflective traffic cones aligned on the right side of the lane which signal the likelihood of a work zone ahead or a narrowing of the road. These cones necessitate a careful and potentially slower approach from the self-driving vehicle, with the possibility of needing to merge into an adjacent lane if the current one is blocked.\n\nMoreover, an isolation booth with its gate raised is positioned on the right edge of the road, suggesting that there is no active traffic control. Even so, the self-driving vehicle must be ready to adapt, maintaining a safe distance in case the booth's barrier is deployed unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, there is a booth-like structure with reflective stripes also on the right, which could be a construction site office or a checkpoint hut. This object serves as an indication of roadside construction or activity, reinforcing the need for caution when passing through the area."

    "driving_suggestion": "As they approach the obstacle booth, self-driving cars should slow down and remain alert to pass safely without stopping. When the gate is raised, vehicles can proceed, but drivers should be ready to stop at any moment to respond to potential changes. Vehicles should also slightly adjust their position to the left within the lane, or, if the lane is blocked, signal in advance and merge into the adjacent lane when necessary to bypass the cone signs and booths while maintaining a safe distance from them and other road users. Maintain a safe speed suitable for wet road conditions and drive within the designated lane, staying away from the cone-blocked area on the right. Stay alert for any activities around roadside construction or potential checkpoints, and be prepared to respond to temporary road signs or directions from road workers that may not be visible in the picture. Continue to monitor parked vehicles for any signs of movement.",
