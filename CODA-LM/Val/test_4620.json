However, it does feature barriers, specifically large industrial spools placed by the roadside against the wall, with some having already collapsed. The significance of these barriers is that while they are off the road surface and should remain stationary, not affecting the driving behavior of the vehicle as long as they do not move. Additionally, there are other objects present: large cable drums and smaller coils of material stored behind a low wall on one side of the road, resting on the ground. Although these objects could be dangerous if they were to move onto the road, they are currently stationary and separated from the roadway by a barrier, suggesting no immediate risk to passing vehicles."

Reduce your speed to accommodate the increased braking distance, and pay attention to roadside objects to ensure they are secure and stationary.
