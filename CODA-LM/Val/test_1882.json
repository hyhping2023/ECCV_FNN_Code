The truck has visible signage and equipment for cement mixing. Its presence and size could obstruct the view of the ego vehicle, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance or preparation to change lanes.\n\nAn orange taxi is parked on the left side of the road, adjacent to the ego car's lane. While the taxi is stationary and does not pose an immediate hazard, vigilance is required in case it re-enters the lane or passengers embark/disembark.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, a pedestrian is visible, moving parallel to the road. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, they should be monitored in case they decide to cross the street or unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\nA No parking sign is visible on the sidewalk to the left, indicating the parking regulations along that part of the road. This sign is informative for parking behavior but does not impact the immediate driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nThere is a series of red and white traffic cones placed in an angled line extending from the sidewalk into the ego car's lane, directing traffic away from the side of the road. These cones signal a narrowing of the drivable road space, requiring vehicles to merge left or slow down.\n\nTemporary red barriers are positioned along the roadside to the right, contributing to the lane narrowing indicated by the traffic cones. These barriers serve as a physical deterrent, preventing vehicles from driving close to roadside works or obstacles.\n\nLastly, multiple dustbins are situated on the sidewalk to the right. While they do not pose a threat to the ego car's path unless they unexpectedly enter the roadway, the ego vehicle's driving system should monitor them."
