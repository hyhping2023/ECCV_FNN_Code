The sedan's deep color and illuminated headlights suggest that it is currently in use or has been used recently. The positioning of this vehicle is significant as it obstructs part of the driving lane and may reduce the visibility of the vehicle to others, presenting a potential hazard to the autonomous driving system. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

Attention must be paid to the high beams of oncoming vehicles, which signal the need to be aware of oncoming traffic and potential obstacles. Continuously assessing the dynamics of all observed vehicles is crucial for safe navigation and preparing to respond to their potential sudden stops or turns. Moreover, due to poor visibility, this vehicle should turn on its headlights to enhance visibility and ensure safe navigation.",
