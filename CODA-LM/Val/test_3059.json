On the left side of our vehicle, a yellow vehicle is traveling in the adjacent lane in the same direction. The presence of this vehicle is important as it may affect our ability to change lanes or maintain a safe distance due to its approach and parallel trajectory.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a group of workers wearing high-visibility clothing, some of whom are close to the roadway. The proximity of the workers to the traffic lane necessitates a reduction in speed and an increase in vigilance to ensure their safety.\n\nA blue directional sign with an arrow is situated on the left side of the road, indicating that there is a right turn ahead. While this sign does not command drivers to take immediate action, it is important for informing them of upcoming road options and preparing for the possibility that other drivers may slow down to make the turn.\n\nSeveral orange traffic cones are placed around the workers on the right side of the road, marking the work area. These cones signal a temporary change in traffic patterns and alert drivers to be cautious, potentially requiring a merge to the left if the right lane is blocked by the work zone.\n\nAdditionally, a series of blue barriers are located on the right side, creating a separation between the construction area and the traffic lanes. These barriers serve as a visual cue to drivers about potential road obstructions or work areas and are in place to protect the workers.\n\nLastly, there is a piece of stationary machinery next to the construction workers on the right side of the road. This machinery may limit the workers' movements and impact the route of our vehicle, highlighting the need for increased attention when navigating through the area.\n\nThe traffic lights category is empty, indicating that there are no traffic lights affecting the driving behavior in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of workers and traffic cones on the right side, please drive carefully. Maintain lane discipline and avoid sudden lane changes to ensure a safe distance from the yellow vehicles in the adjacent lane. Proceed slowly in the construction area, comply with any speed limit signs related to road work, and be prepared to merge lanes if the right lane is partially blocked by workers or equipment. Additionally, it is advisable to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead to provide ample stopping distance. When slowing down in the work zone, regularly checking the rearview mirror for vehicles approaching from behind is also a wise move. Exercise caution when passing vehicles with hazard lights on and stay alert for any potential movements of roadside workers or other road users adapting to the situation.",
