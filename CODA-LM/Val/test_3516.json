This suggests that there may be an obstacle or traffic situation ahead, and the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to slow down or stop.\n   - A gray sedan is partially visible on the left side, suggesting it is navigating the same road. This vehicle, although not an immediate obstacle, limits the usable width of the road and impacts maneuverability. The ego car should be vigilant of any potential sudden movements or lane changes by this sedan.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - The headlights of the ego car illuminate the legs of a person to the right, who is not fully visible and appears to be outside of a pedestrian crossing area. This pedestrian poses a potential hazard as they may enter the road, requiring the driver to be ready to stop or slow down.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A reflective 'No Parking' sign is visible on the right side of the image, indicating parking restrictions in the area. This sign may affect the decisions of the ego car, such as no parking or no entry zones.\n   - A round, red and white 'No Entry' sign is visible on the right side of the road above the white SUV. This sign indicates that entry is prohibited beyond this point, suggesting that the road may be closed ahead or reserved for other types of users.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Traffic cones with alternating yellow and red colors are lined up to create a barrier, directing the flow of traffic to the left. These cones indicate that the ego car must stay within the designated lane and suggest the presence of a work zone or road narrowing ahead.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n   - A barrier created by traffic cones is present, guiding the traffic flow.

No sudden lane changes should be made, as the parked gray sedan and the traffic cones limit the available road space. The ego car should also be attentive to any traffic sign instructions not visible in this image. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the white SUV. Be prepared to navigate around the traffic cones and barriers, following the redirected traffic flow to the left. Watch for any movement or signals from other road users, especially considering the poor visibility at nighttime. Be attentive for any unexpected actions by the pedestrian on the right. Obey all relevant traffic signs and adjust speed as necessary. The ego vehicle should not attempt to enter the area restricted by the 'no entry' sign."
