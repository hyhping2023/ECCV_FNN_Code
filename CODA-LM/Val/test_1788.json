The position of the sedan suggests that it may have the right of way depending on the traffic signal applicable to its direction. Additionally, there is a red traffic light visible on the right side of our vehicle, which is accompanied by a countdown timer showing \"31\". This indicates that vehicles traveling in the direction of the vertical lanes are required to stop and wait. Meanwhile, our vehicle has the right-of-way to proceed through the intersection or make a turn as per the planned route.

Be aware of any pedestrians who might step onto the crosswalk, even though the light is green for vehicles. Considering that the traffic light is green and there are currently no direct obstacles or road users requiring yielding, drivers should still be vigilant of the remaining time on the pedestrian countdown timer in case there is a need to prepare to stop when the light changes. Vehicles making a left turn should be monitored until they have completely cleared the intersection to ensure they do not create any conflicts.",

These devices are often brightly colored and reflective for high visibility. In the driving scenario, encountering a traffic cone may signify roadwork, an obstruction on the road, or a temporary change in the traffic pattern. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to alter its course around the cone to continue driving safely.",

Depending on its location on the road, it could signal a temporary change in traffic patterns or a potential obstacle that drivers should navigate around.
