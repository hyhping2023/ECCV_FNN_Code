        "description and explanation": "The scene captured in the traffic image presents a complex urban driving scenario that includes various road users and signals. Firstly, the image reveals two vehicles positioned on the left side of the road. A silver SUV is noted to be parked in a manner that partially obstructs the roadway. This situation calls for heightened awareness, as the presence of the SUV not only diminishes the available roadway for passage but also poses a risk should the vehicle suddenly move or if passengers attempt to exit the vehicle. Additionally, a white SUV is observed parked directly ahead of the silver SUV, with both vehicles narrowing the drivable section of the road. The close proximity of these vehicles necessitates a strategic adjustment of the driving path for safe maneuvering around the stationary vehicles.\n\nAmidst the vehicles, the traffic infrastructure includes a pivotal traffic sign, a circular blue sign showcasing a white arrow pointing left, affixed to a pillar ahead. This sign signals the allowance for leftward turns, underscoring the importance of decelerating and proceeding with caution while preparing to navigate the turn. Meanwhile, the absence of visible traffic lights and traffic cones in the image simplifies the immediate decision-making process but does not diminish the need for vigilance.\n\nObstructions and hazards are further delineated through barriers and miscellaneous objects identified in the vicinity of the left-turn sign. Barriers alongside what appears to be construction-related materials or debris occupy the space adjacent to the SUV and the sign, implying possible roadwork or a blockage. This obstacle serves as a directive for vehicles to steer clear of the area next to the SUV, adhering to the instruction provided by the left-turn sign. Additionally, the presence of large bags or sundry items collected at the base of the roadside marker suggests a temporary alteration in the road configuration, potentially due to construction or cleanup efforts. This environment signals autonomous vehicles to remain cautious, accounting for the possibility of further obstructions or a reduction in navigable road space.\n\nIn summary, the traffic image showcases a scenario that demands a multifaceted response. The combination of stationary vehicles, explicit direction through traffic signs, potential roadwork signaled by barriers and debris, as well as additional unspecified objects calls for a carefully modulated driving strategy. Ensuring safe passage through this section of the road involves not only adherence to visible signs but also a proactive approach to unanticipated hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to limited visibility and the narrowing of the road width by parked vehicles on the side, our vehicle should reduce its driving speed to ensure sufficient safety reaction time for any unexpected hazards. Moreover, our vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles to avoid being affected by car doors opening unexpectedly or vehicles pulling out without warning. The use of headlights and all available auxiliary lights should be employed to enhance visibility and alert other road users to the presence of our vehicle. Furthermore, be prepared for potential obstacles or irregular situations, such as the possibility of more parked vehicles ahead or debris on the road. Influenced by mandatory direction signs and potential obstacles or construction indicated, our vehicle should slow down and plan to make a left turn at the intersection. Avoid getting too close to parked vehicles to prevent them from suddenly joining the traffic flow.",
