        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and signs to take note of. Firstly, there is a large truck ahead in the same lane as our vehicle, traveling in the same direction. The size and position of the truck could limit visibility and require a longer braking distance. It is important for our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the truck's potential sudden stops or deceleration.\n\nAdditionally, a silver mini van is observed ahead in the left lane, also moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The presence of this van requires monitoring in case it changes lanes or slows down, especially since its brake lights are on, indicating that traffic could be slowing or stopping ahead.\n\nVisible through the gap between the silver van and the large truck is a silver car in the left lane, moving forward. If our vehicle intends to change lanes, the position of this car must be taken into account to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nThe only traffic sign visible in the image is a green overhead sign indicating the direction of the lane and an upcoming exit on the right. This sign is crucial as it provides information that could influence the decisions of surrounding drivers and assist in route planning.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck in front and the silver mini-van to prevent any issues if they suddenly brake or decelerate. Continually assess the surrounding traffic conditions, especially the mini-van and silver sedan, paying attention to any signs of changing lanes or slowing down, which could affect your driving route. Be ready to adjust your speed or change lanes if necessary, but ensure the adjacent lane is clear and safe before doing so. Meanwhile, keep an eye on any changes in speed or lanes from the flatbed truck, and pay attention to overhead traffic signs for navigation.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically designed for use in engineering contexts such as construction sites. It appears to be a heavy-duty truck with specialized equipment mounted on its back for tasks related to construction or maintenance work. Due to its size and the nature of its operations, the vehicle may move slower than typical traffic and might make frequent stops or have erratic movement patterns. Consequently, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for unexpected stops, and exercise caution when maneuvering around the construction vehicle, especially if overtaking, as it may occupy more of the lane or make sudden movements.",
