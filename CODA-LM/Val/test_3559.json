        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large yellow truck directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane. The truck is displaying rear warning lights and reflective markings. This truck is significant for the ego car as it must maintain a safe following distance and may need to prepare to overtake if the truck is moving slowly. Due to the truck's size and position, the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car is limited, which could require the ego car to reduce speed or change lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 'No stopping' ('clearway') sign on the left side of the road, positioned above a speed limit sign indicating '40'. The no stopping sign means that the ego car is not permitted to stop on the roadway, while the speed limit sign mandates that the ego car should not exceed 40 km/h. These signs direct the ego car to continue moving without stopping and to maintain a speed that does not surpass the specified limit.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Typically, this type of vehicle is involved in road works or construction projects. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates that there may be road work ahead. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow-moving traffic due to the construction vehicle's operations or possible lane restrictions associated with the construction work.

As with any vehicle on the road, maintaining a safe following distance is essential to provide sufficient time to react to the car's actions.

Additionally, ensure to obey the speed limit of 40 km/h as indicated by the traffic sign. Do not stop on the carriageway where the 'No stopping' sign is visible. Given the current road scenario, be prepared to adjust speed based on the truck's behavior. Overtaking may not be advisable due to the unknown condition ahead. Since visibility is limited by the truck, be cautious of any potential hazards or changes in the road ahead that may not be immediately visible. Prepare for possible lane changes if the truck's behavior suggests it may be turning or if it impedes the ego car's ability to maintain a safe and legal speed."
