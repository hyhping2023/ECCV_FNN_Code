However, there are white and orange reflective traffic cones placed on the right side of the lane, indicating a potential road hazard or construction zone. These cones suggest that the ego vehicle may need to slow down or change lanes to avoid any road work or obstacles ahead. Furthermore, there is a red and white barrier extending across the road, which indicates that the road is closed or there is an obstruction ahead. As a result, vehicles are required to either stop or take an alternative route if one is available. There are no other objects present in the scene."

It is usually colored with bright, contrasting patterns like orange and white stripes to ensure high visibility. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there may be road works, obstacles, or specific directions that the ego vehicle must adhere to. The ego car should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes or follow other traffic control measures as the cone indicates the presence of potential hazards or changes in the usual traffic pattern.",

The presence of the traffic cone indicates to the driver to slow down, proceed with caution, and possibly move away from the cone to avoid the demarcated area.",
