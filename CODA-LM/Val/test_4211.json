A silver van is parked on the right side of the driveway, facing away from the ego car, which obstructs part of the lane and reduces the operational space for the vehicle. Near this van, a pedestrian is standing on the sidewalk, posing a potential risk as they may walk onto the road, necessitating the vehicle to be prepared to stop or slow down. Additionally, a small white dog is seen next to the parked van on the right side of the picture, presenting a possible hazard as it may enter the driveway, requiring the vehicle to be ready to stop or take evasive action. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers visible in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "When approaching the parked van, this vehicle should slow down and watch for signs of pedestrians and dogs possibly entering the driving lane, being ready to stop or safely navigate around them. Additionally, this vehicle should be aware of any signals from pedestrians indicating that they should proceed or providing other instructions. Due to the unpredictable behavior of unattended dogs and the queued traffic up ahead, the vehicle should slow down. Simultaneously, because of the presence of road signs and obstacles, the driver should be prepared to adapt to changes in the road layout or potential merging. Since traffic lights are not visible, it is wise to follow the movements of other vehicles. Lastly, due to low sunlight conditions causing reduced visibility, extra caution is necessary. Drive cautiously, maintain a safe distance from the parked van, and be ready to respond to pedestrians potentially entering the street. Pay attention to changes in traffic lights and respond accordingly; since obstacles may indicate roadwork ahead, heed navigation prompts. Be prepared to merge left if necessary when obstacles result in lane closures. Adopt defensive driving, and be vigilant of the behavior of pedestrians and dogs, which may stop abruptly due to their unpredictability.",
