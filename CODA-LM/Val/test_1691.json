        "description and explanation": "On the road, the following situations are observed in the traffic image:\n\nThere is a yellow maintenance truck occupying the central lane directly in front of the ego car. The presence of this truck is significant because it might slow down or stop without warning due to road work or other maintenance reasons. As a result, our self-driving vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be ready to halt or change lanes if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there are vehicles parked on the right side of the road. These parked vehicles could become a hazard as they might block the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead, and there is a possibility that doors may open unexpectedly or pedestrians could walk out from between the parked cars. Extra caution should be taken when driving past these parked vehicles.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, they are not visible in the image, which means that the autonomous driving system of the ego vehicle cannot rely on them to make decisions. Instead, the system should be on the lookout for other signs like brake lights from vehicles ahead or any unusual traffic patterns to navigate safely.\n\nLastly, there are barriers impacting the driving environment. A median barrier separates the opposite lanes of traffic. This barrier serves the purpose of preventing vehicles from crossing into the opposing traffic flow, making it essential that any overtaking maneuvers are conducted within the same direction of traffic. There are also metal barriers that are installed along the edge of a pedestrian area to the right of the ego vehicle, ensuring the safety of pedestrians by preventing cars from entering the sidewalk and also reducing the space for vehicles on the road.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are mentioned in the dataset, indicating that they are not present or not relevant in this particular traffic image."

Keep a vigilant eye on the parked vehicles on the right for any unexpected obstructions or movement into the roadway. No immediate lane changes seem necessary unless the truck signals an intention to perform maintenance activities that would require using the lane the ego vehicle is in. Since no traffic lights are visible, it is important to remain alert to the behavior of other traffic users. Keep within the lane and observe the road ahead for any traffic signs or changes. Overtake if necessary and safe, but only when the lanes to the left are clear and it is legal to do so."
