Notably, a significant portion of its mixer is extending out into the ego car's lane. This positioning and the dimensions of the construction vehicle could reduce the available space in the ego car's lane, presenting a potential hazard if the ego car were to maintain its current path close to the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there are concrete barriers on the right side of the road, separating the highway from a construction or drop-off area. On the left side, a metal guardrail separates the opposing traffic lanes. These barriers confine the path of travel and necessitate careful maneuvering, especially given the proximity of the construction vehicle to the ego car's path."

Its presence indicates construction activity in the area, which may cause delays or necessitate lane changes to maintain a safe distance from the construction site and workers. The ego vehicle should slow down, be prepared to stop if necessary, and follow any temporary traffic signals or instructions from road workers. It is also important to be aware of potential obstacles and workers in the vicinity and be prepared for sudden stops by vehicles ahead.",
