Although it is partially obscured by darkness and streetlights, it is important to be aware of its presence for spatial awareness, even though it is not affecting the dynamic driving scenario at the moment.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow warning sign on the right, indicating a merge or change in the road ahead. Drivers should be prepared for potential changes in road conditions, which might necessitate a reduction in speed or a lane change.\n\nThe traffic light visible in the image displays a green light for going straight and a red light for turning left. Drivers must adhere to the traffic light instructions, proceed with caution, and be vigilant at the intersection for other road users who may be difficult to see.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are obstacles that could be associated with road construction or lane division. These barriers suggest that the road's width may be reduced, requiring vehicles to maintain their lane and be mindful of workers or changing road conditions.\n\nThe scene is brightly lit by streetlights, but this could potentially reduce visibility due to lens flare or reflections. Vehicles should adjust their headlights to ensure maximum visibility, and drivers should remain alert to any hazards or road users that might be hidden by the glare. The general low-light street illumination also affects visual acuity and reaction time, which should be taken into consideration while driving.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to low visibility and unclear traffic light signals, please drive with caution. If the oncoming traffic signal is indeed red, prepare to stop and observe the behavior of other vehicles for further clues. If the green light is for turning, ensure your vehicle is in the correct lane to comply with the signal instructions. Always be prepared for contingencies in low visibility conditions, especially when traffic signals are not functioning as expected. Be aware of vehicles parked on the right side and prepare for their potential sudden movements. If necessary, slow down to allow sufficient time to deal with any unforeseen situations. While following the green traffic light, also be mindful of potential vision problems caused by street lighting.",
