Additionally, reflective traffic cones are set up on both sides of the driving lane, creating a narrow path that vehicles must follow. These cones suggest road work or alterations to the usual traffic flow, requiring drivers to slow down and be extra cautious. Complementing the cones, temporary yellow barriers with reflective stripes are also in place to guide the traffic and demarcate zones that are off-limits to self-driving vehicles. There are no traffic signs or other objects noted in the image."

The driver must ensure that they do not enter the intersection unless they can safely pass through before the light turns red. When passing through a narrow path defined by traffic cones and barriers, one should reduce speed and remain vigilant, paying attention to any potential road workers or temporary signs. Given the nighttime and wet road conditions, vehicles should turn on their headlights (if not automatic) and drivers should stay alert to any unexpected hazards or changes in road conditions.",
