On the left, a white cement mixer truck is positioned in a neighboring lane to the ego car, moving in the same direction. The truck's partly visible front wheels suggest a potential for lane changing or turning actions, making it a significant element for the ego car to monitor for safety since its actions can directly influence the ego car's trajectory and speed adjustments. Additionally, a red flatbed truck is on the right-hand side, also in a separate lane, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Large trucks like this have significant blind spots, so the ego car must be careful when driving next to or passing it, maintaining an adequate following distance and being prepared for potential changes in speed or lane from the truck.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic light ahead of the ego car, displaying a green signal on the right and a red signal for the left turn, positioned over the intersection. The green light indicates that the ego car can proceed straight or to the right, while the red signal for the left turn lane implies that turning left is currently not permitted. The ego car should remain alert for any potential light changes as it approaches the intersection."

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial construction vehicle is present, specifically a concrete mixer truck, characterized by its rotating drum used for mixing and transporting concrete. The presence of this vehicle on the road is indicative of nearby construction activity. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops due to the construction vehicle possibly making wide turns or stopping unexpectedly at a construction site.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a steady speed and keep a safe distance from the large vehicles. While the green traffic light suggests the ego car may proceed, the driver should remain alert for any potential light changes as the vehicle approaches the intersection, as well as be aware of the large trucks' potential maneuvers. Overtaking should be done with caution, ensuring clear visibility and space. Monitoring the concrete mixer truck's movements is crucial as its position could change suddenly. The vehicle should also be prepared for potential maneuvers by the red flatbed truck. Since the traffic light is green, the ego vehicle can proceed with caution but should stay vigilant for other traffic users and potential signal changes. Overall, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution due to the large vehicles in its vicinity and the current road conditions. Maintain a safe following distance from the red flatbed semi-truck ahead, monitor the white cement mixer truck's movements for potential lane changing, and proceed with caution due to potentially slippery road conditions. Observe the traffic light signals and prepare to stop if it changes to yellow or red. Turning left is not permitted at this time due to the red signal for the left turn lane."
