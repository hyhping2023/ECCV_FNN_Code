These parked cars could reduce the drivable area, necessitating cautious driving to avoid accidents such as car doors suddenly opening or pedestrians appearing unexpectedly from between vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, a person riding a tricycle is occupying the middle of the lane and has their back facing the oncoming vehicles. This scenario is particularly risky, especially at night, as the self-driving vehicle must exercise caution and be prepared to either slow down or stop to avoid a collision."

The vehicle should also turn on and appropriately adjust the headlights to maximize visibility without dazzling other road users, and be aware of any unexpected actions or opened doors of parked vehicles. Drive at a reduced speed according to the current conditions, use appropriate signals to alert pedestrians and oncoming vehicles, and wait for a clear opportunity to pass pedestrians with sufficient clearance to ensure safety. If possible, the vehicle should wait until pedestrians have completely left the straight path before continuing to drive.",
