There is a black debris or object on the road in the bottom left of the image. This obstacle can potentially damage the vehicle or cause the driver to swerve unexpectedly, which is particularly hazardous given the narrow space.

If the car remains stationary, the ego car should carefully navigate around the white car, making sure there is sufficient clearance on both sides. The ego car should approach the debris with caution, slowing down to assess whether it might need to drive around it. Due to potentially slippery conditions, the ego car should proceed at a reduced speed and be prepared for reduced traction. Overall, caution and observance of surrounding vehicles and road conditions should dictate the driving behavior."
