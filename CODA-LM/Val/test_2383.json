It is directly in front of the ego car and occupies most of the lane. This truck's size and position could obscure road hazards or traffic conditions that could impact the ego car's driving decisions.\n   - A silver sedan located on the right, slightly ahead of the ego car. The presence of this vehicle necessitates caution for the ego car when considering a lane change to the right, as it indicates a potential slowdown in traffic flow.\n\n2. **Barriers:**\n   - Concrete barriers on both sides of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating a narrowed path and reduced maneuverability. These barriers require the ego vehicle to stay within the lane and manage its speed to adapt to the restricted space."

            "description and explanation": "A heavy construction vehicle with distinct stripes and warning markings indicating that it is likely part of a roadway maintenance or construction project. The vehicle is equipped with various machinery, which could mean that it operates at slower speeds and may perform sudden movements. Its presence on the road necessitates a cautious approach, maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for potential stops or changes in traffic patterns. For the ego vehicle, this would mean being alert, reducing speed if needed, and not overtaking without clear visibility and ample space to do so safely.",

Stay alert for any brake lights or turn signals. Monitor the sedan to the right to anticipate if it may try to merge into the lane of the ego car. Continuously scan the environment for any new road users or changes in traffic conditions. Do not attempt to overtake unless the adjacent lane is clear and it's safe to do so. Additionally, monitor the passenger car on the right for any changes in speed or lane position, and prepare to respond accordingly. Avoid any lane changes unless the lanes adjacent to the ego car are confirmed to be clear and it's safe to do so. Continuous scanning of the traffic environment and adjusting speed to match the flow of traffic is advised due to the limited visibility and presence of other vehicles. Stay alert due to limited maneuver space because of the concrete barriers and be prepared for slow or stopping traffic."
