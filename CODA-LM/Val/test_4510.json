Although no vehicles or vulnerable road users are present within the scene, we do observe a pertinent traffic sign, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers.\n\nA blue rectangular traffic sign with white text is located on the right side of the road, serving an informational purpose. It provides drivers with direction or facility information, which may be helpful for navigation but doesn't have an immediate impact on driving decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image are presenting a mixed signal; the leftmost lane shows a green light allowing vehicles in this lane to proceed, while red lights for the other lanes signal vehicles there to stop. This distinction is crucial for drivers to determine if they can continue moving or need to halt.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are arrayed in a line, guiding the traffic flow towards the left. This indicates a modification in the road layout or an obstruction ahead that necessitates vehicles to alter their course to the left.\n\nFinally, red and white horizontal barriers stand directly in front of the ego car, signifying that the road straight ahead is blocked. To proceed, vehicles must adhere to the new path marked by the traffic cones diverting to the left, as the direct route onwards is no longer accessible."
