Due to night conditions, reduce speed accordingly and ensure headlights are on for better visibility and to be seen by other road users. The ego car should monitor for any indication from the construction vehicle if it intends to perform any maneuvers. Since there are no other road users or obstructions visible, and it's night time, the ego car should continue with headlights on and maintain a heightened awareness of potential hazards that may be harder to see in low-light conditions."
