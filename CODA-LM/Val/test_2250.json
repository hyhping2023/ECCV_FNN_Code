Continue to drive in the lane indicated by the current road markings. Keep observing the behavior of the SUV ahead and be prepared to adjust speed or direction based on its actions. Maintain a safe following distance. If a pedestrian's path conflicts with your vehicle's trajectory, be prepared to stop. Watch out for vehicles parked on both sides; they may obstruct the road or move suddenly. Observe the road conditions to deal with potential reductions in traction. Monitor oncoming traffic and, assuming no other road users are at risk, continue to follow the green traffic light.",

Due to its unpredictable nature, the presence of this animal may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring the driver to slow down, remain vigilant, and be prepared to stop if the dog moves into the lane of travel. Ensuring the safety of the animal and avoiding sudden maneuvers that could endanger other road users is essential.",
