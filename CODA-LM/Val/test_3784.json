In the context of road safety, bollards are used to control or direct road traffic, such as guiding pedestrian flows or marking out vehicle-restricted areas. They can be seen here lining the side of the road, indicating areas where vehicles should not pass. This bollard could influence future driving behavior by alerting the driver that there is a section of the road (likely the edge) that is separated for safety. The driver should maintain a safe distance from these bollards to prevent scraping the vehicle or causing damage.",

The driving path must follow the guidance of the cones, and the vehicle should prepare for potential abrupt stops or further changes in traffic flow. Headlights and hazard lights should be used if visibility is low, as it appears to be night or low-light conditions. Constant vigilance for temporary signage, workers, or unexpected obstacles is essential."
