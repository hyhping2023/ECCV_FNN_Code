However, there is a significant observation regarding vulnerable road users. There is a group of people standing near the curb on the right side of the road, with one individual stepping onto the road possibly without paying attention to the traffic. The presence and behavior of these pedestrians close to the roadway pose a potential hazard. If one or more individuals were to enter the road unexpectedly, it could lead to a dangerous situation. Therefore, it is critical for the autonomous driving system of the ego vehicle to monitor their movements closely to ensure safety and adjust its driving behavior accordingly."
