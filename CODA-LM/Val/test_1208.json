        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a blue bus located to the right of the observing vehicle, within the same lane, and its brake lights are illuminated. This indicates that the bus could be slowing down or preparing to stop, possibly affecting the flow of traffic. The visibility of the bus's brake lights suggests the observing vehicle should also be ready to decelerate or halt to prevent a collision. Additionally, up ahead in the left lane, a truck is observed carrying cargo and driving ahead of a bus, implying the left lane is currently occupied. With this situation, overtaking might be unsafe or not possible, and thus if a lane change is being considered, heightened caution is advised due to the potential presence of other vehicles in the left lane.\n\nOn the roadside, particularly on the right, there's a speed limit sign indicating a maximum of 20 kilometers per hour alongside a directive for vehicles to change to the left lane. This implies there's a need for speed reduction due to a likely construction zone ahead which may disrupt the usual flow of traffic. \n\nFurthermore, traffic cones are set up on the approaching right-side lane, denoting some form of road work or an adjustment to the usual traffic routing. These cones serve to notify drivers of the altered travel path because of construction and ensure they maneuver safely around any obstructions.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the bus ahead, prepare to reduce speed due to the decrease in the speed limit indicated by temporary signs, and be ready to merge slightly to the left if necessary, while monitoring trucks and other vehicles for any sudden changes in speed or direction. When the bus ahead brakes, proceed with caution and prepare to slow down. Obey the speed reduction limits displayed on the signs, and be ready to respond to changes in traffic flow that may be caused by traffic cones and barriers. Do not attempt to overtake the bus unless the adjacent lane is clear and safe. If a lane change is necessary, maintain a safe distance from the trucks in the left lane. Stay alert to respond to possible unseen road condition changes or further instructions. Your vehicle should immediately slow down to comply with the temporary 20 km/h speed limit in the construction zone, maintain a safe following distance from the bus to prevent sudden stops, and be prepared to deal with any road debris or workers in the construction area. Remaining vigilant and ready to respond to dynamic situations is critical.",
