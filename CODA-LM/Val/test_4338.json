        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements to note. Firstly, there is a large orange-grey construction vehicle parked on the right side of the road, with its rear slightly extending into the roadway. This vehicle is partially obstructing the lane, which may lead to reduced traffic flow or necessitate merging to pass. Additionally, a gray van is visible in the distance ahead, traveling in the same direction as our car. The presence of this car indicates that the road ahead is clear and traffic is flowing, although it may be necessary to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nWorkers are also present near the utility vehicle on the right side of the road, focusing on their task. The workers are near the road and focused on tasks that might inadvertently lead them onto the driving lanes, necessitating extra caution.\n\nA traffic sign is observed on the right side of the road, which is a round blue sign with an arrow pointing to the bottom left. This sign signifies the direction that traffic must follow; vehicles must travel within the designated lanes.\n\nMultiple traffic cones are lined up from the right edge of the road, some extending into our lane and stretching into the center lane. These cones are used to demarcate the work area and guide vehicles to merge right, so as to avoid the working vehicles and workers.\n\nA barrier is present as well, which is a fence with alternating white and red stripes that reaches up to waist height. It extends across the width of the right lane for self-driven vehicles, indicating that the lane is blocked or partially obstructed. This obstacle indicates that drivers should not overtake on the right lane beyond this point and should merge left.\n\nLastly, there is a trash can placed by a worker on the sidewalk, close to the roadway. Although these objects are not on the road, if they are moved or dropped onto the roadway, they could pose a potential risk. As our vehicle passes by, they need to be monitored.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in this image, so this category is ignored in the summary."
