The first traffic cone, which is orange and white, is situated on the right side of the ego car close to the curb. This positioning implies there could be hazards or prohibited driving areas ahead, signifying possible construction or alterations on the roadway. The second traffic cone, similar in color, is positioned on the left side within the lane of the ego vehicle, near the road's edge. The placement of this cone suggests that roadworks or other potential hazards are present, alerting the ego vehicle to stay vigilant and possibly anticipate a diversion or encounter an obstruction ahead. Additionally, there is a blue barrier located on the right side of the road, likely marking the perimeter of a construction area. The barrier signifies that there might be ongoing construction or maintenance work off the roadway, posing a risk of workers or machinery unexpectedly entering the driving path, which calls for increased caution from the ego vehicle."
