The presence of the truck dictates that the ego car should maintain a reasonable speed and a safe following distance due to the truck's potential to obscure the road ahead and the possibility of sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white SUV on the left-hand side of the ego car. This SUV is in the opposite lane, traveling in the opposite direction. The close proximity of the SUV necessitates that the ego car remains within its own lane and ensures a safe distance is kept to prevent any safety risks.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a utility pole adorned with multiple informational signs. However, the visibility of these signs is compromised from the ego car's current angle, rendering the information on them unreadable at the moment. While these signs could hold important details about upcoming road conditions, they don't currently contribute to the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nThere are also yellow and white traffic cones arranged along the right edge of the ego car's lane. These cones indicate the presence of roadworks or potential hazards adjacent to the carriageway. They serve as a caution for the ego car to be vigilant, possibly reduce speed, and to avoid veering towards the roadside where the cones are situated.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are depicted in this traffic image; hence, these categories have no bearing on the ego car's driving behavior in this context."

Moreover, the ego car should continue to monitor the opposing lane for oncoming traffic such as the white SUV and stay within the lane boundaries, avoiding the side of the road where the traffic cones are placed. As the traffic signs are not legible, the ego car should proceed with caution and watch for any new signs or signals that may become visible. Continual situational awareness is important in case road conditions change unexpectedly or other road users' behavior affects the current traffic scenario."
