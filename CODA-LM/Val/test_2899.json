The presence of the bus suggests a lane for larger vehicles that may merge or cross the path of the ego car. It is important to monitor the bus's movement, as it could influence the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary construction barriers in the background, indicating that construction work is taking place. These barriers suggest that there may be road obstructions, lane narrowing, or workers on the road ahead, necessitating a reduction in speed and increased caution from the ego car.\n\nAn excavator arm is also visible, crossing into the foreground, which is likely associated with the ongoing construction. The presence of heavy machinery such as the excavator presents immediate and unpredictable hazards, requiring the ego car to either stop or proceed with extreme caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."

Maintain a safe distance from the bus ahead and be attentive to construction workers or unexpected obstacles that might emerge from blind spots created by the construction equipment."
