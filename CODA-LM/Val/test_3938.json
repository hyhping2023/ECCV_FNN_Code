Caution is advised due to the proximity of the SUV, as it may change lanes or decelerate unexpectedly, which could lead to a potential collision if not monitored closely by our autonomous system.\n\nAdditionally, there is a significant glare from streetlights and headlights that might be impacting the visibility of the road ahead. This glare necessitates extra caution when driving as it could impair the autonomous systemâ€™s ability to recognize other road users or changes in road conditions, which makes it prudent to reduce the vehicle's speed and proceed with heightened alertness."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the SUV ahead, be prepared to slow down if the SUV decelerates, and remain alert for any possible lane changes by the SUV. Your vehicle should also reduce speed and stay in open lanes to allow extra space for workers or unexpected obstacles. In the absence of visible traffic lights, rely on road signs and situational awareness to navigate through the area. Be aware of any potential obstructions that construction obstacles or changes in the road may bring. Moreover, in conditions of reduced visibility, your vehicle should slow down to ensure a safe reaction time.",
