Firstly, there is a truck with yellow rear markings parked on the right side of the street, facing away from the ego vehicle's direction. Although it does not directly affect traffic flow, maintaining a safe distance is recommended due to the potential for unexpected maneuvers, especially since it is near road maintenance activities.\n\nAdditionally, a white truck is parked on the side of the rightmost lane, with its rear facing the ego vehicle. This truck is obstructing the rightmost lane, which may require the ego vehicle to change lanes if it intends to use that lane.\n\nA group of individuals wearing hi-visibility clothing is working on the roadside near the parked street sweeping vehicle and truck. These workers are engaged in road maintenance and could unexpectedly enter the roadway, necessitating reduced speed and readiness to stop or maneuver for their safety.\n\nAn overhead electronic traffic signboard is present but currently turned off, so it does not influence driving behavior at the moment. However, its presence suggests that it could display dynamic messages under different road or traffic conditions.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are lined up on the right side of the road, in front of the roadside work area, extending towards the street sweeping vehicle. These cones indicate a lane narrowing or closure ahead, requiring the ego vehicle to ensure it is in the correct lane to pass safely, which may involve merging to the left if the right lane is closed. Additional traffic cones are placed on the sidewalk, marking the boundary of the work area and enhancing the visibility of the caution zone.\n\nLastly, there is machinery next to the truck on the sidewalk, related to the ongoing work. While this machinery does not directly affect the ego vehicle's path, it signifies the need for caution when driving through the area."
