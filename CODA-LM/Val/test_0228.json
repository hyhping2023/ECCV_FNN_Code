        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several relevant road users and signs affecting the ego car's driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there is a line of vehicles ahead on the same lane as the ego car, which includes various cars and a maintenance truck with an arrow board indicating a merge to the left. These vehicles are slowing down the ego car due to their reduced speed and the lane closure indicated by the maintenance truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a truck on the adjacent lane to the left, slightly ahead of the ego car, which might indicate a potential lane change or overtaking maneuver. The ego car should monitor this truck's position to anticipate any lane merging and adjust its speed or position accordingly.\n\nAn arrow board trailer is also attached to a maintenance vehicle on the right side of the ego vehicle, with arrow lights indicating a left lane merge. This suggests that the right lane is likely closed ahead for maintenance work, and vehicles are required to merge to the left.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a portable \"Right Lane Closed Ahead\" sign is visible on the shoulder to the right. This sign reinforces the message from the arrow board trailer that the right lane is closed ahead, necessitating a lane merge.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the right side of the ego car's lane. These cones signal the start of a lane closure and direct traffic to merge left. They physically delineate the area of the lane closure, guiding the ego car to adjust its position on the road.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."

Its primary color is often bright orange, complemented with white bands for increased visibility, especially in low-light conditions. These cones are used to mark areas where road users should not go, often indicating temporary traffic changes, hazardous conditions, or road work zones. When driving, the presence of a traffic cone requires the driver to be attentive and to maneuver around the cone, ensuring they do not enter the restricted area that the cone is marking. Seeing traffic cones on the road generally suggests that extra caution should be exercised, and the driver may need to reduce speed and prepare for potential changes in traffic patterns.",

Always be prepared to react to the unexpected movements from other road users and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead."
