    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should drive cautiously, maintaining a safe speed to respond to any sudden movements from people near the parking area. Pay attention to parked vehicles for signs of doors opening or other indications. The lead vehicle should stay alert and be prepared to stop if necessary. Be careful and maintain a safe distance from pedestrians who may be distracted. Watch for any dynamic changes around pedestrians or stationary objects. Navigate within marked lanes, avoiding areas with safety barriers. Continue to monitor the surroundings to detect other road users or changes in conditions not shown in the current image.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone. Traffic cones are typically used to mark areas on roads or footpaths that are to be avoided due to hazards, construction, or alterations in the flow of traffic. They are brightly colored for high visibility, often in orange, with a white reflective sleeve for increased visibility at night or in low-light conditions. The presence of a traffic cone indicates that the vehicle should steer clear of the area that the cone is protecting or delineating. In a driving scenario, encountering a traffic cone would likely necessitate a change in the vehicle's course to avoid the marked area, or it could indicate upcoming road work or temporary changes in traffic patterns.",

The blue tarp is typically used to waterproof and protect materials from environmental exposure, such as rain or debris. While the exact contents under the tarp cannot be determined, the presence of this object in a driving scenario suggests that there may be storage or inactive construction equipment present. The vehicle should take caution when driving near such objects, as the area may be part of an active work zone or could contain materials that are not secured.",

Large stones or barriers like this are often used as permanent or temporary traffic control measures to block vehicle access or to provide a physical boundary between traffic lanes or zones. The weight and stability of a concrete stone make it suitable for ensuring that the delineated areas are not easily disturbed by vehicles. In a driving scenario, this object would require the driver to maintain a safe distance and potentially alter their path to avoid collision, particularly given that such barriers may not be immediately visible from within the car due to their low height and color which might blend with the road surface.",
