        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects which influence the driving dynamics of the ego car. Firstly, there is a yellow forklift on the right side of the ego car, facing the direction the ego car is traveling. The orientation and position of the forklift indicate it may be planning to cross or enter into the ego car's trajectory, posing a potential interruption to the traffic flow. Additionally, a construction truck is partially visible on the left side of the image. It is positioned across both the road and the sidewalk, facing away from the ego car's direction. This obstructs part of the lane and may require the ego vehicle to adjust its path or speed if the truck were to move unexpectedly.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers identified in the image; however, we do observe a section with construction-related disturbances on the right side. The presence of the forklift and what appears to be construction activities beyond a pink barrier wall signify possible ongoing construction work. This could lead to alterations in road conditions and the normal flow of traffic, necessitating cautious and adaptive driving by the ego car."
