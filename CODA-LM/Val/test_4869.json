Firstly, there are several vehicles parked on both sides of the road, including a white car closest to our vehicle on the left side and several other cars along the roadside. These parked vehicles reduce the effective width of the driving lane and pose a potential obstruction if they suddenly pull out.\n\nIn addition, several cyclists are seen on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. Cyclists can be unpredictable, potentially swerving to avoid obstacles or changing direction suddenly, which poses a hazard to our vehicle.\n\nA blue information sign indicating a road split ahead is mounted above a pedestrian crossing warning sign. This signifies an upcoming intersection and pedestrian crosswalk, alerting us to potential pedestrian activity and advising us to drive cautiously.\n\nThere are temporary obstacles on the right side of the road, possibly due to construction or maintenance work. These obstacles may indicate changes in traffic patterns that our vehicle will need to navigate through. Additionally, many boxes and debris are piled up on the right side of these temporary obstacles, presenting potential hazards that could enter the road and need to be closely monitored."
