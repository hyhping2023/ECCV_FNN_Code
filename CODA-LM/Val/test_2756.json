However, there is a traffic sign that is a red and white prohibition sign, likely indicating 'no entry' or a similar restriction. It is mounted on a post at head height in the center of a two-lane entrance or exit and is well-lit by vehicle headlights, ensuring visibility even in low-light conditions. This sign is important as it controls access and indicates that vehicles, including the ego car, are not allowed to proceed beyond this point for legal and safety reasons.\n\nAdditionally, there are several orange traffic cones with reflective stripes arranged to block the roadway ahead. These cones serve as a warning for a closed or restricted path that the ego car must not pass, possibly due to construction, an event, or a hazard.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones are yellow and black striped barriers on both sides of the cones, emphasizing the road closure. These barriers provide a strong visual cue that the path is inaccessible and instruct the ego car not to continue in that direction.\n\nLastly, the lighting conditions are dim with some ambient light from building signs in the background, which could affect visibility. This situation necessitates the use of headlights by the ego car if they are not already on and calls for increased caution due to the possibility of unseen hazards."

Its orange color and white bands are designed to be highly visible during daytime and at night, and it may also be equipped with flashing lights.
