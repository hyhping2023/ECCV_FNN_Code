Be vigilant for any other road users that may be obscured by the parked vehicles and be prepared to stop or maneuver safely should anyone step out into the road. Due to limited visibility and the presence of parked vehicles on the right, the ego car should reduce speed and prepare for any unforeseen obstacles or movements from the parked cars. Additionally, increasing following distance, if a lead car is present, would be advisable to account for longer stopping distances in wet or unclear road conditions. Always monitor for any other road users that might be obscured by the weather or camera quality. Maintain a cautious speed considering the wet road conditions and keep a safe following distance from the gray van ahead. Monitor the parked white sedan for any signs of movement and be prepared to adjust the ego car's path if necessary to safely navigate around potentially opening doors or the car pulling out. Continual situation awareness is critical due to the reduced visibility and potential for vehicles to behave unpredictably on wet roads."
