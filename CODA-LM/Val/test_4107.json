However, there are two instances involving vulnerable road users. The first instance is of two pedestrians who are walking on the side of the road to the right of the ego vehicle. They are facing away from the ego car, suggesting that they are not a direct threat, but it is advised to remain cautious as they are in close proximity to the roadway. The second instance involves an individual pedestrian who is ahead on the opposite side of the road, walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The distance between the pedestrian and the ego car, thanks to the road's width, indicates that there is likely no immediate risk from this pedestrian's presence."

Constantly monitor both sides for any potential road users entering the driving lane and adhere to traffic laws and local speed limits. Maintain a vigilant speed while watching for any changes in the pedestrians' behavior. There are no immediate obstructions or traffic control devices that would require action from the ego vehicle. Continue to monitor the surroundings for any unforeseen events as the situation with the pedestrians could change. Maintain a safe distance from the pedestrians, reduce speed to allow for greater reaction time in the event of sudden pedestrian movement. Continue to monitor the road conditions due to the wet surface, adjust speed accordingly, and prepare for increased stopping distances."
