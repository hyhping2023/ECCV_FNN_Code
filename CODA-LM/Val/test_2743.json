There's an individual located on the right side of the road who is partially obscuring the path of the ego car, characterized by a dark, non-reflective appearance that makes them challenging to notice under low-light conditions. This situation is particularly perilous as the individual's proximity to the road increases the possibility of them entering the roadway unexpectedly, hence presenting a potential hazard for the ego car. No other types of road users or objects, such as vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene."

This individual appears to be standing at the side of the road in the darkness, illuminated by vehicle headlights or other lighting sources. It is crucial for the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with heightened caution, maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to stop if the pedestrian steps onto the roadway. The presence of a pedestrian in this context suggests potential unpredictable movement, thus the driver must be attentive and ready to respond to ensure safety.",
