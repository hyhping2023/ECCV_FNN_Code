This van may slow down or stop depending on the traffic light situation, requiring the ego car to be prepared to reduce speed or stop accordingly. Maintaining a safe following distance and staying alert for sudden stops or turns is essential. Another white van on the right side of the road appears to be parked or moving slowly. This van's position could affect the ego car's lane changes or merging decisions, especially if it is entering traffic flow.\n\nRed traffic lights are visible ahead on the right side of the road. This requires the ego vehicle to prepare to stop at the intersection or traffic light ahead. The ego car must approach cautiously and be prepared for any signal change, stopping if the light turns red.\n\nOther objects in the scene include shopfronts and streetlights alongside the road, with glare from a light source reducing visibility temporarily. This necessitates increased caution and potentially slower speeds."
