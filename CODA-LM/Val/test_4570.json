        "description and explanation": "The scene includes a set of parked vehicles on the right side of the road. These vehicles are not well-lit and may partially block the lane without any visible lights or indicators to alert oncoming traffic. The presence of these vehicles requires cautious driving as they could restrict the available driving space for the ego car and represent a risk if any of their occupants were to open doors or move around the vehicles unexpectedly. This risk is heightened by the poor lighting conditions, making it challenging to spot such movements and particularly hazardous if these vehicles are parked illegally or in an unexpected manner.\n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians located on the right side, near the parked vehicles. They are difficult to discern due to the low light conditions. These pedestrians have the potential to step into the driving lane, which could pose a safety risk. Consequently, the ego car must be vigilant and ready to respond by stopping or slowing down if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, there might be debris or assorted objects lying next to the parked vehicles or near the parked truck on the side of the road. The exact nature of these items is unclear due to the low lighting. As a precaution, the ego vehicle should keep a safe distance from the side of the road to avoid the unforeseen hazards these objects could present. They could require the driver to perform sudden maneuvers to ensure safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this traffic image. The complete focus is on the parked vehicles, pedestrians, and potential debris in crafting safe and careful driving strategies for the ego car."

Be vigilant for any other road users that might be hidden behind the truck or any debris that might be present on the road. Consider using appropriate signals to alert other road users of intentions to navigate around the parked truck."
