        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable categories of road users and objects that are crucial for autonomous driving decision-making. Firstly, there is a traffic light that is currently green for the lane in which the vehicle is positioned, while the traffic light for the perpendicular direction is showing red. This green traffic light signifies that the vehicle has the authorization to proceed through the intersection, indicating a clear path forward without the need for stopping or yielding to cross traffic at this moment.\n\nSecondly, the presence of orange traffic cones on the right side of the lane is observed. These cones suggest potential road construction or a lane closure ahead. The positioning of these cones serves as a warning for the vehicle to prepare for a possible narrowing of the lane or a detour. It implies that the vehicle must navigate carefully around these cones to continue its journey without interruption.\n\nNo other categories, such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects, have been mentioned in the data, indicating their absence in this specific traffic scenario. This summary encapsulates the current situation and the necessary considerations for autonomous driving behavior in this context."

Stay alert for any road workers or additional signs that may indicate the scope of the work area.

Drivers should take note of this cone and avoid the area it designates, potentially indicating road work, an obstacle, or another hazard. The ego car should steer clear of the lane where the cone is placed, if safe to do so, and continue driving in an open lane.",
