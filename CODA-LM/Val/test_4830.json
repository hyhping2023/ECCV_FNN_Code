A white van is parked on the left side of the road, facing the direction of our vehicle. This van could potentially move or its door might open, affecting traffic flow.\n  2. A dark-colored pickup truck is directly in front of our vehicle, heading in the same direction. It requires maintaining a safe following distance.\n  3. A blue pickup truck is moving to the right side of the road. Dynamic vehicles like this need monitoring due to their movement and potential lane changes.\n  4. A white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, facing our car with its front visible to us. This parked car occupies part of the road, reducing available driving space, necessitating careful driving.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  1. A pedestrian stands on the left side of the road, close to the parked white van. This pedestrian might jaywalk, so the vehicle must be prepared for sudden movements.\n  2. A person on the right, wearing red, might be preparing to cross the street or interact with a street vendor. The unclear intentions of this person warrant close surveillance for safety.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  1. Temporary obstacles have been placed on the right side of the road, possibly for construction or roadside activities, narrowing the available road space and possibly necessitating lane changes or merging of traffic flows.\n  2. On the left side, a temporary fence and obstacles are present, separating a construction or activity area from traffic flow. These obstacles shape the traffic lanes, may cause the passage to narrow, and thus require a reduction in speed and increased attention.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  1. On the right edge of the road, there are baskets and debris, with a person dressed in red standing next to them. These items, if moved onto the road, could become hazards, suggesting nearby pedestrian activity."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the wet road conditions, drivers should reduce speed and maintain a cautious pace when approaching parked vehicles. Be prepared to stop and yield to pedestrians, especially near parked box trucks, and be vigilant for any movement of people or objects at the roadside. Maintain a moderate speed while monitoring pedestrians and those wearing red intending to cross the street. Stay alert for unpredictable movements of pedestrians and pickup trucks, as they may suddenly change their course. Approach areas with obstacles carefully, anticipate possible detours, and pay attention to signs that may be present but not very clear in the image. Given the slippery roads, keep a safe following distance, and be prepared for a longer braking distance.",
