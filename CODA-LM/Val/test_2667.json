        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals several critical details relevant to driving safely. Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a white sedan that is stationary, dictating that the ego vehicle must remain stationary until this car moves. On the right side of the road, a yellow excavator partially obstructs the right lane, indicating road work ahead and requiring caution and potentially merging to the left. Further ahead on the right, a stationary green bus aligned with the curb suggests the presence of potential pedestrians or future movement, necessitating monitoring. Additionally, several buses are visible ahead to the left, partially stationary or moving slowly due to roadwork, implying potential pedestrian activity and the need for the ego vehicle to be prepared to yield.\n\nA traffic light positioned on the overhead structure above the road displays a red signal, requiring the ego vehicle to stop. Multiple orange traffic cones are lined up, constricting the right side of the road near the excavator, indicating a reduction in lane width and guiding traffic away from the construction zone. Temporary yellow-colored traffic barriers span the construction area alongside the cones, serving to protect the work zone and guide traffic safely; hence, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from these barriers."

Additionally, be aware of the bus' possible movement and pedestrians that may emerge around the bus when the light changes. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the white sedan ahead, be prepared for sudden stops, and navigate the disruptions cautiously. With the roadwork and possibility of buses merging, the ego car should slow down, monitor the traffic signals for direction, and be ready to yield to other traffic and possible pedestrians in the area. Overtaking should not be attempted until a safe and clear lane is available beyond the roadwork area."
