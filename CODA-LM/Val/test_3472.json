The truck's position reduces the usable road space, necessitating careful maneuvering by the autonomous vehicle. Pedestrians are observed walking on the right sidewalk, and while none are on the road, their proximity to the roadway means the self-driving car must monitor them closely in case they step onto the pavement. Additionally, several workers in high-visibility clothing are present around a tool cart and parked cars, which could pose a hazard if they enter the roadway, so extra caution is needed when passing to ensure their safety.\n\nA traffic sign is visible, a circular blue sign with a white arrow pointing to the upper right, indicating that traffic must follow a turn or merge ahead. Traffic cones and barrier tape are set up to guide traffic away from a construction area and into the correct lane, signaling that the right lane ahead is closed and a merge to the left is required. A temporary barrier with white and red stripes is stretched between the traffic cones, further narrowing the road and marking the area that vehicles should not enter, making it necessary for vehicles to merge.\n\nOther objects include several large trash bins placed on the sidewalk to the right, behind the traffic cones, which are part of the work zone and contribute to road restrictions. There are also temporary wooden protective structures around the trees on the sidewalk, which are part of the construction site setup and may obstruct pedestrians' view of the roadway, although they do not affect the path of the self-driving cars. Traffic lights are not mentioned in the image, suggesting there are none in view."

Due to indicated mandatory direction and lane closures, be prepared to merge left. Maintain a safe distance from trucks, and be ready to stop if pedestrians suddenly enter the roadway. Drivers should watch for pedestrians on the left and tanker trucks parked on the right, vigilant for pedestrians who may cross narrow lanes. Wet road conditions require an increased braking distance, so drive carefully. The vehicle should also avoid construction zones marked with traffic cones and barriers. Slow down to safely navigate around public utility work areas, with some lanes being blocked be prepared to merge left, and stay highly vigilant for workers and any pedestrians who may be active near the work site. The vehicle should pay attention to the flashing lights of utility vehicles and any gestures from the workers, which may indicate changes in the work area that could affect traffic flow.",
