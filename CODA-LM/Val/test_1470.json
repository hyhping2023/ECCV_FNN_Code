The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle due to its size and be prepared for unexpected stops or changes in speed.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a pedestrian is walking parallel to the road but is close to the driving lane. The proximity of the pedestrian to the driving lane poses a potential risk if they were to unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nAlthough the rear lights of the truck are red, there are no traffic signal lights visible in the image. This means that the ego car should make driving decisions based on the truck's behavior and other traffic rules, rather than relying on traffic signals.\n\nTemporary metal barriers are present on the right side of the road, which likely indicates road work or a closed lane ahead. These barriers suggest that there may be a reduction in road width or a potential hazard, necessitating caution, a possible reduction in speed, or a lane change.\n\nAdditionally, there is construction or debris located on the right side behind the barriers. This adds complexity to the roadside environment and indicates the presence of potential hazards or obstructions near the roadway that could impact traffic flow or require evasive actions."
