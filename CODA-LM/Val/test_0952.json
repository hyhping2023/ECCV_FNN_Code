The likelihood of an obstruction or the intention to turn could explain the vehicle's behavior. As a result, the ego car should be prepared to decelerate and ensure there's sufficient distance between them and the black car.\n\nAdditionally, several vehicles, primarily silver and white, are parked along the right side of the road. These are positioned parallelly, implying that they are stationary and not part of the active traffic. Their presence, however, impacts the drivable road space, necessitating caution while passing by.\n\nA pedestrian is spotted under a shelter on the right side of the road, who seems to have no intention to cross the road at the moment. Nevertheless, the ego car should continue to observe the pedestrian for any unexpected movements which might require adjustments in driving.\n\nThere is a blue traffic sign with white arrows and text positioned above a temporary shelter on the right, giving directions. While it serves the purpose of guiding towards various locations, this sign does not have any immediate influence on how the ego car should behave.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road. These cones indicate there may be a road closure ahead or an ongoing work zone, signaling the ego car to stay alert and be prepared to shift to the left lane if merging is required.\n\nClose by, barrier tapes are established around a zone on the right side, which could denote a work area or a space off-limits for vehicular traffic. The barrier setup advises the ego vehicle to maintain its course on the left to bypass this restricted section.\n\nTraffic lights and other objects in the scene have not been reported and thus are of no concern."
