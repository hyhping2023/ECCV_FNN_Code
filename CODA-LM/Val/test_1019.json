The vehicles are noticed to be in close proximity, which suggests that there are heavy traffic conditions. Due to this, the driving behavior of our vehicle, the ego car, must be adjusted to be more cautious. The close spacing of the vehicles necessitates a reduction in speed and an increase in following distance to prevent any potential rear-end collisions."

It has clearly visible brake lights, which indicates that it may be slowing down or coming to a stop. The size and behavior of this vehicle will necessitate the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary to avoid a close encounter or collision.",
