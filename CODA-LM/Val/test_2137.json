The truck is carrying what seems to be an oversized load, which affects the navigable space for the ego vehicle. As a result of the truck's size and positioning, the autonomous driving system would need to exercise caution and possibly adjust its speed to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian on the right side of the road. This individual is walking parallel to the direction of traffic and is on a pedestrian path or sidewalk. While the pedestrian is currently not on the roadway, their presence should be continually monitored. This is to ensure that any unexpected entry onto the road by the pedestrian can be responded to promptly by the autonomous driving system to ensure safety.\n\nThe rest of the categories including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in the traffic image, indicating no additional elements or road users need to be accounted for in this scenario."

Monitor the pedestrian on the right and be ready to react if they enter the roadway. Continue to observe the road ahead for any changes in traffic signs, lights, or road conditions that may require action. No overtaking should be attempted unless there is clear visibility and space to do so safely, and there is a clear and legal opportunity to overtake."
