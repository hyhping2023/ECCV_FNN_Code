The van's movements are important to monitor as they could influence the ego car's speed and following distance. It is essential to maintain a safe distance to account for potential sudden stops or changes in the van's speed.\n\nTo the right of the frame, slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a motorcyclist who appears to be in motion. The motorcyclist's presence necessitates careful observation since they might change lanes or be less stable than vehicles with four wheels.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light showing green at the intersection ahead of the ego car. The green light signals that the ego car can continue moving forward, but it is important to stay alert for any changes in the light and for other vehicles that may attempt to run a yellow light from the cross traffic.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, there are orange traffic cones lined up, marking the boundary of the driving lane. These cones indicate areas that are off-limits for driving, effectively reducing the width of the usable lane and requiring the driver to exercise caution to remain within the designated driving space.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
