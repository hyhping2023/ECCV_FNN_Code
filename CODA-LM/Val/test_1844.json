Observe the sedan's behavior on the left for any lane-changing or speed adjustments. Continue to follow the road as it curves to the right, adhering to the mandatory direction sign and staying in the current lane, all while obeying the green traffic light and proceeding with caution given the nighttime driving conditions. Avoid any lane changes to the right before confirming the white car's position and intentions. Since the traffic light is green, continue moving forward but remain vigilant for any changes in signals or road conditions."
