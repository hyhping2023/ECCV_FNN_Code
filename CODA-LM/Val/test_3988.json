It is positioned off to the side of the road and is not an immediate hazard to vehicular traffic. However, as an inanimate object positioned near the roadside, it is important for the driver of the ego car to acknowledge its presence and maintain a safe distance to ensure that if the spool were to become an obstacle due to unforeseen circumstances, such as being moved onto the roadway, there would be ample time to react and navigate around it safely.",
