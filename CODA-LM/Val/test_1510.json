Stay alert for any changes in the road conditions or unexpected obstacles that may appear. Maintain current lane, adjust speed to accommodate for the wet road conditions, watch for any potential movements from other vehicles, especially the one following the oncoming traffic. Keep a safe distance from the barriers to the right and be prepared to react to the behavior of the oncoming vehicle and the vehicle behind it. Due to limited visibility caused by the oncoming vehicle's headlights and the wet road conditions, the ego car should reduce speed and increase following distance to ensure sufficient reaction time. The driver should also be prepared to adjust the lane position slightly to the right if necessary to avoid glare while staying within the lane boundaries marked by the barriers. Additionally, the use of low beam headlights can reduce glare for oncoming traffic and improve the driver's own visibility under these conditions."
