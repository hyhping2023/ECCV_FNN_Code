The presence of the pedestrian is critical as they may step into the path of the autonomous vehicle, which requires the vehicle to reduce speed and be prepared to stop to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic signs visible. The first is a blue square sign on the left side of the road with white text and symbols, providing directions to different destinations. This sign is important for navigation, especially if the vehicle's route includes a turn ahead. The second sign, located on the right side next to the pedestrian walkway, indicates that vehicles are not allowed to make a right turn at the intersection ahead. This sign is crucial as it restricts the autonomous vehicle's available maneuvers, prohibiting it from making right turns at the upcoming intersection.\n\nFurthermore, several orange and white traffic cones are set up on the left side of the lane, creating a temporary barrier that suggests the driving surface is narrowing or diverting. These cones are essential for guiding the autonomous vehicle to adjust its course to avoid restricted or potentially hazardous areas.\n\nThere are no other vehicles, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "According to the instructions from the traffic signs and the placement of traffic cones, our vehicle should maintain the current driving route and prepare to merge left as indicated by the signs. At the same time, it is important to observe changes in the traffic lights and slow down as necessary to accommodate potential stops or lane merging. Our vehicle should also be cautious of any changes caused by shadows or objects near the traffic cones. We should continue to go straight, follow the lane markings, and avoid the area delineated by the traffic cones on the left. The driver should also be prepared to stop or yield at the upcoming intersection if necessary, while bearing in mind the observed traffic signs that indicate no right turn is permitted. If pedestrians step onto the crosswalk intending to cross the street, our vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop. If our vehicle is in the right-hand lane, and the lane ahead is closed, we should safely prepare to merge left.",

Its bright color and reflective material make it highly visible to drivers, and in this scenario, it would indicate to the ego car to avoid driving in that direction and to stay in the appropriate lane to maintain safe driving conditions.",
