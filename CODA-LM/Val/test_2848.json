Due to its close proximity and potential movement choices, it could affect how the ego vehicle maneuvers. Various other vehicles, including cars and utility vehicles, are present both in motion and stationary across and beyond the intersection. These could influence the ego vehicle's decision to proceed based on their movement and the traffic signals.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene include pedestrians with a dog who are crossing the street in front of the ego car; they have the right of way and thus directly impact the ego vehicle's movement. Moreover, one cyclist is crossing the intersection from left to right and another from right to left, both of whom the ego car should yield to for their safety. Additionally, pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, one walking a dog, could also affect driving behavior if they step onto the road.\n\nThe traffic signs observed include a red stop sign atop the traffic light at the intersection, indicating that it is not permitted to cross or enter the intersection at this time. However, no immediate traffic signs affecting the ego vehicle's immediate behavior are visible.\n\nThe traffic light for the ego car's direction is red, requiring the ego vehicle to stop until it turns green.\n\nTraffic cones are placed ahead to the left and right sides of the car, on the sidewalks at the corner of the intersection, signaling areas to avoid potentially due to construction or road work. This suggests the ego vehicle should exercise caution, particularly when making turns, to avoid areas indicated by cones.\n\nNo barriers or other objects affecting the ego car's driving behavior are mentioned in this scene."
