A silver/grey car is traveling in the same direction in the right-most lane, a white car is parked on the right side of the road, and a light-colored sedan is in the left lane, also moving in the same direction. Ahead in the right lane, there's a silver hatchback slightly in front of the ego car, and a distant red truck is visible on a merging road from the left. While none of these cars poses an immediate threat, their presence means the ego vehicle must remain vigilant for possible lane changes or speed adjustments from these vehicles, especially because a road work sign is indicating construction ahead with a lowered speed limit of 20 km/h. This sign is coupled with a directional arrow sign, signaling that the ego car will need to merge left due to upcoming lane changes in the road layout.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones are set up to lead traffic to the left, which suggests that a part of the roadway is closed ahead. This will likely reduce the number of lanes and require the ego car to merge left. Complementing this, orange and white striped barriers signify a lane closure ahead, starting from the construction sign and extending left, confirming that the ego car will need to shift lanes. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects of note in the current field of view."

Moreover, the ego vehicle should be ready to merge left according to the redirected traffic pattern created by the traffic cones, while continuing to monitor the parked white car and the distant red truck for any changes in their status. Ongoing situation awareness is crucial as the ego vehicle needs to adapt both position and speed in anticipation of the construction zone and the actions of other road users."
