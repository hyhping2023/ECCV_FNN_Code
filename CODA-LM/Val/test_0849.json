        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a few vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers that interact with the autonomous vehicle's driving environment.\n\nStarting with the vehicles, there is a white car parked on the left side of the road, facing away from our vehicle. While this parked car does not immediately impact the driving route, it's important for the autonomous vehicle to monitor it in case it begins to pull out into traffic. Also on the road ahead, there is a small car directly in front of the ego vehicle. It is occupying the center of the lane and its taillights are on, indicating it is in motion. The distance and speed of the self-driving car will need to be adjusted to account for this car's presence to maintain a safe following gap.\n\nAs for the vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian on the right pedestrian walkway, which means the autonomous vehicle must be prepared for the possibility of the pedestrian stepping onto the road. Additionally, a bicycle is found stationed on the right side, next to the white barrier, but not obstructing the lane. Its presence suggests that there could be cyclists nearby, warranting continued vigilance from the autonomous vehicle.\n\nConcerning traffic signs, there is a blue \"Go Straight\" sign on the right-hand side of the road, guiding drivers to continue ahead without any turns. This directs the autonomous vehicle to maintain its course along the road.\n\nTraffic cones are also present, with a black and yellow cone situated at the right edge of the roadway. Although it doesnâ€™t constitute a direct danger, it signals to the autonomous vehicle that there may be roadwork or upcoming hindrances.\n\nBarriers are visible as well. White barriers are aligned on the right to delineate the pedestrian walkway from the flow of traffic, indicating a no-drive zone for the vehicle. On the left side, there is a black and yellow bollard acting as a traffic calming measure that narrows the traffic lane, requiring careful navigation.\n\nNo traffic lights or other objects are noted in this traffic image, as those categories are empty in the provided data."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or change lanes to avoid the truck ahead. Pay attention to traffic cones and obstacles, which may indicate road construction or obstructions ahead. It is recommended to continuously observe any changes in the driving environment. Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, proceed straight following the traffic signs, and be alert to changes in road conditions at all times. Due to the traffic cones and obstacles, avoid changing lanes to the right. Continue to monitor for cyclists or pedestrians who may enter the road from the right.",
