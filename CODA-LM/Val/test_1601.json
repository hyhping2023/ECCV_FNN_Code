Vehicles of this type are typically heavy and have limited maneuverability, which requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential slow movement or sudden stops from the construction vehicle. The size of the vehicle may also affect visibility, so caution should be exercised to ensure that there are no blind spots obstructing the view of the road ahead or other road users.",

Keep an eye on the red truck to the left for any changes in its movements, which may affect lane-changing options. Be watchful for pedestrians or obstacles that may emerge from between the parked cars on the right. Continue monitoring the road ahead for any unexpected situations, adjusting speed and position accordingly for safety. Due to the potential for reduced road width and obstacles caused by the cement mixer truck and parked vehicles, the ego car should reduce speed to prepare for potential stops or slow-downs. The vehicle should not attempt to overtake the mixer unless it can do so safely, with full visibility and confirmation that the opposing lane is clear of oncoming traffic. Additionally, the ego car should be alert for any movements from the parked vehicles or unforeseen road users emerging from between parked cars."
