        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are a few notable road users and their activities. On the road, there is a lineup of vehicles moving in the opposite direction, which includes a white vehicle at the lead. These vehicles are on the other side of a central divider and, as such, do not interfere with our car's travel path. The self-driving system recognizes that these vehicles are not directly influencing its driving decisions because of the physical separation provided by the road's central divider.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users to be mindful of. A cyclist is spotted at the right edge of our lane, traveling in the same direction as our car. The autonomous driving system must be prepared for any sudden movements or obstacles the cyclist may encounter, which might necessitate a change in the vehicle's path to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, there is a person with a cart positioned on the right shoulder of the road ahead of our vehicle. The presence of this individual near the driving lane represents a potential risk, as there is the possibility they might unexpectedly enter the lane. Therefore, the self-driving system must be cautious and prepared to react accordingly to avoid any hazards.\n\nThe traffic image does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Therefore, these categories have been omitted from the driving scene summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current road conditions, the vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and speed, taking into account the cyclists and pedestrians by the roadside. As the vehicle approaches a traffic light, it should adjust its speed based on the traffic signal that is not yet visible. Monitoring oncoming traffic flow is crucial for proactive driving decisions. Overall, the vehicle should continue to travel in the rightmost lane to ensure a safe distance from cyclists and to be ready to respond to the potential movements of oncoming traffic or pedestrians. Be cautious when approaching cart pushers and dogs, and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. Considering that the road conditions are favourable and the traffic is moderate, provide at least a 3-foot clearance when passing. Watch out for potential sun glare, and slow down if necessary to maintain visibility and safely accommodate road users.",
