The truck is distinctive with its cylindrical mixing drum. Its size and potential for dropping debris make it a key consideration, so maintaining a safe following distance is crucial.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, slightly ahead, there is a blue rectangular highway information sign indicating an exit or route information. This sign helps the ego car anticipate lane changes if the route requires taking an exit soon.\n\nAdditionally, there are concrete barriers to the right of the ego vehicle, separating the main road from exit lanes or adjoining roads. These barriers limit the available space for maneuvering and merging, thus requiring the ego vehicle to maintain lane discipline."

This type of vehicle is often wider and slower-moving than ordinary traffic, which might require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and prepare for potential stops or slow movement. The size of the vehicle also means that visibility of road conditions ahead may be reduced, and the ego car should be cautious when considering an overtaking maneuver.",

Be prepared for reduced visibility due to it being night. Pay attention to the highway information sign in case a navigational change is required soon. Use headlights and possibly high beams if there is no oncoming traffic to enhance visibility. Be alert for potential merging vehicles due to the nearby exit indicated by the traffic sign. Keep within lane markings to avoid the concrete barriers and to stay on the correct route. Continuous observation and readiness to adjust speed based on the behavior of the truck and other users are recommended."
