        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a car on the left side of the image, positioned perpendicular to our vehicle's direction of travel and situated on the adjacent lane. The car's active status is indicated by its illuminated headlights. The presence of this vehicle is significant as it may enter the intersection, potentially influencing the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, another small vehicle is visible in the distance, directly ahead. Although it is far enough away to not immediately affect our vehicle's driving route, its movements should still be monitored due to the possibility of future impact.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene show several signals, but the one relevant to our vehicle's direction is red. This red light mandates that the vehicle must stop at the intersection and wait for the signal to change to green before continuing.\n\nOn the right side of the road, reflective traffic cones with orange and white stripes are present, signaling that part of the road may be closed or hazardous. These cones suggest that the autonomous vehicle must navigate within the confines of the open lane and may be restricted from turning right, depending on the road closure details.\n\nFurthermore, a series of traffic cones are arranged across the pedestrian crosswalk at the intersection. This arrangement implies that there could be road construction or closed areas, which would affect the available space for passage and require the vehicle to maintain its lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should stop at the intersection upon seeing a red light. While stopping, you should monitor the vehicles on the left to anticipate if they will enter the intersection and pay attention to the vehicles in the distance ahead and any motorcycles that may be queuing up. In addition, your vehicle needs to be aware of any traffic cones on the right and in the areas designated for pedestrian crossings, as these may affect its ability to turn or pass through the intersection. Aside from stopping at the red light, there is no need for immediate further action. However, once the traffic lights change, situational awareness is crucial for the next move.",
