The parked vehicles narrow the available road space for the ego car and could potentially hide pedestrians or other vehicles as they pull out of their parking spots. Additionally, there is a traffic light visible in the upper right corner of the scene. However, the state of the traffic light cannot be determined from the image, which is crucial since its indication could command the ego car to either proceed, stop, or exercise caution, depending on whether the light is green, red, or yellow respectively. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that affect driving behavior."
