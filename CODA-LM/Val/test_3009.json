Additionally, the driver must prepare to merge left, as traffic cones and roadblocks indicate a lane closure. The self-driving car should ensure the use of appropriate headlights to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers but be prepared to respond to any sudden changes from oncoming traffic. Considering the potential for slippery road conditions, speed should be appropriately reduced, and a greater following distance maintained. Drivers should be vigilant for possible changes in road layout or obstacles indicated by red barriers and watch for any objects that might enter the road from near trash bins.",
