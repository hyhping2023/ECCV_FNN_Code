        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario described in the data, there are a number of notable observations specifically related to different categories of road users. Firstly, parked cars are seen on both sides of the road, primarily white but also in various other colors. These vehicles are stationary and aligned parallel to the road, situated in the rightmost lanes adjacent to the sidewalks. This placement of parked cars limits the usable width of the road for the ego car (self-driving car). Drivers must, therefore, remain vigilant as the sudden opening of car doors or the unexpected appearance of a pedestrian from between these vehicles could occur.\n\nFurthermore, a pedestrian is detected on the right sidewalk, moving in a direction parallel to the road. While the pedestrian is currently not affecting the driving behavior since they are on the sidewalk, it is crucial for the ego car to stay alert should the pedestrian decide to cross the street.\n\nIn terms of traffic management devices, a traffic light is positioned ahead which displays a green signal, permitting movement straight or to turn left. This green light provides the ego car with the right of way, but still requires cautious driving to account for any unpredictable actions from other road users.\n\nAdditionally, a row of orange traffic cones is present on the right side of the road, delineating a specific section potentially due to construction or a road hazard. This configuration hints at a possible lane narrowing or an obstruction on the road, necessitating reduced speed by the ego car and preparedness to merge left if required.\n\nTemporary barriers are also observed beyond the traffic cones, also on the right side of the road. These barriers likely indicate an area under construction and thus inaccessible to vehicles. They signify the importance for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and continue navigating within the usable portions of the road. \n\nThe data did not mention any relevant details under the categories of traffic signs and other objects as these were empty in the description, indicating their absence or irrelevance in the current traffic image."

Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles on both sides, monitor for any doors opening or pedestrians that may enter the road. If the road narrows due to the cones or construction, be prepared to merge to the left if necessary while considering other vehicles around the ego car. Maintain a moderate speed while passing the parked cars, watch for any unpredicted actions from pedestrians, and be prepared to stop if necessary. Observe the traffic lights and prepare to adjust speed according to the change in signal. Stay within the marked lanes and be cautious of the delineated area indicated by traffic cones, reducing speed if necessary. Keep an appropriate distance from other vehicles to allow for safe stopping distances."
