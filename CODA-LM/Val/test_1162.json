                "description": "A large, beige-colored truck with visible contact details, a weight indication of 31000kg, and a width of 900 mm, is positioned on the right side of the frame, partially visible, suggesting close proximity to the ego vehicle. The truck has Chinese characters on its side, indicating a possible non-English speaking region or imported vehicle. The specifics of its load and its state (moving or stationary) cannot be determined from the current angle. Visible elements imply it is a heavy vehicle, which may affect traffic flow due to its size and maneuvering characteristics.",
                "explanation": "Given the size and proximity of the truck, it could pose a potential hazard, especially if it is moving or if there is a need to maneuver around it. The truck would likely require additional space for lane changes and turns, and would have longer stopping distances. If it's moving, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance. If it's stationary, the ego car might need to change lanes to pass. As the truck occupies a significant portion of the frame, it is likely that it is either moving slowly or is stationary. The ego car must be cautious and possibly prepare to either stop or maneuver around the truck."

It is positioned on the right side of the frame and is partially visible, which suggests it is in close proximity to the ego vehicle. The truck displays Chinese characters on its side, hinting that the scene might be in a non-English speaking region or that the vehicle is imported. The load of the truck and whether it is moving or stationary cannot be determined from the current angle. However, the visible elements suggest it is a heavy vehicle, which could impact the flow of traffic due to its size and the way it needs to be maneuvered.\n\nThe presence of the truck could pose a potential hazard. If the truck is moving, the ego car should keep a safe following distance due to the truck's longer stopping distances and the additional space it requires for lane changes and turns. If the truck is stationary, the ego car might need to change lanes to pass it. Since the truck occupies a significant portion of the frame, it is likely that it is either moving slowly or is stationary. Therefore, the ego car must be cautious and possibly prepare to either stop or maneuver around the truck.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

This mirror is crucial for safe driving, as it helps in detecting vehicles that may be in the driver's blind spot, thus aiding in changing lanes or making turns safely.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the close proximity to the large truck, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance to avoid any blind spots and be prepared for any unexpected movements from the truck. If the truck is stationary, the ego vehicle may need to carefully pass if there is another lane available and it is safe to do so. If the truck is moving, the ego vehicle should adjust its speed to ensure a safe following distance. The ego car should keep a safe distance from the truck, be prepared to adjust speed, and change lanes if necessary while considering the size and maneuverability of the truck. Without further context from the traffic scene, no additional specific maneuvers can be recommended. Assess the truck's movement-if the truck is stationary, prepare to stop or pass it safely; if it is moving, adjust the ego car's speed accordingly. Stay vigilant for other road users that may be obscured by the truck's size."
