Only after confirming safety, you are allowed to proceed. Be aware of potential unexpected movements around parked bicycles, and watch out for any cyclists or pedestrians that might appear. Be vigilant of possible road work or obstacles indicated by traffic cones ahead. Exercise caution due to the potential unpredictable behavior of dogs. Stay alert for pedestrians or cyclists who may enter the roadway from the sidewalk area where bicycles are parked. Keep a safe distance from traffic cones and avoid the restricted areas they may indicate. Watch for dogs by the roadside in case they suddenly run onto the road. Observe any further road signs or changes in road conditions. Maintain your lane and stay away from areas marked by traffic cones. Be mindful of cyclists that may enter the road at bicycle parking spots.",
