This van's position may influence the drivable area, requiring the ego car to navigate around it if the lane is obstructed.\n  - A yellow taxi is visible in the distance on the right, with its rear towards the ego car, indicating it may be moving away. Although the taxi does not currently affect the driving behavior, it should be monitored in case it stops or changes direction.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A pedestrian is on the left sidewalk, and a child in a yellow jacket appears to be crossing the road ahead of the ego car. The child crossing the road is critical for the ego car to slow down or stop to ensure their safety.\n  - A cyclist is in the middle of the road, moving away from the ego vehicle. The presence of the cyclist necessitates maintaining a safe distance and overtaking with caution if the road allows.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Red and white striped traffic barricades line the left side of the roadway. These guide traffic flow and suggest a construction zone or closed lane, urging the ego car to steer clear of the area.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - A series of barriers and barricades are set up on the left, some of which are striped red and white, indicating a demarcated zone. These barriers indicate an area to avoid, likely due to construction or road work, and require the ego car to maintain a safe distance.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - Street debris is visible near the bottom right corner of the image on the road. This could potentially be a hazard if the debris impedes the driving path or becomes a projectile."

It should navigate cautiously around the parked van, avoid the barricaded area to the left, and maintain a watchful eye on the pedestrians near the road. Anticipating potential movements from other vehicles and being ready to stop or adjust the course is recommended. Be prepared to stop for pedestrians waiting to cross the road, and maintain a safe following distance from the cyclist ahead. Monitor the taxi to anticipate any potential lane changes or stops. Keep a close watch on any hidden zones created by the parked van and obstacles, ensuring that there are no road users or unexpected movements that would require immediate action from the ego vehicle."
