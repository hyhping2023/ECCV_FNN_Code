Passenger cars are observed in both adjacent lanes traveling in the same direction, possibly restricting the ego car's ability to switch lanes. Upcoming construction is indicated by several signs on the right, signaling possible road work that could lead to changes in traffic patterns or lane usage. A traffic light located further ahead displays a red signal, necessitating that all vehicles come to a halt. Orange traffic cones create a visible line marking the boundary between the active lanes and the construction site on the right, steering traffic away from the construction area. Metal barriers also line the right side of the road, safeguarding pedestrians by keeping vehicles off the sidewalk."

Additionally, with a red traffic light ahead, the ego car should be ready to come to a full stop at the traffic signal. Lane changes may be risky due to the traffic on both sides, and the driver should be vigilant for any shifts in traffic flow or construction-related obstacles. The presence of metal barriers signifies that the footpath is out of bounds for driving maneuvers. Overall, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, adhering to the road conditions and observing traffic laws."
