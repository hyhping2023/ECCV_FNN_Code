Firstly, there is a white sedan on the left-hand side of the ego car, which is stationary with its brake lights on. This vehicle is waiting for the red traffic light ahead, and its position next to the ego car means it is a controlling factor in the traffic flow, requiring the ego car to also wait.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there are several vehicles in various lanes. They are either stationary or moving slowly, with their brake lights and headlights on, indicating a busy intersection. These vehicles will dictate when it is safe for the ego car to proceed and at what speed, as they are directly influencing the movement across the intersection.\n\nA pedestrian is also present, crossing the street from right to left, slightly ahead of the ego car's path. The pedestrian's presence in the crosswalk is critical, as the ego car is required to yield and cannot proceed until the pedestrian has safely crossed.\n\nThere are various illuminated business signs on the roadside, but these are not directly related to driving decisions. While they do not impact the driving behavior, they could potentially distract the driver.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image are showing red for vehicles and green for pedestrians. This means the ego car must remain stationary due to the red light, while the green light for pedestrians indicates that it is their turn to cross.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
