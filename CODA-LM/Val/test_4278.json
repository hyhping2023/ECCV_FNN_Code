As long as the vehicle remains stationary, it does not pose a direct threat to the current lane; however, vigilance is required if it joins the traffic flow.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a series of red and white traffic cones are lined up, indicating that the lane ahead is either closed or undergoing construction. These cones signal that the lane they are in is not available for driving, suggesting the presence of road construction or an obstruction.\n\nNext to the traffic cones on the left, there is a yellow barrier with reflective stripes which further emphasizes the lane closure or unsuitability for driving. This barrier highlights the importance of avoiding restricted lanes and staying alert for any personnel or machinery that might be present at the construction site.\n\nAdditionally, leaves and trees line the right side of the road, followed by residential or office buildings. Although these objects do not directly affect the driving path, they contribute to the environment and may obscure pedestrians or other hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "When passing through a section with traffic cones, the vehicle should stay in its lane and slow down if necessary. Drivers must be vigilant for any workers or machinery that may unexpectedly enter the driving lane. Since there are no other visible road users or signals indicating the need to stop or yield, the vehicle may cautiously proceed. Maintain the legal speed limit and stay in the right-hand lane, be aware of any white vehicles parked on the side of the road, and be prepared for changes in traffic patterns that may be caused by construction indicated by traffic cones and barriers. Unless traffic conditions or road signs indicate otherwise, there is no need to change the travel route.",

The presence of the traffic cone on the road suggests that there may be roadwork, an obstruction, or some temporary traffic condition ahead that requires the driver of the ego car to proceed with caution and possibly change lanes or alter their course to avoid the coned-off area.",
