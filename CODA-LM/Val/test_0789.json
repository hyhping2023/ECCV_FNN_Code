        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are various elements that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Starting with the vehicles, a silver sedan is positioned just ahead and to the right, partially in the same lane as the self-driving car. This sedan could pose an obstacle due to possible parallel parking or lane merging activity. Further, multiple cars are halted along both sides of the road, which narrows the usable lane width and has the potential to obscure pedestrians that may step out from between them. Additionally, there's an oncoming vehicle traveling in the opposite direction, necessitating that the self-driving vehicle keeps to its lane and maintains a safe distance from the centerline.\n\nA vulnerable road user, such as a cyclist, is stationary behind an obstacle on the road's right edge, partially blocked from the vehicle's direct view. This situation requires careful attention since the cyclist might unexpectedly enter the driving lane, presenting a possible danger.\n\nLastly, the presence of concrete or metal barriers installed close to the driving lane on the road's right side suggests construction activity or a cordoned-off area, which means the autonomous vehicle should proceed with caution and at a slower speed due to the reduced road width.\n\nThe scene does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that need to be taken into account."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, being ready to stop or give way to bicycles that may enter the road, carefully navigate around obstacles considering the limited road width, and adjust speed to suit potential slippery road conditions. Additionally, your vehicle should monitor parked vehicles to prevent unexpected movements from cyclists or pedestrians, and due to the slippery road conditions, increase the distance from other vehicles to accommodate longer braking distances. It is advised to remain vigilant, paying attention to any movements by people next to vehicles parked on the right side of the road. Your vehicle must also continue to monitor oncoming traffic and maintain a safe distance from the center line.",
