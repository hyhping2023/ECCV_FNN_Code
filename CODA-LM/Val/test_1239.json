This vehicle poses a potential hazard as it occupies part of the road and its crane arm extends into the driving lane, potentially affecting the navigable width for the ego car and other traffic.\n\nAdditionally, in the distance, there are several directional signs mounted on overhead gantries. These signs are crucial as they convey important information about lane usage and directions that should inform the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nFurthermore, traffic cones are arranged in a line diagonally across the road, leading vehicles to deviate to the left. The cones signify a temporary adjustment in the road layout, which is probably due to construction activity and serves to guide the traffic to follow the modified driving path.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are listed in the data, indicating that these elements are not present in the current traffic scenario."

It is crucial to maintain a safe distance from the truck and to be prepared for potential movements from it if it is in operation."
