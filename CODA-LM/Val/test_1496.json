However, there are other objects of interest. Specifically, the scene includes spools of cable and other industrial materials located on the side of the road. This setting suggests the area might be undergoing construction or is an industrial zone. Additionally, two individuals are seen interacting with or inspecting one of the spools. Although these individuals are not directly on the roadway, their close proximity to it requires that drivers exercise caution. This is particularly important for the ego vehicle, as it navigates through areas with potential construction or industrial activity. The presence of these individuals and materials near the road could pose hazards, necessitating a cautious approach in case they or other related obstacles unexpectedly enter the roadway."

This object is not a typical element of the roadway, but rather appears to be a form of industrial equipment or heavy machinery component stored at the roadside. For the ego car, this object should not affect driving behavior unless it encroaches onto the road. It is essential to ensure that the car's path is not obstructed by unexpected items from the roadside.",
