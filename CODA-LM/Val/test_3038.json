        "description and explanation": "On the road ahead, there is a yellow construction vehicle situated in the right lane and partially extending into our vehicle's left lane. It is important to be vigilant around this vehicle since it is operational and could move unexpectedly, requiring our vehicle to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a line of several vehicles has formed in the lane to our left, which includes our vehicle. The presence of the construction vehicle may have contributed to these vehicles moving slowly or coming to a stop, necessitating that our autonomous vehicle adjusts its speed and keeps an adequate gap.\n\nParallel to the road and on the right sidewalk, there are cyclists and potential pedestrians queued up. Although they are not directly on the road, it's essential for the self-driving system to monitor them in case any should inadvertently enter our driving lane.\n\nVisible on the right side of the road is a barrier that demarcates the traffic lanes and is marked with reflective stripes, which serve to illustrate the direction of traffic flow. These barriers ensure that vehicles, including ours, remain in the proper lane and do not drift into oncoming traffic on the other side of the median.\n\nLastly, a bicycle can be observed propped against a railing on the sidewalk's right side. The self-driving vehicle's system should remain cautious around this static object as there is a potential risk if someone attempts to retrieve the bicycle and inadvertently steps into the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the presence of construction vehicles, traffic cones, other vehicles, cyclists, and road conditions, self-driving vehicles should slow down to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, stay alert to potential changes in traffic flow caused by the work zone, watch out for cyclists who may enter the road, and be prepared to stop immediately if traffic ahead comes to a halt. Additionally, if vehicles in other lanes merge due to roadblocks, self-driving vehicles should be ready to maneuver quickly.",
