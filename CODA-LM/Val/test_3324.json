        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements affecting the driving environment. On the right side of the road, construction vehicles are partially on the road and partially on the sidewalk, with their warning lights visible. These vehicles suggest that there is construction work ahead, which may occupy part of the roadway and create an obstruction. As a result, the ego car must maneuver cautiously to avoid this potential hazard.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users visible in the image, which means no immediate action is required in this regard, there are other factors to consider. Overhead directional signs are indicating lane directions, which are important for making lane choice decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights at the intersection ahead show a green light, indicating that the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed, provided the path is clear of any obstructions.\n\nMultiple traffic cones are placed on the road, marking the boundaries of the construction area. These cones serve to guide traffic away from potential hazards and signal a reduction in the available roadway width, necessitating careful navigation by the ego car.\n\nYellow barriers are also present on the right side of the road, providing a visual indication of road works. These barriers guide the ego car to move left, away from the potential hazards associated with the construction site.\n\nLastly, construction equipment is observed on the right side beyond the barriers. This equipment increases the need for vigilance as it indicates active work, which might lead to unexpected obstacles or workers being close to the driving lane. The ego car must therefore remain alert to these additional potential hazards while driving through the area."

Adjust driving speed to account for wet road conditions, ensuring safe stopping distances and reduced risk of skidding. Be prepared to adjust lane position away from the right side where the construction vehicle, cones, and barriers are present. Maintain a lower speed to account for reduced traction and potential for sudden stops or debris. Since there are no vulnerable road users visible, proceed when safe, adhering to overhead directional signs for lane usage."
