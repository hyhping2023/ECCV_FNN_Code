Its large size and slow speed may cause the ego car to slow down or change lanes to overtake. Additionally, a black sedan is positioned to the left of the ego vehicle, in an adjacent lane, facing the same direction. The presence of this sedan affects the ego car's ability to change lanes to the left if necessary.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, behind a metal barrier, pedestrians are visible. Even though they are not on the road, their proximity to the street means the ego car should monitor them in case they enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAhead and to the right of the ego vehicle, a traffic light displays a red signal, indicating that the ego car must stop and wait for the light to change to green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, metal barriers run alongside to the right of the ego vehicle, separating the sidewalk from the road. These barriers define the boundary of the driving area and pedestrian space, guiding the ego car to stay within its lane."
