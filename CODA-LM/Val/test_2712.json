This helps drivers anticipate the road layout beyond what is visible, especially useful at night.\n   - A yellow rectangular sign on the right side of the road is positioned horizontally and likely indicates directions or instructions for road users. This sign can convey critical information about detours, construction, or road closures, potentially impacting the ego car's intended route.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - There are traffic lights with green lights visible overhead in the distance, signaling that the ego car has the right of way to proceed. The green light allows the ego car to continue forward if the path is clear and safe.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Multiple traffic cones are placed in a way that narrows the driving lane, visible on both sides and stretching into the distance. These cones guide traffic flow and indicate areas where driving may be restricted due to road work or other temporary conditions.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - A yellow road work sign is visible on the right side of the road slightly ahead, illuminated by headlights. This sign indicates upcoming roadworks, suggesting the driver needs to be cautious and prepared for possible obstacles or work crews.\n\nNo vehicles, vulnerable road users, or barriers are observed in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is generally made of plastic or rubber. It is bright and reflective for high visibility at night. Traffic cones are used to mark areas for various traffic scenarios such as road construction sites or areas where part of the road is no longer safe to drive on. In this scenario, the presence of the cone will require the driver to reduce speed and maneuver carefully around it to avoid any potential hazards and adhere to the change in traffic flow suggested by the placement of the cones.",

This could indicate roadwork ahead, a closed lane, or could be directing vehicles to alter their course to avoid an obstacle. The positioning of this traffic cone requires that the driver of the ego car should remain vigilant and prepared to change lanes or adjust the vehicle's positioning on the road to maintain a safe driving path.",

Maintain a vigilant watch on the road for any sudden changes due to road workers or machinery and be ready to adapt to dynamic conditions. Use headlights appropriately for night-time visibility and follow the cones' guided path to navigate through the work zone safely. Additionally, attention should be paid to any instructions provided on the yellow sign, in case it affects the intended route."
