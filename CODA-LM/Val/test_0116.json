These cones require the ego car to stay in the current lane or merge left if necessary. Additionally, a series of orange traffic cones extends from the mid-right of the image towards the horizon down the right lane, further indicating the need for a merge to the left due to a lane closure ahead.\n\nThough no traffic lights are visible in this image, the absence of traffic lights suggests that the ego car should follow standard right-of-way rules and remain attentive to any uncontrolled intersections ahead.\n\nLastly, there is a large red and white barrier on the right side of the road, past the traffic cones. This barrier likely signifies more permanent or long-term road changes, reinforcing the lane closure indicated by the cones."
