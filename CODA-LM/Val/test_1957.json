The placement of these cones may indicate a work zone ahead, suggesting that the right portion of the road under the overpass might be restricted or closed to traffic.\n\nFurthermore, metal barriers are partially visible surrounding the construction area. These barriers indicate restricted access and serve to separate the construction zone from the operational roadway, clearly signaling that vehicles should not enter the construction area."
