This vehicle has an arm or apparatus extended upwards and is flashing red lights, indicating it is either in operation or work mode. Due to its size, position on the road, and flashing lights, the vehicle might be moving slowly or be stationary, potentially impeding normal traffic flow and requiring the ego vehicle to slow down or stop. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or objects are present in this image."

This vehicle is utilized for tasks like excavation, heavy lifting, and transporting construction materials. For the ego vehicle, encountering this construction vehicle means increased caution is necessary. The ego vehicle may need to slow down, maintain a safe following distance, or potentially change lanes to avoid close proximity, considering that construction vehicles may make sudden turns or stops related to construction activities.",

The driver should monitor the situation and follow any directions given by construction personnel or additional traffic signs or signals that may be present but not visible in the image. Additionally, the ego vehicle should be prepared to yield to any oncoming traffic that may be passing the construction vehicle if the road is narrowed down to a single lane. It's also advisable to be prepared for any sudden movements by the work vehicle and to look for a safe opportunity to change lanes if necessary."
