Specifically, there are traffic cones, alternating in red and white, lined up on the right side of the lane, likely indicating a construction zone or lane closure. This necessitates that the vehicle adjusts its position to navigate around the cones, ensuring a safe distance to react to potential obstacles in the open lane. Additionally, there are concrete barriers on the right side, which separate the active lane from the restricted area, thereby compelling the vehicle to stay within the designated lanes and maintain a safe distance, guiding traffic safely through the restricted zone."

Continue to pay attention to changes in traffic lights, and stay within the marked lanes considering the reduced lane width.

They often signify temporary traffic control zones and guide vehicles to stay away from certain areas due to road work, a traffic accident, or other hazards. The presence of these cones would require the ego car to adjust its path to avoid the indicated area, either by changing lanes or reducing speed in preparation for potential obstructions or to adhere to revised traffic patterns.",
