Above the intersection, there are directional signs which advise on lane usage, an important detail given that the lanes may be impeded by the turning truck. At the present moment, the traffic light facing the ego car is red, indicating that the car should come to a halt and wait for the signal to turn green to continue. Additionally, there are traffic cones situated on the right edge of the intersection, signifying a possible hazard or road work ahead, which warrants the ego car to stay at a safe distance and potentially adjust its trajectory slightly to the left when navigating past them. Alongside the road edge, orange and white traffic posts are also installed, serving as a lane separator or a boundary marker that vehicles should not cross. No vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, are present in this scenario, and there are no other objects to take into account."

While stopped, the ego car should monitor surrounding traffic and prepare for its next actions according to the traffic light signals and lane directions indicated by the signs. The ego car should not attempt to overtake the truck or change lanes due to the limited space caused by the barriers and the truck's turning maneuver. Additionally, the driver should be attentive to the traffic cones marking the road's edge and avoid passing them too closely."
