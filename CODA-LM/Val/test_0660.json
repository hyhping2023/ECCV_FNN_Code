Next, there are several stopped automobiles of various colors on the road ahead due to the traffic light, which could resume motion as soon as the light changes. Additionally, a white car is visible on the right side parallel to the bus, partially within view, necessitating vigilance regarding its actions which can impact the ego car's navigation.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is a group of pedestrians, including someone with a stroller, crossing in front of the ego vehicle, to whom the right of way must be given. A man with a dog is also crossing the road near the median, introducing unpredictability to the road users' movement patterns that the ego car must consider. Moreover, an individual with a cart is poised to cross the road on the right, presenting a potential crossing hazard.\n\nIn terms of signage, there are no traffic signs directly affecting the immediate maneuvers of the ego car; thus, normal traffic regulations such as stopping for red lights and yielding to pedestrians are observed. The traffic lights for the lane of the ego car are red, necessitating a full stop until the signal changes to green.\n\nLastly, the presence of a small plastic bag on the road in front of the bus, to the left of the ego car, serves as a reminder that even seemingly minor debris can be unpredictable and needs to be monitored to prevent it from becoming a danger to vehicles or pedestrians.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or additional objects present that would otherwise affect the driving decisions of the ego vehicle in this scenario."
