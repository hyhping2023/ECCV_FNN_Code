Despite the dimly lit surroundings, the vehicles are visible as silhouettes, and their stillness is indicated by the reflective surfaces. These parked vehicles present a potential risk as they narrow the available driving space and may hide pedestrians or other hazards. \n\nFurthermore, the scene includes streetlights and the lighting from buildings on the right side of the road. While such illumination generally enhances visibility for road users, it may occasionally result in reflections or glare, which could interfere with a driverâ€™s line of sight and overall visibility. \n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in the image, indicating there are no such elements to report in this particular scene."
