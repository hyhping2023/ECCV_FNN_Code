It is positioned outside of the traffic lane but is partially obstructing the sidewalk. While the forklift is not currently affecting vehicle traffic, it could become a potential hazard if it were to move unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are two red traffic lights in the scene. One is for the straight lane and the other for the left turn lane. These red lights require vehicles to stop at the intersection and wait for the lights to turn green before proceeding.\n\nFurthermore, a barrier has been set up on the right side of the road, effectively separating the construction zone and sidewalk from the vehicular traffic lane. This barrier serves as a clear indication that vehicles are not allowed to enter the construction zone and must remain on the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light, our vehicle should come to a complete stop at the intersection. While stopping, the driver should pay attention to changes in the traffic lights and be watchful of forklifts to prevent them from entering the roadway. Care should be taken near construction zones protected by fencing to ensure that no pedestrians attempt to cross the road. Our vehicle should only proceed after the traffic light turns green. During the wait, the driver should observe any environmental changes on the right side where the forklifts and construction barriers are located, such as movements of forklifts or construction personnel, which may require extra caution after the light turns green. The driver should also be prepared for potential lane closures or detours indicated by barriers.",

It is on the road and appears to be moving or preparing to move, which indicates that there may be construction activity in the area. The presence of this vehicle necessitates caution from the ego car driver. The driver should slow down, maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for unexpected movements from the construction vehicle, and be aware of potential directions that the vehicle could turn or move. Additionally, the driver should be attentive to any construction signs or workers that might be directing traffic or indicating closed lanes.",
