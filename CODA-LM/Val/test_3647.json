Multiple traffic signs are present; construction warning signs ahead suggest possible road work or altered traffic flow, a sign indicating a left turn at the upcoming intersection, and a yellow sign warning of construction or road works ahead, prompting drivers to be cautious of potential hazards or changes in road conditions.\n\nRed plastic barriers, metal fences, and a temporary barrier in the middle of the road are set to guide vehicles through the construction area and control access, delineating where vehicles can go and indicating that they must navigate around them safely.\n\nFinally, there is a tree on the right-hand side of the view, but it does not obstruct the road or influence our driving path, merely adding to the environment's context. Traffic lights and traffic cones are not present in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the construction area, please drive carefully, adjust your speed accordingly, and pay close attention to any sudden movements of stationary vehicles and construction workers. If a worker enters the road or needs to navigate around obstacles such as construction fences, be prepared to stop or give way. Keep a safe distance from parked vehicles and remain alert for signs that these vehicles might join the traffic flow. Approach checkpoints slowly, be ready to stop behind the white line, and wait for the fence to open before continuing. While waiting, the driver should watch for any signals or directions from checkpoint personnel, or any additional signs that may provide further instructions on how to pass through the checkpoint. Drivers should also observe lane markings and follow designated lanes according to the intended direction. Due to lane closures or detours indicated by traffic cones and barriers, slow down and be prepared to change lanes if necessary. If workers near the road enter the driving lane, maintain a cautious speed. Continue to monitor any changes in the behavior of stationary vehicles and moving vehicles in the distance, as these changes may affect the driving scenario.",
