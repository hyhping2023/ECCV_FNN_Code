Firstly, there is a white van on the right side of the road, partially in the lane of the ego car. It is stopped with its hazard lights activated, which may lead to a potential obstacle for the ego car, necessitating a lane change or speed adjustment to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a truck ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. While the truck does not directly impede the path of the ego car, it should be monitored in case it changes lanes or slows down unexpectedly.\n\nFurthermore, a series of traffic cones are placed on the right side of the ego car's lane, indicating a lane closure or road work ahead. These cones are narrowing the drivable road space and signaling to merge left, thereby compelling the ego car to change lanes to the left to avoid them. Complementing the traffic cones, there is a green metal barrier along the right side of the road, contributing to the narrowing of the road. This barrier is a static object that, together with the traffic cones, confirms that a section of the road is not accessible, and further emphasizes the need for the ego car to stay in the left lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."
