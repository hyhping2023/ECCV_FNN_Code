A set of traffic lights ahead has turned red, requiring the vehicle to stop and wait for the signal to change before proceeding. On the right side of the road, large portable yellow barriers have been placed, necessitating that the self-driving vehicle follow an adjusted traffic flow which may involve merging into the left lane and being cautious of any oncoming traffic also navigating around the barrier.\n\nAdditionally, there are streetlights and vegetation by the roadside. While these do not directly impact driving behavior, they require the vehicle to maintain lane discipline. Moreover, a large yellow trash can is situated on the side of the road, occupying part of the bike lane. This could force cyclists to merge into the driving lane, prompting the vehicle to be vigilant for vulnerable road users who may inadvertently enter its path."

Prepare to merge left, heeding warning signs and obstacles, to accommodate potential lane closures or detours. Stay alert when nearing obstacles, mindful of any additional changes in traffic patterns and the responses of other road users. Upon encountering a red light, the vehicle must come to a complete stop at the designated point and wait until the green light to proceed. Exercise caution when passing obstacles and trash bins on the right, watching for any potential hazards or road users that may affect the drivable path.",
