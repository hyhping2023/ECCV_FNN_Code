One is at a distance, on the far left lane across the intersection, with its headlights visible, indicating the need for a safe following distance. The second vehicle is a black or dark-colored hatchback or compact car moving dynamically from left to right through the intersection, which requires our vehicle to yield to the cross traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians on the crosswalk to the right of our vehicle who appear to be waiting for the signal to change. This suggests that drivers must be prepared to stop if the pedestrian signal light changes to allow them to cross.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene include a red light straight ahead, which means that vehicles must remain stopped until it turns green.\n\nFurthermore, traffic cones are placed on the edges of the crosswalk on both sides of the road. These cones indicate a designated pedestrian route and may also serve as obstacles for vehicles, suggesting possible road construction or obstacles at the pedestrian crosswalk that could affect the movement of both pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light, the self-driving car should come to a complete stop. At the same time, it should monitor the dark-colored sedan across the intersection in case it shows signs of movement when the light changes. Once the traffic signal is given to them, the self-driving car should be ready to yield to pedestrians on the right side. It should also watch out for other vehicles that may cross the intersection perpendicularly, such as a black hatchback, to ensure safe travel after the traffic light turns green. Given the current situation, the self-driving car should slow down and stop due to the red light ahead. The driver should remain vigilant, watch for pedestrians on the right, keep an eye on the black sedan ahead, and be ready to give way to pedestrians who may cross the street upon receiving the walk signal. Furthermore, the driver should observe any changes in traffic signals and be prepared to proceed when the light turns green, always taking into account potential traffic cones, which could indicate a work area or hazard.",
