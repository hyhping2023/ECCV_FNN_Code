        "description and explanation": "In the image observed, there is a white SUV parked on the right-hand side of the road, facing the ego car, with another white car parked further ahead of the SUV. These vehicles limit the road's usable width and could obscure the view of pedestrians or other potential hazards emerging from the right, necessitating careful navigation by the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian walking on the road, moving away from the ego vehicle towards the right side. Additionally, a dog is sitting by the bushes near the parked white SUV on the right side of the road. The pedestrian and the dog present potential risks; the pedestrian's presence on the road requires vigilance and possibly immediate action. The dog could unpredictably enter the road and the autonomous vehicle must be ready to decelerate or halt to ensure safety.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a traffic sign with a red and white no-entry symbol, indicating that entering the lane in the direction of the arrow is prohibited for vehicles. This traffic sign indicates where the ego car cannot travel, assisting in the decision-making process for route planning.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this image. The autonomous vehicle must account for the aforementioned parked vehicles, pedestrian, dog, and the traffic sign restricting entry to a part of the road during its operation."

Furthermore, it should be ready to stop if the pedestrian or the dog enters the driving path. As there are parked cars on the side of the road potentially limiting visibility and road space, the ego car should also ensure that it is traveling at a safe speed that allows for adequate reaction time. It is also important to note the no-entry sign, ensuring that the ego car does not make an illegal turn to the left."
