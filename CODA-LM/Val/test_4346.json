The presence of this traffic cone in the driving scenario indicates to the driver of the ego car that caution may be necessary, and potentially signals that there is construction, an accident, lane narrowing, or some other temporary change in normal driving conditions. The ego car will need to navigate around the cone, ensuring not to collide with it, and be aware of the potential need to maneuver differently than under normal driving conditions.",

It should slow down, if necessary, to safely navigate around the traffic cones, constantly monitoring the surroundings for any unexpected movements from the stationary vehicle, potential pedestrians, or changes in the road conditions. The driver should be particularly vigilant for any movement from the parked SUV to the right and be prepared to slow down or stop if pedestrians or other obstacles appear suddenly from behind the stationary vehicles or construction barriers. No immediate action is required regarding the mirror, dustbins, or the booth, but situational awareness should be maintained. Stay vigilant for the person in the guard booth in case they step onto the roadway. Drive at a reduced speed if road conditions or visibility are poor."
