Ahead of this parked car, in the same lane, there is another vehicle with its headlights on, which could be stationary or moving in the same direction. The presence of parked vehicles requires vigilance as they may suddenly open doors or start moving. Additionally, the vehicle ahead could slow down or stop, necessitating readiness to respond from the driver.\n\nOn the right side of the road, traffic cones are placed, suggesting that the area is blocked or restricted. These cones signal that the vehicle should maintain its current lane and avoid moving into the restricted area.\n\nNear the traffic cones, there is an object that looks like a trash can on the right side of the road. Such stationary objects could become hazards if they were to enter the roadway, so careful driving is advised in this vicinity.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image."
