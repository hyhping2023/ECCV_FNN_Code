The ego car should monitor its speed and anticipate potential stops or slow-downs to prevent rear-end collisions.\n3. **Black Car:** Located on the right side, traveling slightly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same direction. Its position and speed will influence the ego car's decision to change lanes or adjust speed to maintain a safe distance.\n4. **Heavy Machinery Convoy:** Directly ahead in the distance, occupying the center of the road and moving in the same direction. The cargo's overhang and the vehicle's slower speed require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and prepare for possible stops or slow traffic.\n5. **Green Tanker Truck:** Observed on the far right, moving in the same direction but at a distance from the ego vehicle. This truck's position is noteworthy but does not immediately affect the ego car's driving decisions unless a lane change to the right is anticipated.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n- **Green Signal:** Just visible to the left of the bus and truck convoy.

Since the red truck is partially in the lane of the ego vehicle, a slight adjustment in lane position to the right may be necessary, taking care not to get too close to the black car on the right. The green light at the intersection permits travel, but caution and readiness to respond to the actions of other road users are paramount for safety. Maintain a safe distance from the bus ahead, monitor the large vehicles beside the ego car for any change in speed or lane position, be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Keep an eye out for the traffic light signal to ensure compliance with traffic laws. Continue to observe for any changes in the road conditions that could necessitate an adjustment in driving behavior."
