This white car influences the autonomous vehicle by determining the appropriate driving speed and the need for maintaining a safe following distance. \n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones placed to the left side of the ego vehicle's lane. These cones demarcate an area that is possibly under construction or a closed-off section of the road, signaling that the ego car should remain in the lane and not cross into the coned-off area.\n\nConcrete barriers are also present to the left of the ego vehicle. These are likely in place to indicate a lane split or to safeguard a work zone. The barriers serve to direct the traffic flow, guiding the ego vehicle along the correct path and ensuring that it stays a safe distance away from any potential hazards in the construction zone.\n\nThe summary does not mention any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects, as there are none mentioned in the provided JSON data for this particular traffic image."
