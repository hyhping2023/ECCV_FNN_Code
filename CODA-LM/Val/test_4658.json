        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable road user categories including vehicles and traffic lights. \n\nStarting with the vehicles, there is a tow truck identified ahead on the road. This tow truck is noticeable by its yellow flashing light and distinct signage indicating it is currently in service. It occupies the rightmost lane and is faced in such a manner that its rear is directed towards the ego car. The primary concern with this tow truck is its potential to slow down or completely stop to perform a service. This activity could disrupt the normal flow of traffic, necessitating caution from the ego car and other road users.\n\nAs we move to the traffic lights category, there is a traffic signal within sight, exhibiting a green light for the direction in which the ego car is traveling. This green light grants the right of way to the ego car, allowing it to proceed through the intersection. However, it is crucial to do so with caution, ensuring it is safe before moving forward.\n\nIn this scene, there are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists, nor are there any traffic sign indications, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects that could influence the driving behavior of the ego car or pose additional considerations."

The ego vehicle should continue to observe the traffic light and be prepared to slow down or stop in case the light changes to yellow or red. Pay attention to surrounding traffic and be ready to respond to the actions of the tow truck, which may influence the behavior of other drivers on the road."
