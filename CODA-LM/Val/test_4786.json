One group of pedestrians is crossing the road directly in the path of the ego car; the group consists of a person walking, another on a bicycle, and someone pushing an individual in a wheelchair. Since they are in the crosswalk and have the right of way, the ego car is required to yield to them. Another group is observed on the sidewalk to the left, approaching the crosswalk. As they appear to be intending to cross soon, the ego car must also be prepared to yield to them should they enter the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic signs present in the scene are directional road signs above the intersection and a no-horn sign to the right of the intersection. The directional signs provide information on routes to various destinations but are not directly influencing the ego car's immediate driving behavior. In contrast, the no-horn sign imposes a specific behavior by obliging the ego car to avoid sounding its horn in that area.\n\nIn terms of traffic lights, a red light is facing the ego car at the intersection, indicating that the ego car is required to stop and not proceed until the light turns green.\n\nLastly, the scene includes yellow temporary barriers on the left side of the road, which demarcate a construction zone. These barriers alert the ego car to the roadwork or obstruction ahead, guiding it to stay in the correct lane to circumvent the construction area.\n\nThere are no vehicles, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned in the data provided for this particular traffic scene."
