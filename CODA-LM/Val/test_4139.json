                "explanation": "The presence of a forklift on the road may indicate the existence of potential obstacles or ongoing road construction. Its position could also limit the lane width available for self-driving vehicles. A forklift is a potential hazard as it may operate differently from standard road vehicles and could make unpredictable movements or stops. Additionally, it may not be able to attain typical road speeds, necessitating cautious overtaking by self-driving vehicles."

The green light signifies that your vehicle has the right of way and may proceed through the intersection or follow the route, unless other road conditions or users necessitate a reduction in speed or coming to a stop."

        "description and explanation": "In the image, a red forklift is positioned to the right, partly occupying the rightmost lane. It seems to be either stationary or moving at a slow pace, with no signs of high-speed movement. The forklift suggests the likelihood of encountering obstacles or ongoing roadwork, reducing lane width for vehicles. Because forklifts may behave unpredictably and are slower than standard vehicles, caution is advised when overtaking.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light indicating that vehicles in the corresponding lane are cleared to go. Despite the right of way, drivers should remain vigilant, especially due to the proximity of the forklift and potential roadwork indicated by the presence of green fencing along the road. The fencing signals a construction or roadwork area, delineating zones where vehicles should be cautious of irregular traffic patterns and maintain a safe distance from the barriers for safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current road conditions, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed, readying to decelerate or change lanes at any moment to accommodate any necessary adjustments due to stopped forklifts. A green traffic light indicates legal passage, but the vehicle should stay alert to any unexpected movements by forklifts or potentially present construction workers. Obstacles suggest there might be a road construction zone, so any signs or signals that may temporarily alter traffic rules should be given extra attention. The vehicle should also check for any road work signs around the corners of obstacles or any other vehicles that are about to enter the road. Considering the current traffic situation, maintain a safe following distance from the forklifts, prepared for any sudden stops or movements, and overtake safely when necessary. Moreover, stay vigilant of any potential road changes or blockages that green obstacles might cause. Since the traffic light is green, proceed with caution, respecting any necessary adjustments due to forklifts and obstacles.",

In the context of future driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of a construction vehicle indicates potential construction activity in the area. The ego car should proceed with caution, remaining vigilant for construction workers, unexpected obstacles, or changes to traffic patterns. Additionally, the driver may have to be prepared for possible stop-and-go traffic or detours depending on the nature and extent of the construction work.",
