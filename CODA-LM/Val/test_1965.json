On the right side of the road, there is a long line of stationary trucks stretching into the distance, reducing the available lane width. A black car is situated ahead in the same lane but facing in the opposite direction, which may affect the speed and travel of the ego car. A red truck is positioned diagonally across from the vehicle on the right side, possibly indicating it is entering or leaving a work zone or parking spot, potentially starting to move. Additionally, there is a large orange truck partially on the road and partially on the shoulder, facing the same direction as our vehicle, creating an obstacle that must be avoided. Finally, several trucks and vehicles are parked on the left side of the road, aligned in the same direction as the ego car, and they might enter the traffic flow, necessitating monitoring for movement."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain an adequate distance from the vehicle ahead to ensure a safe stopping distance. Due to parked or halted trucks causing the road to narrow, drive carefully to prevent unexpected obstacles or pedestrians from suddenly appearing. Moreover, in the absence of visible lane markings, be prepared at all times for other vehicles to potentially switch lanes unpredictably, and adjust your position accordingly. If the black car ahead comes to a stop, be ready to stop or go around it, if it's safe to do so. Upon encountering red or orange trucks that are starting to move, slow down and be ready to stop or yield. Keep a safe distance from parked vehicles, staying alert for workers or unexpected obstacles that may emerge around the trucks. Exercise caution when overtaking parked trucks, making sure there is ample clear space.",

It appears to be a dump truck, with a distinctive open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic rams to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be deposited on the ground behind the truck. In this scenario, such a vehicle exiting the construction site onto the road may require the driver of the ego car to slow down or stop to give way, depending on the traffic conditions and any traffic control signs or signals present.",
