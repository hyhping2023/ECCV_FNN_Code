This truck poses a potential obstacle, indicating probable traffic congestion or an active loading/unloading zone that the ego car must be cautious of.\n\nMultiple traffic lights ahead show green illumination. These green traffic lights signal that it is permissible for the ego car to proceed if it is safe to do so.\n\nReflective traffic cones are lined on both sides of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating a narrowed path and potential lane merging or road work ahead. These cones necessitate reduced speeds and heightened attentiveness to safely navigate through the constricted area.\n\nAdditionally, temporary reflective barriers are placed alongside the traffic cones, further emphasizing the lane borders and the need for caution. These barriers clearly define the driving path and underscore the importance of precise lane navigation to avoid collisions.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic signs, or other objects are present in the image."
