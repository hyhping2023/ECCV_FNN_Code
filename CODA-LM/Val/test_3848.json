This van's position on the road could obstruct our vehicle's path or reduce visibility when maneuvering around it. Ahead on the right, several vehicles are parked along the road, which may create dynamic situations such as car doors opening, pedestrians appearing suddenly, or vehicles abruptly entering the road.\n\nAdditionally, in the distance on the right side of the picture, there is a person standing next to a truck, facing the truck. This pedestrian's proximity to both the road and other vehicles signals that they might step onto the roadway, requiring drivers to stay cautious.\n\nFurther, there are yellow and red obstacles blocking part of the sidewalk and encroaching upon the road. These barriers necessitate careful navigation around them, potentially using the space normally occupied by pedestrians."

Exercise caution when passing vehicles and trucks parked on the right-hand side; pay special attention to pedestrians and potential hidden road users. Ensure that your headlights provide maximum visibility and continue to monitor for any new hazards that may arise in these low-light conditions. Considering the parked van and the narrowing lane obstacles, this vehicle should also use lights to increase visibility and alert other road users of its presence.",
