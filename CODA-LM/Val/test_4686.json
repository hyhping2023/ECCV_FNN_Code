This positioning of the truck necessitates that other vehicles use the left lane to pass it. The image also shows multiple construction workers around a construction area to the right of the road. The proximity of these workers to the traffic lane introduces a potential hazard, as they might inadvertently step into the lane. Although there are no pertinent traffic signs visible in the image, the standard road rules continue to apply due to the absence of specific signage. Likewise, there are no traffic lights in the image, which means that the ego vehicle must navigate based on the current road conditions and adhere to general traffic laws.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the left side, demarcating the boundary of the construction zone and indicating a reduced driving path that requires careful navigation. Additionally, temporary road barriers are installed on the left, marking the edge of the construction zone; these barriers are there to protect the work area and to encourage vehicles to keep a safe distance from the workers and their workspace.\n\nOther object categories, such as debris or dustbins, are not present in the image, as indicated by the empty category for 'other objects'."
