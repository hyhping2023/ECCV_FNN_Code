        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several elements that the ego vehicle must consider.\n\nFirstly, there is a black SUV on the left, adjacent to the ego vehicle; both vehicles are facing the same direction. This SUV may impact the ego car's behavior, as it could change lanes or adjust its speed, necessitating the ego car to accordingly adapt its lane choice and speed regulation.\n\nAhead of the ego car and to the right, there is a forklift oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel. This forklift represents a potential hazard, as it could enter the ego vehicle's path or cause an obstruction. The ego car needs to be prepared to control its speed prudently and be ready to stop if necessary.\n\nAlso present are directional and location signs mounted on a pole above the road, situated ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. While these signs provide vital navigational information about directions and destinations, they don't directly impact immediate driving maneuvers. Nevertheless, they should be noted for navigation.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are multiple red and white traffic cones indicating a section of construction work or a lane closure. These cones mark a no-entry zone for the ego car, making it necessary to switch lanes if it is currently traveling in the lane being closed.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary orange and white construction barriers on the right that suggest active roadwork or a lane closure ahead. These barriers convey that the area ahead is inaccessible for the ego car, and again, a lane change might be required to continue safely on the road.\n\nThe other categories including vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects contain no items, suggesting there are no such elements in the traffic image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
