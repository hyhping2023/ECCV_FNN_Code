It suggests that the lane is currently occupied and the truck could affect our speed and distance keeping. Its large size and amber light suggests it could be moving slower or stopping for operations, necessitating caution from the ego-vehicle."

The truck could affect the ego carâ€™s speed and distance keeping due to its large size and potential for slower movement or stops. To the left of the ego car, there is a partially visible black Volkswagen Santana 3000 sedan. The ego car should monitor this sedan as it might change lanes or adjust its speed. Additionally, multiple vehicles ahead, including a white sedan and a white SUV, do not pose immediate threats but require the ego vehicle's attention for potential lane changes or stops.\n\nA directional sign overhead indicates Huangxing Rd. to the left and Zhongshan Rd. straight ahead, providing necessary navigation context for route planning. Directly ahead, a traffic light displays a red signal, necessitating the ego car to stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding. \n\nOn the right side of the road, several bicycles are parked within marked spaces near a parking sign with a bicycle symbol. The ego car should be cautious to ensure no cyclists are moving in or out of these parking spaces."

Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, remain in the current lane unless a lane change is necessary for the next turn. Come to a stop at the red light and wait for it to turn green before proceeding. Continuously monitor all vehicles in proximity for lane changes or other maneuvers, and observe the bicycles to ensure no cyclist enters the roadway unexpectedly. If proceeding straight, ensure visibility on the straight-ahead traffic light and follow the appropriate signal for movement. If turning right, follow the green turn light but remain cautious of other road users who may be doing the same."
