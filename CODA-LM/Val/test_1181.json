On the left side of the frame, there is a cement mixer truck facing a direction perpendicular to our vehicle, partially deviating from the lane. Its location may indicate recent or ongoing construction work, and as the current status of the mixer is unclear, caution is required. In the center of the right side of the image, there is a stationary green dump truck, also facing perpendicular to our vehicle, within its lane. Given the size and location of the truck, any accidental movement could obstruct vision and pose potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there are various buildings and signs along the roadside. While they do not directly affect driving behavior, they could distract attention or partially obstruct the view. Itâ€™s important to focus on the road and obstacles ahead, avoiding distractions from the roadside scenery."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to construction vehicles being present on the road with unclear conditions, please drive cautiously. Maintain a safe following distance, be ready at all times to respond to vehicles merging from the right, and pay attention to whether stationary vehicles show signs of starting. This vehicle should keep a safe distance from the green truck, and if the truck suddenly changes lanes or the concrete mixer begins to move, be prepared to slow down. If the left lane is safe and feasible, consider changing lanes to overtake the green truck, while also being ready for potential glare from the sun disrupting vision and sensor performance. This vehicle should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from large trucks, and be ready at all times for possible sudden movements from trucks on the right. Speed should be adjusted to ensure there is sufficient reaction time to deal with any obstructions or movements that large vehicles might cause. Continuous monitoring of these vehicles and any changes in their behavior is crucial. Unless the truck shows signs of merging into the current lane, stay in the current lane, be ready to slow down, and prepare to stop if necessary.",
