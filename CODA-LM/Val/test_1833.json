    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, observe whether the red SUV is changing lanes or merging, and be mindful of signs that may indicate changes in road patterns or construction zones. Be prepared to navigate around obstacles on the road and exercise caution with construction activities, which may require you to reduce speed or change lanes. Slow down and keep a prudent distance from the unstable yellow tractor, and be ready to stop or yield if it enters your lane. Additionally, be aware of vehicles or pedestrians that may be obscured by billboards on the right side. Keep a safe distance from the black car ahead, pay attention to pedestrians on the left, stay alert for potential hazards, and be ready to change lanes or adjust your speed in response to traffic cones ahead that may indicate obstructions or roadwork. Furthermore, pay attention to signs that may contain traffic information.",
