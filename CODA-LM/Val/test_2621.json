The truck's rear lights and reflective markings are visible, which is critical as it impacts the ego car's maneuverability and speed. Due to the truck's position and size, it significantly obstructs the view of the road ahead, necessitating cautious driving.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are no pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists visible in the vicinity, thereby reducing the risk of accidents that could involve these groups.\n\nAn informational sign indicating a bus station is mounted on the right side of the road. This bus station sign suggests that buses may frequently stop and start along this segment of the road, influencing how the ego car navigates this area.\n\nThere are no traffic lights visible in the image. The absence of traffic lights means the ego car must rely on other environmental cues and the behavior of the vehicle ahead to make safe driving decisions.\n\nNo traffic cones are present in the area, indicating that there are no immediate lane closures or construction warnings that the ego car needs to be aware of.\n\nHowever, there are barriers on the left side of the road, sectioning off an area filled with debris. This likely indicates ongoing construction or a road blockage, suggesting potential lane closures or detours ahead that require the ego car to navigate carefully.\n\nAdditionally, a pile of debris is spotted next to the barriers on the left side of the road. This debris, likely related to the ongoing construction or recent roadwork, could pose a hazard if it encroaches onto the driving lane, necessitating increased vigilance and readiness to react from the ego car."

These vehicles are typically used at construction sites and can be found on roads when they are being transported or are part of roadwork operations. When driving behind such a vehicle, it is important to maintain a safe following distance due to their heavy weight and potentially slower acceleration and deceleration.

Given the dimensions, they can obscure the driver's view ahead. When following a truck, the ego car should increase following distance to ensure enough time and space to react to the truck's actions, such as sudden braking or turning. The driver should also be cautious when considering overtaking, as trucks have large blind spots and may not easily notice smaller vehicles.",

Stay alert to the right side's barriers and debris, as they may affect traffic flow and available roadway. Do not attempt to overtake the truck before confirming the adjacent lane is clear and safe. Watch for any signals from the truck indicating a turn or stop, especially near the bus station area, and be mindful of buses merging into or out of traffic. Since there is debris to the left, the ego car should stay in the current lane, avoiding any potential hazards from the construction or roadworks area. Caution should be taken in case of sudden lane closures or detours due to the barriers."
