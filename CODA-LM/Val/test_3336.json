        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements affecting driving behavior:\n\nVehicles:\n1. Parked vehicles are lining the side of the road with their taillights on, indicating they are inactive. These do not pose an immediate threat but reduce the available road width for the ego car, necessitating caution.\n2. Moving vehicles are present ahead in the same lane as the ego car, as indicated by their red taillights. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from these vehicles and be alert for any sudden stops or turns they may execute.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. The image contains what appears to be a rectangular sign on the right side, but the details are indistinct due to blurriness. While the exact message of the sign isn't clear, the ego car should stay alert for possible changes in traffic conditions or regulations.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. A yellow traffic light is spotted in the distance on the right-hand side of the road. This indicates that the light is about to turn red, prompting the ego car to prepare to stop if it cannot safely pass through the intersection before the light turns red.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. The camera lens appears to be either dirty or wet, leading to reflections and light flares that obscure visibility. This can impair the ego car's ability to accurately interpret its surroundings or react in time to road users and traffic signals. Ensuring a clean lens is crucial for the optimal function of the vehicle's sensing and perception systems.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or barriers are detected in the image.\n"

Additionally, ensure the camera or sensor system is cleaned to improve visibility and response to the driving environment."
