It seems to be either stationary or progressing slowly, suggesting that the ego car may need to consider slowing down or changing lanes to keep a safe distance from this vehicle.\n\nOverhead directional signs are also present, yet their visibility is compromised by unfavorable conditions. These signs are crucial for the ego car as they provide necessary navigational information and ensure that the vehicle remains in the appropriate lane for its intended journey.\n\nTraffic lights are seen overhead, currently displaying green for the lane of the ego car, which allows it to proceed. However, the ego car should stay alert and be ready for any potential changes in the light signal.\n\nAdditionally, a number of yellow traffic cones are spotted ahead on the right side of the road. These cones suggest the presence of a road hazard or ongoing construction work. Consequently, the ego car should reduce its speed and be ready to adjust its path to avoid any safety risks."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is typically used to redirect traffic temporarily. The primary color appears to be fluorescent orange, a standard color for such devices, making them highly visible. Traffic cones are often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when an area of the roadway is not safe to use. For an autonomous vehicle or a human driver, the presence of a traffic cone would indicate the need to slow down or merge into an adjacent lane to avoid the unsafe area or construction zone.",
