It is partially on the roadway and partially on the sidewalk, which narrows the available driving space on the road. Because of this, it's necessary for our vehicle to potentially alter its current trajectory to safely navigate around the parked vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a potential hazard on the road in the form of an animal, which appears to be a dog, lying near the center of the lane ahead on the right side. Since animals can act unpredictably, this poses a safety risk, requiring the vehicle to be prepared to make sudden changes to speed or direction to avoid a collision. \n\nOther categories such as traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not contain information in this data, suggesting they are not present or relevant in this traffic image, and therefore there is no need to adjust driving behavior for these factors."

Be prepared to stop or yield to oncoming traffic that may need to pass, as the actual usable road width is diminished. Stay alert for road users who may suddenly emerge from gaps between buildings or parked vehicles. Slow down to ensure you have enough reaction time in case parked vehicles begin to move or to safely handle moderate road conditions.",
