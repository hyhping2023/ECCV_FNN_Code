Due to its volume and potential unpredictability, this vehicle could slow down the traffic or make unexpected moves."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene before us, we have several road users and road-related structures to consider for the autonomous vehicle's driving strategy.\n\nFirstly, we encounter a large green and orange truck traveling in the same direction as our autonomous vehicle, located in our lane. The truck is notable for the mechanical equipment attached to its rear. Due to its imposing size and potentially slower speed, the truck could disrupt the usual traffic flow, necessitating other vehicles, including ours, to slow down or seek alternate lanes to pass.\n\nFurthermore, there is a dark hatchback on the left side of our vehicle, slightly ahead, and it is moving in the same direction as we are. This hatchback necessitates close observation as it may change lanes or alter its speed, thus impacting the surrounding traffic, including our autonomous vehicle.\n\nOn our right side, occupying the adjacent lane, there is a gray sedan that is angled forward. The proximity of this sedan to our vehicle means that we must pay careful attention to it, as its potential lane changes or speed variations could influence our driving decisions.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned vehicles, a white sedan in the distance has been spotted in the right lane relative to our autonomous vehicle. The behavior and velocity of this distant sedan are factors that may affect the spacing to the vehicle ahead of us and could lead us to consider lane changes or speed adaptations.\n\nAs the only road structure to take into account, there is a concrete barrier on the right-hand side of the road. This barrier demarcates the division of the highway, suggesting that for overtaking maneuvers or exiting the highway, we must position our vehicle to the left.\n\nIn this scene, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects that have been reported. Therefore, our driving strategy can exclusively focus on the movement and behavior of the vehicles and the physical road barrier highlighted in this summary."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead and be prepared to change lanes when its speed significantly reduces traffic flow. Also, monitor the position of the hatchback on the left and the gray sedan on the right to predict any potential lane changes. Given the reduced visibility, it is advised to proceed with caution, possibly slowing down to ensure safety. Be prepared for speed variations that may occur due to service vehicles occupying the road ahead. Since there are no visible traffic lights or signs, continue to follow standard highway driving protocols, use the left lane to overtake if necessary, while respecting lane markings and speed limits.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, typically used at construction sites or for road work activities. Its presence suggests that there might be construction or maintenance work happening ahead on the road. This indicates that the driver of the ego car should proceed with caution, be prepared for potential changes in traffic flow, such as lane closures, reduced speed limits, or the presence of workers and machinery on the road. The driver may also need to change lanes if the construction vehicle is obstructing the current lane or follow signs and signals directing traffic around the work zone.",
