        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users to take note of. Directly ahead of the ego car, within the same lane, there is a large blue truck that appears either stationary or to be moving at a slow pace. This truck is easily identified by its visible license plate and reflective warning patterns on the back. The presence of the truck is important because it could potentially slow down or stop abruptly, possibly obstructing the ego car's view of the road ahead, thereby necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, a white bus adorned with green markings is traveling in the left lane, adjacent to the lane of the ego car. The bus and the ego car seem to be moving at speeds in line with the traffic flow. The bus's presence is relevant because it is in motion and due to its larger turning radius, there is a chance that the bus might encroach into the ego car's lane, which could influence the driving strategy of the autonomous system.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, there is a cyclist riding in the same direction as the traffic. The cyclist's movements could be unpredictable, potentially necessitating adjustments to the ego car's trajectory.\n\nThere is no information about traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image, so these categories do not require attention in this particular scene."

Be aware of the bus in the left lane, checking mirrors and blind spots before any potential lane change. Keep an eye on the cyclist to the right, ensuring not to encroach on their space and anticipate any possible movements into the lane. If the situation allows and it is safe to do so, consider safely changing lanes to the left to overtake the truck, but only if it is clear of the bus and the action does not pose a risk to the cyclist or other road users. Additionally, avoid making any sudden lane changes without clear visibility and confirmation that it is safe to do so, bearing in mind the proximity of the bus and cyclist. Continue to scan the environment for any additional road users or changes in traffic dynamics."
