        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are parked cars on both sides of the road. Some of these parked cars are partially covered with car covers, clearly indicating that they are stationary and unlikely to move soon. Several cars seem to be unoccupied as evidenced by the protective covers over them, while others that are not covered show a white color. The presence of these vehicles narrows the drivable road space and there's a risk they may conceal pedestrians or other obstacles from view. Consequently, the ego car must navigate the stretch of road cautiously.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is observed at a distance on the right side of the road. This indicates that the ego car has the right of way to continue moving forward. Despite the green signal, vigilance is advised due to potential changes to a yellow light and the presence of parked cars which may impact road visibility. It is imperative for the ego car to remain aware of its surroundings to adjust its driving behavior accordingly."

The ego car should maintain a safe distance while passing to prevent any collisions in case the parked car's doors open or if it begins to move unexpectedly.",
