Additionally, a white car is ahead within the same lane, engaging its brake lights, which dictates the pace and spacing the ego car must maintain.\n\nWhile no vulnerable road users or traffic signs are present in this image, there is an absence of visible traffic lights, leading to the conclusion that the ego car should exercise caution and remain vigilant for any indication of the current traffic signals or look for cues based on the behavior of surrounding traffic.\n\nThere are barriers to note as well: a median barrier separates the traffic in opposite directions which helps in lane guidance for the ego car, and a distinct road barrier to the left suggests a possible construction zone or lane closures that require attention and potential alteration in usual traffic patterns."

Proceed with caution due to the wet road conditions and be mindful of potential road work indicated by the barrier. Without clear visibility of traffic lights, follow the cues of other vehicles and standard traffic regulations. Drive defensively in these low-visibility conditions, with an increased readiness to respond to unexpected actions from the truck or any unforeseen hazards. Increase the following distance from the white car ahead to ensure a safe stopping distance in case of sudden braking. Do not attempt to change lanes to the left as it is currently occupied by the white car. Continuously monitor for traffic lights and signs to ensure compliance with traffic laws."
