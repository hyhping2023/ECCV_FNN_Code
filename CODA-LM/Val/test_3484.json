The truck occupies the entire width of the lane and is moving in the same direction as the ego car. This vehicle poses a risk due to its size and the potential for dropping debris, necessitating an increased following distance for the ego car to allow for safe reaction time if the truck slows down or stops unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones lining the edge of the left lane, which indicate potential road work or a lane closure ahead. The presence of these cones suggests that caution is needed, and there may be a requirement for lane merging and a reduction in speed.\n\nFurthermore, there are some specks on the windshield, which could be water drops or dirt. These specks might slightly impair the sensor visibility of the ego car, making it necessary to use windshield wipers or cleaning systems to ensure optimal sensor function for autonomous driving."

            "description and explanation": "The image shows a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. This type of vehicle is designed to transport and mix concrete while on the road. It usually includes a rotating drum to keep the cement mixture mobile and prevent it from hardening. Since these vehicles are heavy and often slower-moving, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for the longer stopping distance of the heavy vehicle and its potentially unpredictable movements. It's also important to be cautious of potential debris that might fall from such a vehicle and to be prepared for sudden stops or turns as it approaches a construction site.",

Monitor the truck's signals for any indication of turning or stopping, and be prepared to adjust speed accordingly. Use windshield cleaning mechanisms if necessary to maintain clear visibility. Maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck and prepare to merge left if necessary, due to the partly protruding mixer chute and potential road work indicated by the traffic cones. Monitor the truck's signals closely for any indication of its intentions. Decrease speed appropriately to handle potential hazards and stay alert for any road workers or additional signs that may provide further instruction on how to navigate the upcoming roadwork."
