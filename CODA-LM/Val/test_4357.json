        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a significant presence of a large truck on the right side. It can be characterized by its cargo area being covered with a grey tarp and the bottom part of its trailer adorned with red reflective tape. Although the truck's cab isn't within the field of view, the size and position of the truck relative to the ego car suggest that the ego car might be in the process of overtaking the truck or traveling beside it. This is important as the truck could substantially limit the ego car's visibility and maneuverability, posing a risk by potentially obscuring the view of the road ahead or even drifting into the ego carâ€™s lane. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the provided data."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a side view of a large commercial vehicle, likely a truck trailer. It has a flatbed body covered with a tarp to protect the cargo. Given its size, the commercial vehicle will have a slower acceleration and deceleration rate compared to smaller vehicles. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for the truck's potential wide turning radius and longer stopping distance when braking.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck, ensure there is enough space to complete an overtake if in progress, and be cautious of potential blind spots that the truck's size may create. If the truck is in an adjacent lane, be prepared for possible lane changes by the truck driver and keep an eye on the truck's indicators. Maintain a safe following distance, and prepare to adapt speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid any sudden movements by the truck. Continuous monitoring of the truck's indicators or brake lights is essential to anticipate any lane changes or stops. Depending on the overall traffic situation, consider adjusting the lane position slightly to the left to improve the field of view if safe to do so without risking a lane departure. If the truck signals an intention to change lanes or turn, the ego vehicle should adjust speed or change lanes accordingly to maintain safety."
