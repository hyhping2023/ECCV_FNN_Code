        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario as described contains one notable road user, which is a significant vehicle. A large container truck is driving ahead of the ego car, easily identifiable by its distinctive lettering and numbers 'FC6120' on the back, as well as reflective safety markings and a displayed contact phone number. The presence of this container truck directly influences the driving behavior of the ego car. Due to the truck's size and its speed, it is crucial for the ego car to maintain an appropriate following distance for safety. Furthermore, the ego car must remain prepared to make necessary lane changes or execute overtaking maneuvers if the situation demands. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this scene that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large, commercial heavy vehicle, commonly referred to as a truck. It has a container on its rear which appears to be for transporting goods, likely a cargo or freight container. The rear of the truck features reflective safety markings to enhance visibility and safety compliance. The future driving behavior of the ego car will involve maintaining a safe distance from this truck due to its size and potential for reduced maneuverability. Overtaking should be performed with caution, ensuring clear visibility and adequate space due to the truck's length and possible blind spots.",
