This requires attention as there is a possibility of movement from the car or unexpected door openings into traffic. There are no vulnerable road users present in the scene.\n\nAs for traffic regulations, a No Parking sign is posted on the right side, indicating a zone where vehicles are not permitted to stop which is being respected by drivers in the vicinity. Additionally, a No Horn sign signifies the prohibition of horn use, highlighting the need for a quieter environment, potentially indicating the proximity to sensitive areas like hospitals or schools.\n\nThe image lacks traffic lights, necessitating a reliance on traffic signs and established right-of-way rules to navigate the traffic scene effectively.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are lined up on the right, signifying a work zone or an off-limits area, which as a result, reduces the width of the drivable road. Furthermore, white concrete barriers are positioned to distinctly separate the sidewalk from the road, safeguarding pedestrians.\n\nOther noteworthy objects include a surveillance camera attached to a pole on the right, denoting active road surveillance, and a mix of vehicles and bicycles parked alongside the sidewalk, behind concrete barriers. Although these are not directly impeding the vehicle's path, they are indicative of possible pedestrian activity and the potential for sudden door openings that the ego vehicle must be aware of."

Maintain a safe distance from the parked car on the right to avoid any potential hazards such as the door opening. Adhere to the No parking and No horn regulations as indicated by the traffic signs.
