The ego car should be prepared to slow down or change lanes if it becomes necessary to overtake the truck, though this should be done with caution and while observing any surrounding traffic. Additionally, stay alert for any signage indicating exits or special conditions to ensure proper navigation and compliance with traffic laws. If an upcoming exit is required, prepare for a lane change by checking mirrors and blind spots, and signaling in advance. Continue to monitor the road for any new developments such as changes in traffic flow or the appearance of other road users."
