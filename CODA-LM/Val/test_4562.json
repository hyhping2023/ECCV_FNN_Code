The visibility of the vehicle and its indications of motion necessitate the maintenance of a safe following distance, as its presence and actions markedly influence the driving decisions of the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes multiple traffic cones strategically placed in a line to highlight the curve of the road while also segregating traffic lanes. These cones are a clear signal suggesting potential road narrowing or ongoing road work ahead, thereby urging drivers to decelerate and approach with heightened caution.\n\nFurthermore, concrete barriers are present on the right side of the road, positioned between the road itself and the line of traffic cones. These barriers create a tangible division from adjacent areas, stressing the importance of remaining within the current lane. This setup plays a crucial role in preventing any unintended crossing into oncoming traffic lanes or restricted zones."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a safety device used in road management. Typically conical in shape and brightly colored, often orange, with reflective striping for high visibility at night or in inclement weather. They are used to channel traffic, indicate temporary deviations from standard traffic patterns, or to protect an area that may pose a hazard to vehicles or pedestrians. In this context, the cone seems to be placed near the edge of a traffic island or median to warn the driver of the ego vehicle to stay in the lane and not veer too close to the divider, ensuring the driver's safety and the smooth flow of traffic around what could be a construction zone or an area with potential hazards.",
