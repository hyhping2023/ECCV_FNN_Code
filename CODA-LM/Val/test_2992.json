However, there are vulnerable road users and other objects of interest.\n\nWe have two individuals standing by large spools of cable off the roadway on the right side of the image, facing away from the ego-vehicleâ€™s perspective. Although they are not on the driving path, their close proximity to the roadside may present a potential hazard if they unexpectedly enter the road.\n\nAdditionally, various industrial objects, including large cable spools and potential debris, are located near the roadside. These objects are not currently on the road but can be distractive or might cause obstruction if they move or if smaller, unseen objects roll onto the roadway. Specific concern is noted for large cable spools resting close to the roadside, which could also roll or shift into the path of travel, creating a possible hazard."
