It is important to note that since the sedan is moving in the same direction and is at a certain distance, immediate action by our car may not be necessary. However, it is crucial to maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are piles of debris or trash bags stacked on the right-side sidewalk. While these objects are not on the road surface, it is advisable to exercise caution when operating on the roadside. This is to prevent any sudden movement of the debris or the possibility of debris splashing onto the road, which could affect driving conditions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
