The presence of this large vehicle may block the view of the road ahead and the adjacent lanes, potentially affecting driving decisions. Additionally, there is a traffic light ahead showing a green signal, which indicates that vehicles are permitted to proceed through the intersection without stopping. Along the right side of the main lane, traffic cones are set up, narrowing the lane and possibly signaling road work or lane closures. Drivers should approach this area with caution and may need to reduce speed to navigate safely. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, and other objects are not present in this image."
