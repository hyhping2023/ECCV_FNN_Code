These signs include a speed limit sign of 40 km/h, no parking, no stopping, and no entry for all vehicles except bicycles going in the direction indicated. The presence of these signs is crucial as they inform the ego car of the speed limit and restrictions on parking, stopping, and turning, which are critical for legal and safe maneuvering on the road.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange and white traffic cones placed in a diagonal line that narrows the drivable area on the right side, indicating that the lane is merging or closed ahead. These cones suggest that there may be road work ahead or a change in the normal driving path, requiring the driver to proceed with caution and possibly merge into another lane.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, large, white barriers with blue and white striped markings are positioned at the roadside. These barriers partially enclose the traffic cones and delineate the construction or no-entry area. They serve to reinforce the adjustment to the traffic pattern due to construction or road maintenance, ensuring drivers stay within the defined driving lanes.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or other objects reported in the image."
