These individuals are not on the road and are separated by obstacles, which indicates that they do not currently pose a threat to the traffic flow.\n\nIn the traffic cones category, multiple cones are lined up in a straight line, highlighting a boundary or a closed lane ahead. This setup indicates that vehicles should not cross the line of cones, as it might represent areas where vehicle traffic is restricted.\n\nThe barriers observed are yellow and black temporary barriers placed at what seems to be an entrance or exit, likely indicating restricted access. This signifies that private vehicles are prohibited from entering this area and alternative routes may be necessary if access is required."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to reduced visibility at night, compounded by the presence of traffic cones, unclear signage, and obstacles, the vehicle should proceed with caution and slow down. If signs indicate upcoming restrictions, the vehicle should be prepared to stop or change direction and must not attempt to cross the boundaries marked by the cone-shaped signs or enter restricted areas. Pay attention to any additional signs or signals that may clarify the restrictions for that area. Be cautious of individuals near obstacles on the left, paying close attention to their potential signals, as they may indicate an intention to enter the roadway. Adhere to the areas demarcated by traffic cones, and avoid them when needing to make a left turn or detour. The vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop at control points where it may be required. The driver should be alert to any directives from personnel or signage, safely navigate the passage points, and be ready to present any necessary documentation or pay any fees.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is typically used to direct traffic by designating specific areas not to be accessed by vehicles or pedestrians. It is essential for the safety of both the traffic and the people involved in roadside activities. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone indicates a restriction or guidance in the path of the ego car, possibly suggesting that there is a closed lane or a detour ahead that the driver will need to adhere to, thereby affecting the vehicle's path of travel.",
