The truck's presence reduces the available lane width and obstructs the driver's view of pedestrians or other road users. This could potentially limit the visibility of hazards from the right side and necessitate a change in the vehicle's driving path.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:** A pedestrian is walking along the side of the road, approaching the parked truck on the right. The contrast between the pedestrian's clothing and the truck makes the pedestrian visible from the vehicle. Drivers must be ready to slow down or stop as pedestrians might suddenly enter the vehicle's path, ensuring everyone's safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "As there are pedestrians near the roadside, the self-driving car should reduce its speed and prepare to stop if necessary. Maintain a safe distance from the white passenger car in front and be mindful of any sudden stops or changes in speed. The truck parked on the right also narrows the available road width, so be cautious of oncoming traffic when overtaking or passing by the truck. On slippery roads, increase the following distance to accommodate for longer braking distances. Given these conditions, proactive and focused driving is crucial for safety. The self-driving car should travel at a safe speed, taking into account the risks posed by parked trucks and pedestrians. Maintain a safe distance from the SUV parked by the roadside and be prepared to stop or slow down at any time to respond to pedestrians unexpectedly entering the road. Additionally, be alert to any movement of the parked truck, which may indicate it is preparing to merge into traffic, and be ready to safely adjust the vehicle's position within the lane or reduce speed accordingly.",

            "description and explanation": "A pedestrian is a person traveling on foot, whether walking or running. In a traffic context, pedestrians are not confined to vehicle traffic and can move in areas such as sidewalks, crosswalks, or even on the road, depending on the situation. In this scenario, the identified pedestrian appears to be close to or possibly in the roadway, potentially creating a situation where the ego vehicle must be prepared to slow down or stop to ensure the safety of the pedestrian. The presence of a pedestrian indicates that the driver must exercise increased caution, adhere to any relevant pedestrian right-of-way laws, and be ready to adjust the vehicle's speed and trajectory accordingly.",
