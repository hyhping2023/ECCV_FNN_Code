        "description and explanation": "In the identified traffic scenario, a white sedan with headlights turned on is positioned directly ahead on the center of the driving lane, facing the opposite direction. This necessitates maintaining a safe distance due to its potential impact on the vehicle’s speed and braking distance.\n\nAdjacent to the road, several pedestrians are noticed near a marked crosswalk, suggesting their potential to enter the roadway. This requires the vehicle to be prepared for a possible stop or to yield.\n\nTwo traffic signs are visible: one indicating a pedestrian crossing and another displaying multiple messages including no parking and a speed limit of 15 kilometers per hour. The crossing sign warns of an area where pedestrians may cross, mandating reduced speed or stopping. The other sign dictates the maximum allowable speed and identifies zones where parking or stopping is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, on the left side of the road, yellow bollards act as barriers marking the separation between the roadway and pedestrian zones. These bollards restrict vehicular movement on the left and guide drivers to remain within designated lanes.\n\nLastly, reflections and glare seen on the windshield, likely from within the vehicle, could obstruct the driver’s vision. Actions to reduce this glare, such as adjusting internal lighting or repositioning objects inside the car, are advisable for safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the current road users and signs, our vehicle should travel at a speed not exceeding 15 kilometers per hour, maintain a safe distance from the sedan ahead, and be prepared to yield to pedestrians at crosswalks. The presence of taxis may lead pedestrians into the traffic flow, and motorcycles may change positions within the lane, hence extra caution is necessary. Moreover, our vehicle should avoid areas marked by traffic cones. It is advised to pay close attention to any traffic lights that may appear and to take measures to reduce glare on the windshield. As the road surface is slippery, please drive carefully, verify the status of the traffic lights, and be ready to yield to the white vehicle that is about to make a right turn.",
