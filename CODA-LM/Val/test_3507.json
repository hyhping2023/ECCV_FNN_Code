        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, an orange wheel loader is parked on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the lane and facing the ego vehicle. This situation may require the ego vehicle to either slow down or change lanes to navigate safely around the obstruction. Additionally, a line of vehicles, including a red truck followed by several cars, is queued in the opposite lane, facing away from the ego vehicle. This indicates potential oncoming traffic, necessitating that the ego vehicle remains in its lane and proceeds with caution. There is also a truck moving ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. The presence of this truck could potentially slow down traffic, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance or consider overtaking when it is safe and legal to do so. Furthermore, a white car is observed ahead on the left side, in an opposite lane. This vehicle should be monitored for any unexpected lane changes or turns that could affect the ego vehicle's path.\n\nApart from vehicles, there are utility pole and power lines on the right side of the road. While these objects do not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle, they should be noted in case of road work or obstacles that may involve these structures. The traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, indicating that these categories do not impact the current driving scenario."

It is a large, yellow-colored vehicle with a front-mounted bucket used for moving materials. The presence of this vehicle indicates that there may be construction activity taking place ahead. Consequently, the ego car may need to reduce speed and proceed with caution, obey any posted signs or signals, and be prepared to stop or navigate around the construction site. It suggests that there may be workers and additional machinery in the vicinity which could affect the traffic flow or road conditions.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the obstructed right lane caused by the parked wheel loader, the ego vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to either stop or change lanes to the left if necessary, after ensuring the left lane is clear of oncoming traffic. Caution should be maintained due to the line of traffic in the opposite lane, indicating potential stops or slow traffic movement ahead. Attention should be kept on any potential changes around the construction vehicle as it may signal a construction site that could affect traffic patterns. The ego car should also keep a safe distance behind the truck ahead, monitoring its speed and be prepared to overtake if it becomes necessary and is safe to do so. Regular checks in the opposite lane for the white car and any oncoming traffic are essential for safe driving."
