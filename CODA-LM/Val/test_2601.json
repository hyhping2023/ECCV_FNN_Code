Similarly, several cars are also parked parallel to the truck in the same direction, reducing the width of the lane further. On the other side, a cyclist is stationed on the right side of our vehicle, opposite to the direction of travel, representing a dynamic challenge as they could potentially maneuver to avoid obstacles, which could present a risk to the moving vehicle. Moreover, the roadside has various stationary objects, including a pile covered by a blue tarpaulin and several suitcases. These objects are not immediately threatening as they are out of the lane, but they should be monitored closely in case they or any nearby pedestrian activity might impact the vehicle's trajectory. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."
