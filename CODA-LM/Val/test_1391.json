Its operational equipment and potential debris could affect visibility and require a greater following distance due to its unpredictability.\n  - A white Volkswagen hatchback is directly ahead of the ego car, slightly to the left within the lane with its brake lights off. This proximity necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe following distance.\n  - Multiple vehicles are in the adjacent lanes to the left and right, with some displaying brake lights, indicating congested traffic conditions. These restrict the ego car's ability to change lanes and may influence its speed due to stop-and-go traffic.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A traffic light is visible in the upper right of the image, displaying a red color. This indicates that vehicles in the lanes controlled by this signal should be stopping, suggesting that the traffic ahead may be slowing down or stopped.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - Overhead decorations, resembling red lanterns, are hanging next to the traffic lights. While they do not directly impact driving behavior, they could potentially distract the driver or influence the visibility of the traffic signals from a distance.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers are detected in the image."
