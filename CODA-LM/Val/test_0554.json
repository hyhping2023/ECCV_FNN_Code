It is crucial to keep an eye on this vehicle's speed and trajectory as it could affect the lane choice and following distance of the ego car. Additionally, there are directional signs on the right-hand side of the road after a merger. These signs are likely to provide essential information about the upcoming road layout, which may require the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes. Furthermore, a line of traffic cones is present, indicating the merger of two lanes into one. These cones start on the right and taper into the ego car's lane, signaling that the ego car must alter its course to safely merge with the ongoing lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that need to be considered."
