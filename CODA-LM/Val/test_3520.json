        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image analyzed, two significant observations are noted. Firstly, there is a large red truck with its cargo compartment elevated, located directly in front of our vehicle in the same lane. This stationary truck constitutes a road obstacle that prevents our vehicle from passing. The elevated cargo bed suggests the truck is either in the process of unloading or has experienced a breakdown, potentially causing a considerable delay. Secondly, a dark sedan is observed on the right side, next to our vehicle. It appears to be moving forward and is only partially in view. This indicates a risk as the sedan might attempt a lane change or adjust its road position, posing a potential danger, especially if our vehicle is contemplating a lane switch. No other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present or noted in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should remain stationary and maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead to prevent any sudden changes in the truck's situation. At the same time, be aware of any lane-changing actions by the sedan on the right and prepare accordingly. There is no need to take immediate action before the truck moves or the traffic light changes. Furthermore, considering the unpredictability of the truck raising its bed, if possible and safe, it is recommended to change lanes to avoid potential hazards and to better observe the road ahead.",

This type of vehicle is typically used for transporting materials on construction sites. Due to its large size and the materials it carries, it could pose a potential risk of debris falling onto the road, which may influence the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible sudden stops or debris on the driving path.",
