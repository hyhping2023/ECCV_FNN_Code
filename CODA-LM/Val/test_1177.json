        "description and explanation": "The image depicts several road users. \n\nFirstly, there is a construction vehicle with a concrete conveyor belt extending upwards and towards the direction of an overpass, occupying the right half of the far-right lane. This vehicle's position and size could obstruct the view and partially block the lanes, necessitating lane-changing or slowing down for safe distance maintenance by autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the construction vehicle travels at a slower speed and may perform unexpected maneuvers.\n\nFurthermore, a temporary fence has been erected on the right side of the road, signaling ongoing construction or road renovation. This barrier requires vehicles to keep to the left to avoid potential hazards associated with the construction area.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the road, a row of shared bikes is arranged outside of some traffic cones. Although these bicycles are stationary and will not directly affect autonomous vehicle movement, their presence highlights a potential area for pedestrian or cyclist activity."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes to the left to safely pass construction vehicles. Maintain a safe following distance, closely monitor the movements of electric scooters and construction vehicles, and be ready to change lanes as needed. Adhere to lane markings set by traffic cones, and do not attempt to enter bicycle lanes or areas restricted by cones. Stay alert for other road users who may suddenly enter the road, especially near parked bicycles, and adjust your speed and position accordingly to ensure safety. It is recommended to keep to the left to avoid issues related to temporary fencing on the right.",
