        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements that influence driving behavior. Firstly, a large truck with a flatbed trailer is parked on the right side of the driveway, facing the same direction as traffic. It has reflective warning signs to alert other road users of its presence. The truck's position may obstruct part of our lane, necessitating an adjustment in the driving path to avoid potential collisions.\n\nAdditionally, several cars are parked on the left side of the road, interspersed with the trucks. The presence of these vehicles narrows the available road width, which requires careful navigation. Special attention is needed in case car doors open unexpectedly or pedestrians move between the parked cars.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights visible in the image, this absence means that the vehicle must proceed with caution, adhere to standard traffic rules, and give way to vehicles that have the right of way.\n\nLastly, the scene includes dim street lighting and the bright headlights from oncoming vehicles, which can significantly reduce visibility. This condition necessitates the use of appropriate vehicle lighting and heightened alertness to safely detect other road users and traffic control devices."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the current traffic conditions, autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead. If the truck partially occupies the driving lane, be prepared to safely adjust the lane position and use appropriate lighting to increase visibility. At the same time, monitor the road conditions, paying attention to other road users or signs not shown in this picture. When passing trucks and cars parked on the left, maintain a cautious speed to ensure there is enough distance to react to their any sudden movements or the potential appearance of pedestrians. Continue to monitor for any irregularities on the road or debris that may be difficult to see immediately due to poor lighting.",
