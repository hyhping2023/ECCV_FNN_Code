The autonomous vehicle must be aware of such vehicles to anticipate potential unexpected turns or obstacles emerging from the opposite side of the road.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A group of pedestrians on the central divider on the right, some donned in high-visibility jackets, pose a possible hazard. While they are not on the road at the moment, the car must remain alert to the chance of them stepping into the driving lane unexpectedly.\n- A cyclist on the right is riding at the edge of the carriageway, marked by a delivery box and wearing a blue jacket and helmet. The cyclist's proximity could pose a risk should they move into the car's lane.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- A line of traffic cones demarcates a work zone on the central divider from the lanes of moving traffic, signifying an altered traffic pattern and alerting drivers to possible hazards while directing the flow of vehicles for safe passage around the area.\n\nBarriers:\n- A blue and white striped barrier on the right separates the pedestrian walkway from the road. This signals to the vehicle that it needs to stay at a safe distance as it denotes a pedestrian zone or a work area adjacent to the carriageway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that need to be considered in the driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain the current lane and keep a safe distance from the taxi ahead. Be cautious of the motorcyclist on the right and avoid any sudden lane changes that might endanger the cyclist. Stay alert for pedestrians on the right and be prepared to slow down if necessary. Pay attention to traffic cones and obstacles, stay away from the right edge of the road, and be aware of possible road construction or obstacles. If the traffic light is for your lane, then be prepared to stop, while carefully navigating around any debris on the road, and always follow the lane markings indicated by the traffic cones. Keep a safe distance from the motorcyclist on the right, and due to the road space being occupied by obstacles and work areas, do not change lanes to the right.",
