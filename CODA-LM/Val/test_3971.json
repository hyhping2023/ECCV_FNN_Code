We need to be cautious around it, as it's parked and could either pull into traffic or open its doors without warning. On our right, a pedestrian wearing a blue shirt and dark pants is walking parallel to our direction of travel, which requires vigilance since they could step into the lane or pose a hazard when we are turning right. Additionally, a group of people is sitting under a nearby shelter on the right side. While they are not an immediate threat, it's important to monitor them in case they decide to walk onto the road. A billboard that's visible in the vicinity is not part of standardized traffic signage, so while it may not affect driving behavior, drivers should remain attentive to the road and not be distracted by the billboard content. Lastly, there's a temporary barrier wall established on the left side of the road marking a construction area. It requires reduced speed and careful driving due to the potential narrowing of the passable road area. Traffic lights, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects are not present in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and maintain a safe distance from parked vans to avoid the risk of their doors suddenly opening or the vans pulling into traffic unexpectedly. Additionally, watch for pedestrians on the right to ensure they do not step onto the road, and be mindful of individuals who may enter the roadway from bus stops. Slow down when approaching construction barriers and safely navigate through potentially narrower lanes. If pedestrians enter the street, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop. Stay alert for sudden movements from pedestrians in waiting areas. Focus on driving, avoid distraction by billboards, and be aware of road narrowing due to barriers. Furthermore, drive cautiously and be prepared to yield due to pedestrians approaching, complying with any traffic directions that security may issue. If necessary, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop to allow pedestrians to cross safely. Meanwhile, remain vigilant for other road users that may be obscured by pedestrians, vehicles on the right, and construction fences. Additionally, the driver should monitor the surroundings for any additional traffic signs or signals that may emerge as they progress.",
