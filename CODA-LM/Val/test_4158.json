        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a red SUV directly ahead with its brake lights on, signaling it may be slowing down or stopped, making it essential for self-driving vehicles to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, a large, multi-axled heavy-duty truck transporting construction equipment is present slightly ahead in the right adjacent lane, potentially affecting visibility and road conditions awareness for lane changes. There are also various vehicles in adjacent lanes, some in motion and others stationary due to the traffic light, underlining the importance of being vigilant of sudden lane changes or merging vehicles.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians are visible, and even though they're not crossing, self-driving cars should be cautious of their close proximity to the roadway as a potential risk. The traffic light ahead displays green for going straight and red for turning left, granting the right of way to vehicles proceeding straight while cautioning that the light could change to yellow soon, requiring readiness to stop and awareness of other vehicles' reactions to the light change.\n\nFurthermore, there is a median strip on the right that separates the road from the pedestrian sidewalk, clarifying that the driving space is limited to the left side of the barrier, and the vehicle must stay within these confines. Other categories such as traffic signs, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this scenario and hence not described."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the red SUV ahead, adjusting speed dynamically according to the SUV and truck's movements, and always be attentive to changes in traffic lights. Based on directional signs, a decision on lane changes should be made in advance, taking into account the desired driving route. Moreover, even if pedestrians are not on the road, our vehicle should continue to monitor their movements until safely past. The vehicle should keep an eye on large construction vehicles to the right to avoid any blind spots or sudden movements, and be prepared for possible changes in traffic lights. Pedestrians on the sidewalk should be monitored in case they step into the lane. Our vehicle should proceed on a green traffic light, but be ready to stop if the light changes, while always being vigilant for traffic flow alterations caused by the current positions of surrounding vehicles.",

            "description and explanation": "A heavy-duty construction vehicle is being transported on a trailer, characterized by its large size and the equipment it carries. This kind of vehicle influences the driving behavior by possibly reducing the speed of the flow of traffic due to its dimensions and weight, which may affect maneuverability and acceleration. Drivers should maintain a safe following distance when driving behind such a vehicle to allow for sufficient stopping distance and should be aware of potential wide turns it may perform. Additionally, drivers should be cautious of any loose debris that might fall from the construction vehicle.",
