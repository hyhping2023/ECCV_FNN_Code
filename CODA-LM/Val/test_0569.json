    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the truck's position and turn signal, the ego car should prepare to slow down and allow the truck to execute its maneuver. Additionally, the ego car should remain vigilant for any abrupt stops or turns from the truck. The presence of traffic cones suggests roadwork or obstacles, so the ego car should be ready to navigate around this potential hazard, possibly by changing lanes to the left if such a maneuver is safe and legal. Given the wet road conditions, the ego car should decrease speed and maintain a larger than usual following distance to account for increased braking distance and reduced traction. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck to allow for increased stopping time, especially under wet road conditions. Be prepared to stop or slow down if the truck brake lights indicate deceleration. Avoid the coned-off area by staying in the cleared lane. Drive cautiously in these wet conditions to prevent hydroplaning."
