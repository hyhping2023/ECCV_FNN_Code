While it does not immediately affect the path, it may obstruct the view of the traffic ahead. Additionally, in the distance, several cars are visible traveling in the opposite direction. These oncoming vehicles may influence the speed and lane choice as the vehicle approaches them.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is a motorcyclist dressed in blue and wearing a white helmet, positioned in their lane on the right side ahead. Given their vulnerability, it is important to maintain a greater following distance to ensure safety.\n\nRegarding traffic cones, red traffic cones are placed around a pedestrian crossing, suggesting that this area might be under construction or require a detour. These cones indicate that part of the road or crosswalk is not usable, prompting self-driving vehicles to potentially adjust their route."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the electric scooter, closely monitoring its speed and direction changes. Due to the parked box trucks and traffic cones as well as construction work indicated by barriers, your vehicle should be prepared to stay in the right lane. Exercise caution when overtaking the scooter, ensuring not to move into adjacent lanes until it is safe and the construction area is clear. Parked box trucks may obstruct the view, hiding potential hazards or traffic merging from the left, which should be given special attention. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, and consider the construction ahead when necessary, adjusting your lane position to the left moderately. Stay alert for road users coming out of the construction area or attempting to detour. If the motorcyclist or other road users slow down due to the construction area, be prepared to stop.",
