        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several key elements are present which significantly impact the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nThere is one vehicle on the right side of the ego car, partially visible and in motion, with its brake lights on. This suggests the vehicle is either slowing down or has come to a stop. Understanding the position and movement of this vehicle is crucial for the ego car as it determines the flow of traffic and highlights the necessity to maintain a safe following distance or be prepared to halt if the vehicle ahead is decelerating or stationary.\n\nAdditionally, a dog is spotted on the crosswalk ahead, in the lane adjacent to the left of the ego car, traversing from right to left. The presence of this dog on the road poses a significant safety hazard, potentially causing the ego car or other vehicles to execute sudden maneuvers to avoid a collision should the animal enter their path.\n\nThe traffic situation is further complicated by the traffic light conditions. Multiple traffic lights are in view, with the one applicable to the ego car's lane showing green, signaling the right of way to proceed. Conversely, the pedestrian signal across the intersection is red, indicating that pedestrians should not be crossing. Nevertheless, the presence of the dog on the crosswalk underscores that these signals might not be heeded or seen, adding unpredictability to the situation.\n\nLastly, yellow and black temporary barriers are noted lining the median that separates the opposing lanes of traffic. These barriers are critical as they limit the possibilities for making left turns or crossing the median, shaping the possible maneuvers the ego car can undertake.\n\nThis mix of vehicles, vulnerable road users, and controlled measures such as traffic lights and barriers presents a complex scenario that the ego car must navigate, highlighting the diverse considerations involved in autonomous driving decision-making."

It is also known as a 'bollard'. In this driving scenario, the presence of the bollard suggests that it may be protecting a pedestrian crossing or restricting vehicular access to a particular part of the road for safety reasons. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the bollard and stay within the appropriate driving lanes to ensure safety and compliance with traffic laws.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe speed and be prepared to brake for the dog on the crosswalk. Due to the barriers, it should not attempt to swerve into the opposite lane to avoid the dog but should rather slow down cautiously, alerting the vehicle behind with brake lights early. It is also important to be cautious of the vehicle ahead on the right, as it may make sudden movements in response to the dog. Continuously assess the dog's movement and proceed with caution while obeying the traffic light if the path is clear. Use of hazard lights might be considered to warn other drivers of the potential hazard ahead."
