A sedan is moving from right to left, with its rear slightly extending into the traffic lane. This requires careful maneuvering to avoid a collision.\n3. An orange car is parked on the left side of the road, facing the same direction as our vehicle. Although not posing a direct danger, its presence indicates a densely populated area where unexpected pedestrian activity may occur.\n\nAdditionally, a road construction sign illuminated by the vehicle's headlights is located in the middle of the road ahead. This sign warns of a road construction area that may involve lane restrictions or detours. \n\nTwo traffic cones are placed around the road construction sign, marking the area where vehicles are not allowed to enter. These cones guide vehicles around obstacles or work areas.\n\nFinally, there are metal barriers on both sides of the road, particularly noticeable on the right side. These barriers limit the road space and reduce the maneuverability of our vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should decelerate due to parked vehicles and obstacles from restricted areas or potential construction sites, prepare to comply with the mandatory directions indicated by traffic signs, ensure safe maneuvering around parked vehicles, and follow detour routes. The vehicle should also be vigilant for any road workers or additional signs indicating a detour or specific direction. Nighttime visibility reduction necessitates increased alertness, and readiness to take detour routes as indicated by traffic signs. Furthermore, be prepared to change lanes if it is safe to do so, and consider other potential hidden obstacles or road users.",
