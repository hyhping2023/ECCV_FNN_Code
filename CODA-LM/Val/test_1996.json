There are two vehicles described: first, a blue car to the left of the ego vehicle that is moving in the same direction; it may engage in unpredictable maneuvers. Additionally, there is a yellow mobile crane on the right side of the road ahead, indicating possible roadworks or obstructions. A second vehicle approaches from the opposite direction on the other side of the road; although it doesn't immediately threaten, vigilance is required to anticipate potential hazards from the opposite traffic.\n\nRegarding traffic management installations, orange traffic cones are arranged in a line on the right side of the road up to the construction crane, signaling a lane closure or construction work and suggesting cautious driving due to the reduction in lane width. Temporary road barriers are also placed along the right road edge, delineating the construction area and making it clear that this part of the road is not available for driving.\n\nAn additional object is the large yellow mobile crane situated on the right side of the road with its boom extended overhead, active in construction work. This crane poses a temporary obstacle which might necessitate vehicles to decelerate and remain alert for construction workers and any adjustments in traffic flow.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights described in this scene."
