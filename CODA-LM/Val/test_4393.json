        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that influence the driving behavior of the ego car, though no vehicles or vulnerable road users are present.\n\nFirstly, the traffic signs play a crucial role in guiding the ego car's actions. An overhead gantry displays a large orange sign indicating roadwork ahead, a detour for cars, and a roundabout, with smaller signs on the right side indicating a roundabout ahead and a speed limit of 30 km/h. These signs warn the ego car of changes in usual traffic patterns due to roadwork, indicating a reduced speed limit and the presence of a roundabout, necessitating a decrease in speed and potential lane changes to follow the detour. Additionally, a roadwork sign on the right of the road signals construction ahead, advising the ego car to expect potential obstacles or changes in road conditions. Furthermore, a blue circular sign with a white arrow points upwards, indicating a mandatory direction of travel straight ahead, requiring the ego car to continue moving straight as directed.\n\nTraffic cones are also present, with orange and white cones arranged in a line diagonally across the lanes, converging towards the right and leading traffic to merge into the remaining open lane. These cones guide vehicles away from a section of the road likely undergoing maintenance or construction, necessitating the ego car to merge to the right.\n\nBright orange barriers are lined up beside the traffic cones, indicating a closed lane or hazard zone on the right. These barriers visually reinforce the lane closure and help guide the ego car to the appropriate open lane.\n\nNo other objects, traffic lights, vehicles, or vulnerable road users are noted in the image, focusing the ego car's attention on navigating the indicated roadwork, obeying the traffic signs, and safely merging as directed by the traffic cones and barriers."

The symbol at the top depicts a round object with eight black lines radiating outward, which suggests a warning about a roundabout ahead. Below it is a symbol that resembles an arrow curving in a clockwise direction, indicating that vehicles should prepare to navigate a circular intersection. The text advises a maximum speed limit of 30, which means drivers should reduce their speed to 30 km/h as they approach and enter the roundabout for safety.",

The driver should be mindful of any workers or equipment in the roadwork area and also prepare to merge left due to other potential lane closures as guided by the barriers and traffic cones, while safely navigating the mandatory direction straight ahead as indicated."
