The size and position of this truck may obscure the driver's view of the road ahead, and the extended mixer chute could pose a hazard to nearby vehicles.\n  - A sedan is on the left side of the cement truck, visible through the framework of the mixer. Its close proximity to the cement truck with the extended chute could be a potential safety concern in case the sedan decides to change lanes or if the chute swings unpredictably.\n  - Multiple vehicles are present in the opposing lanes to the left, including a black sedan in the foreground and others in the distance. These vehicles in opposing traffic are not immediate concerns but should be monitored in case of any abrupt lane changes or unexpected maneuvers.\n  - Cars in adjacent lanes to the left are visible through the windshield of the ego vehicle. They might change lanes or influence the traffic flow, thereby affecting the maneuvering options for the ego vehicle.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A motorcyclist is visible on the far right, riding parallel to the ego vehicle in an adjacent lane. This motorcyclist may change lanes or vary speed, needing careful observation by the ego car for any sudden movements.\n  - Pedestrians are on the sidewalks and crossing the road in the background, not interfering with the immediate path of the ego car. These pedestrians are far enough to not impact the current driving decision but should be tracked in case they enter the roadway.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - There is a red traffic light for the lane the ego car and the cement truck are in. The red light indicates that the ego vehicle must stop and wait until it turns green before proceeding.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - White traffic barriers are on the right side of the road, separating the road from the walkway. These barriers define the boundary of the roadway and the protected pedestrian area, which may affect the available driving space for the ego vehicle.\n  - White fencing barriers are on the right side of the intersection, separating the road from construction or restricted areas. They delineate the road boundaries and restrict the ego vehicle from entering prohibited areas."

Lastly, the ego car should keep within lane boundaries, considering the barriers, and be prepared for any changes in the scenario such as the light turning green or movements from the truck or other vehicles."
