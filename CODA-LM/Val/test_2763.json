        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, our attention is drawn to a large truck directly in front of the ego car, equipped with a cement mixer. It occupies the central lane, traveling in the same heading as the ego car. The presence of this truck is significant because its size and position could potentially obstruct the ego car's view of the road ahead. Additionally, there is a risk associated with sudden braking by the truck or the possibility of debris falling from it, which the ego car must be prepared to react to.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side of the road, there are various cars parked in alignment with the curb. The ego car needs to navigate carefully, giving special attention to these parked vehicles. They constrict the drivable space and pose a risk that car doors may open suddenly or pedestrians may unexpectedly step out from between the parked cars.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the right of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. While the pedestrian is not on the road, their proximity to it suggests a potential hazard. The ego car must remain alert to the possibility of the pedestrian stepping onto the road, which could require immediate action.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are indicated in the image; hence they are not a concern in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "A large heavy-duty truck equipped with a concrete mixer, identified by its rotating drum, is in motion on the road. Such a vehicle is typically used for construction purposes, transporting freshly mixed concrete to a worksite. For the ego car, it's essential to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle, as construction vehicles can make sudden stops or slow down to maneuver around a worksite. Also, the depth perception of objects around these large vehicles can be challenging, due to their size obstructing view. Caution should be taken as debris may occasionally fall from such trucks.",

Be prepared to slow down or stop if visibility ahead is compromised. Watch for any potential risks emerging from the right side of the road where the parked vehicles are, such as opening doors or pedestrians. Do not attempt to overtake the truck without a clear and safe opportunity to do so. Continue monitoring the environment for any additional road users or changes that may affect driving decisions. Keep a watchful eye on the pedestrian to anticipate potential street-crossing, and drive at a speed that allows for safe reaction to any road users unexpectedly entering the road."
