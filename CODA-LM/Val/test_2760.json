Firstly, there is a white car positioned on the right side of the road, facing towards us and located in front of our vehicle. The presence of this vehicle in the adjacent lane may affect the flow of traffic or potentially enter the driving path of our vehicle, requiring careful attention.\n\nAdditionally, there are several cars driving in the opposite direction at varying distances across the road. While these vehicles are not currently affecting the direct path of our car, it is essential to monitor their movements in case they exhibit any abnormal behavior or pose a potential risk of entering our car's lane.\n\nFurthermore, construction obstacles are visible on the right side of the road, with crane operations underway. The presence of construction work may imply potential lane closures or changes in traffic patterns, which necessitates that self-driving cars be prepared for altered driving conditions.\n\nLastly, there is a large crane operating behind the obstacle on the right. Although the crane is not on the road, the activities related to it may cause distractions or sudden obstacles, which could impact driving safety.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones."
