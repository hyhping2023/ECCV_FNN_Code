Care must be taken when the brake lights come on, as it affects the speed at which the vehicle can safely travel and may require a complete stop."

Bright lights and reflective materials suggest there might be road construction or emergency vehicles ahead, which could indicate an accident or unexpected activity on or near the road.",
                "explanation": "Although the tree does not pose a direct threat to the vehicle itself, its proximity to the road may obscure potential hazards that could suddenly emerge from the obscured areas. Such lighting conditions may distract the driver or cause glare. The vehicle should drive cautiously, always ready to respond to sudden movements from workers or other vehicles."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, several road user categories are worth noting for autonomous driving systems. Firstly, there are multiple vehicles ahead with their lights on, and brake lights are visible, indicating slow traffic or potential congestion. The autonomous vehicle should, therefore, maintain a safe distance from these vehicles and be prepared to adjust speed or come to a stop as needed, based on the slowdown signaled by the activated brake lights.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is observed emitting a bright glow suggestive of a green signal. A further traffic light, emitting a blue-green hue, is visible through tree branches on the right side ahead. The autonomous driving system should ascertain the signal color accurately to proceed through the intersection safely when conditions are confirmed to be green and clear of any road obstructions or hazards.\n\nAn obstruction is detected directly ahead and to the right, identified by red and white reflective barriers indicating a potential construction zone or a road closure. The vehicle should navigate these barriers safely, recognizing them as signs to either halt or seek alternative pathways to avoid a collision or entering a closed or obstructed road area.\n\nTo the right side of the road, a large tree poses a visual obstruction, making it challenging to fully assess the road ahead. The presence of bright lights and reflective materials near this tree hints at possible road construction or emergency vehicles in the vicinity, possibly marking an accident site or an area of unexpected road activity. While the tree itself is not a direct hazard, its presence may hide emergent risks such as construction workers or sudden vehicle movements. Thus, the autonomous vehicle is advised to proceed with heightened caution, ready to respond promptly to any unforeseen hazards that may emerge from the areas obscured by the tree."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, maintain a safe distance from the car in front, and always be prepared for changes in traffic signals. Pay attention to your surroundings, especially limited visibility or sudden obstacles that may be caused by trees. Be cautious of potential changes in road conditions due to nearby metal barriers and traffic cones indicating construction or closed areas. The vehicle should slow down and be ready to change lanes if necessary, while also being mindful of any road workers or emergency services personnel that may be present.",
