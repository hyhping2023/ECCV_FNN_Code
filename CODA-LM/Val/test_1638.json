        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects of interest. The first is a yellow construction vehicle, resembling a wheel loader or bulldozer, that is located in the right lane and is moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this construction vehicle is critical because it may travel at a slower pace than the rest of the traffic or may execute sudden stops or turns due to construction activities. It is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for any unexpected maneuvers from the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there are two pedestrians. One pedestrian is dressed in dark clothing and is walking on the right edge of the road and is facing oncoming traffic. The proximity of this pedestrian to the roadway poses a safety risk, as they may accidentally enter the road. On the left side of the road, there is another pedestrian walking parallel to the direction of travel and away from the ego car. Although this pedestrian is not an immediate hazard, they should be continuously observed in case they decide to cross the road or change their walking path.\n\nThe image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would impact the driving decisions or behavior of the ego car."

This vehicle is typically used for construction work and is capable of carrying large amounts of materials such as dirt, sand, or gravel. The presence of this vehicle on the road suggests that there may be construction work ahead or nearby. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this large vehicle, as it may make unpredictable movements, and visibility around it can be limited due to its size. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for possible debris on the road and be watchful for signage or signals indicating construction zones, which may require reduced speeds and increased caution.",

Additionally, the ego car may need to prepare for a lane change if the construction activity affects the current lane. The presence of the pedestrian should alert the driver to be cautious and ready to stop if necessary. Continuous monitoring of the pedestrian's movement is advised to respond to any unpredictable behaviour. The ego car should also keep a watchful eye on the pedestrian on the left, although they do not currently present a direct hazard."
