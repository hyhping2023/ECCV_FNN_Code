Additionally, several cars are visible ahead in the same lane, all showing red tail lights, which suggests that the traffic is slow-moving or congested. The ego car should be ready for potential stop-and-go traffic and remain vigilant.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a pedestrian in front of a parked car, facing away from the ego car, who appears to be crossing the street or possibly entering or exiting the parked car. The ego car must be cautious, ready to yield, and ensure the pedestrian's safety as their actions could affect the flow of traffic.\n\nTo the right of the road, there is an object that could be an informal street vendor set up. It is unclear whether it interferes with the roadway, but if it extends into the road, it could be a hazard or obstruction. The ego car may need to change lanes or reduce speed to avoid it.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
