These trucks can limit visibility and maneuverability for the ego car, necessitating caution and potentially a reduced speed to navigate safely.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, on the right side of the road, there is a green sanitation truck with orange-vested workers alongside it. The truck appears to be stopped, and the presence of workers indicates that there may be an obstructed road ahead or slow-moving traffic, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution.\n\nAdditionally, a variety of vehicles, including a blue car and a darker vehicle, are parked or stationed to the right side of the road. These vehicles are stationary and may require the ego car to navigate around them, especially if there are any sudden movements.\n\nSedans and smaller vehicles on the right side of the road, similar to those on the left, also appear to be parked or moving slowly. This suggests congested or slow-moving traffic, and the ego car must navigate the scene carefully while maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene include workers wearing high-visibility vests present in the left lane, interacting with the trucks. These workers can move unpredictably and increase the risk of an incident, which the ego car must anticipate and account for.\n\nA pedestrian is also present slightly to the right of the center of the road, walking away from the ego car and facing the oncoming traffic. This pedestrian is a potential hazard as they might change direction or cross the road, requiring the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary.\n\nThere are workers wearing high-visibility vests by the sanitation truck on the right, with one in motion crossing the road. Their presence, especially those moving across the road, heightens the risk of pedestrian-related obstructions.\n\nLastly, there is a pedestrian on the sidewalk, far right, who does not appear to impact the traffic flow. While this pedestrian does not seem to require immediate consideration from the ego car, they should be monitored in case they decide to cross the street unexpectedly.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that need to be considered in this summary."

It should also prepare to change lanes if the rightmost lane is too obstructed by the partially parked truck and to avoid the road users. Moreover, maintaining a higher level of caution due to the wet road conditions will be vital for safe navigation through this scene. Continuous monitoring of the situation for any unexpected changes, such as workers moving equipment or other vehicles cutting in, is advised. Additionally, while the pedestrian on the right is currently not a concern, they should be observed in case their actions influence traffic."
