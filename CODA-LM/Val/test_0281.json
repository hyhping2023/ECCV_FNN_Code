It does not immediately pose a direct threat because of the distance and its direction of travel, but attention should be paid in case it stops or makes any lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, the image shows several workers on a sidewalk to the right, with safety railings behind them. Although they are not on the roadway, their close proximity to the roadside suggests that drivers should remain cautious and prepared for any potential sudden movements.\n\nA cyclist is also present, riding on the right side of the road, moving parallel to and away from our vehicle. It's essential for the ego vehicle to keep an eye on the cyclist in the event of any directional changes or obstacles they might encounter.\n\nVisible on the right is a construction sign, which alerts drivers to upcoming roadwork. This sign indicates that drivers should be ready for potential traffic pattern changes, such as lane closures or detours, and the autonomous vehicle should thus proceed with increased caution.\n\nOn the left side of the road, traffic cones have been placed, signifying either construction ahead or a road closure. These cones serve as markers to indicate alterations to road conditions like lane closures or construction zones, necessitating an adjustment in the ego vehicle's lane position or speed.\n\nTemporary construction barriers are erected on the right side of the road, enclosing the construction area. These barriers likely define the boundary between the construction area and the active road, advising self-driving vehicles to drive with caution and possibly merge left if the right lane is blocked.\n\nThe traffic lights and other objects categories do not contain any items, which indicates that there are no such objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a cautious speed, be aware of potential instructions from construction signs on the left, and be prepared for possible lane changes or reductions due to visible traffic cones and construction obstacles. It is also important to continuously observe the white sedan ahead to appropriately respond to any potential changes in its behavior. Maintaining a safe distance from sidewalk workers and monitoring cyclists is also prudent. Vigilance must be maintained until the vehicle has passed through the construction area and all relevant road users and signs.",
