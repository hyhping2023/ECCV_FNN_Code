    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, observe the lane changing conditions of other vehicles in the surrounding lanes, and be prepared to stop for the red light ahead. Pay attention to the red-and-white striped obstacles on the left, which may indicate changes in lane availability. Keep an eye on the traffic conditions around the black vehicle on your right and be ready to respond to vehicles merging from the right. On rainy days, the roads are slippery, so drive carefully to avoid hydroplaning, and pay attention to any red circular signs that may indicate driving restrictions.",

An ego car should take note of this barrier and maintain its lane, avoiding any maneuvers that could potentially bring the vehicle too close to the barrier to prevent scraping or collision.",

The future driving behavior of the ego car should be to maintain a safe distance from the barrier and stay within the designated traffic lanes.",
