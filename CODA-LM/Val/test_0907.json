Its size and the equipment it is carrying may limit its maneuverability and speed, potentially causing slowing traffic or sudden stops. A silver minivan is in the left lane adjacent to the ego car, and due to its proximity, the ego car should be cautious if considering a lane change. The road is busy with several cars in various lanes around the ego vehicle, including a black sedan directly ahead in the neighboring right lane, indicating that the movements of these vehicles may impact the ego car's ability to change lanes or adjust speed. Additionally, there is a white van on the left lane ahead of the ego car, which may make sudden moves that the ego car needs to be prepared for.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image.\n\nThe traffic signs include signage on top of the toll booth indicating lane usage, which helps the driver identify which lane to use for paying tolls and can influence lane choice as the ego car approaches the booth. A traffic light visible ahead is currently red, requiring the ego car to stop at the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nOther objects in the scene include a toll booth up ahead, which is a point where vehicles may slow down or stop to make a payment, affecting the flow of traffic."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large, industrial construction vehicle equipped with an articulated hydraulic arm commonly used in civil engineering and roadwork projects. It features visible mechanical components and possibly an attachment like a bucket or drill. Due to its size and the complexity of its equipment, this vehicle may move more slowly and have limited maneuverability. The future driving behavior of the car from whose viewpoint the image is taken, often referred to as the ego car, would involve maintaining a safe following distance from this construction vehicle. The driver should be cautious and ready to adapt to any sudden stops or movements that this large vehicle might make, especially in an urban traffic environment where abrupt maneuvers by construction vehicles can be more common.",

Caution should be exercised when considering a lane change, ensuring it is done safely and without interfering with the adjacent minivan and other nearby vehicles. Finally, the ego car must come to a complete stop at the red light ahead and wait for it to change to green before proceeding. Additionally, the ego car should prepare to navigate the toll booth, choosing the correct lane in advance as indicated by the signage."
