These cones imply potential hazards or lane narrowing, thus the ego car must proceed with caution and may need to change lanes.\n\nOther objects include a dustbin and a road sign indicating a turn or intersection ahead, both positioned next to the sidewalk on the right side of the road. These objects should be noted for potential pedestrian activity or directional changes ahead. Additionally, a small road sign next to the traffic cones indicates possible road work or lane closure, reinforcing the need for caution."
