On the right side of the road at the edge, there is a large yellow construction vehicle that is stationary. Its size and positioning could make the road space tighter and potentially obscure visibility for the driver. Alongside this, there are several vehicles parked on the right, including white vans and cars, which pose a hazard if any were to enter the road suddenly. Additionally, a motorcycle is parked with these vehicles, which, due to its smaller size, might be less visible and could be a hazard if the rider were to merge into traffic without notice.\n\nOn the left side, there is a blue truck with a visible flatbed, also stationary. While it isn't currently obstructing the lane, drivers should remain alert in the event it starts to move.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights reported in this particular scene, one must take note of a blue construction barrier positioned along the right edge of the road. The barrier partly blocks off an area, likely indicating ongoing roadwork or an obstruction, and warrants caution when driving by.\n\nLastly, it is mentioned that there are no traffic cones visible; this signifies that there are no immediate alterations to the traffic lanes due to construction activities, allowing traffic to maintain its regular pattern without adjustments for construction zones. There are also no other miscellaneous objects reported in the scene."
