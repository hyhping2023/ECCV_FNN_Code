The presence of a slow-moving or potentially stopping construction vehicle in the same lane affects the ego vehicle's speed and following distance, necessitating increased caution and preparedness for sudden stops."

This heavy-duty truck is clearly for construction or maintenance work, identifiable by the machinery on the back and the safety chevron markings. The key consideration for the ego vehicle is to prepare to slow down or stop to keep a safe following distance, as the construction vehicle imposes a need for increased caution and awareness of potential sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional traffic sign to the right side of the road, just past the intersection, that is partially obstructed by foliage. Despite the obstruction, the ego car must be mindful of any crucial information it could provide, such as upcoming lane closures or detour routes, which would require the vehicle to adapt its course accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic lights for the lane that includes both the construction vehicle and the ego car show green, which typically would signal that it's safe to proceed. However, due to the construction vehicle's presence and its potential to slow down or stop, the ego car should proceed with caution despite having the right of way to move through the intersection. \n\nThere are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects identified in the traffic image."
