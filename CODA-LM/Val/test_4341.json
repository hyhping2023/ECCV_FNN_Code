This vehicle might decelerate or block the left lane, necessitating a speed adjustment or lane change.\n- Several cars are distributed across the right and middle lanes, driving in the same direction as our vehicle. Our vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or unexpected maneuvers by the leading vehicles.\n- A white vehicle is in the far right lane ahead of our vehicle with its right turn signal on, indicating it is making a right turn. This vehicle may slow down or stop unexpectedly, requiring close monitoring and possible speed adjustments.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n- Overhead signs display upcoming exits and lane directions. These signs assist the autonomous vehicle in preparing for necessary lane changes on a predetermined route.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n- A series of pink traffic cones separate the road from the pedestrian area on the left side. These cones likely indicate road construction or lane narrowing areas that vehicles should avoid.\n\n**Barriers:**\n- Decorative railings or fences are installed alongside the sidewalk, separating pedestrians from the street. These barriers indicate potential pedestrian activity areas, requiring the vehicle to stay vigilant.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n- Trees and shrubs are lined up beside the sidewalk without encroaching onto the road. While they do not directly affect driving, they should be monitored for falling debris or reduced visibility.\n\nThis detailed analysis helps in understanding the current road conditions and assists the autonomous vehicle in making safe driving decisions."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should continue in the current lane while adjusting speed to maintain a safe following distance with the car ahead. Be aware of any signs of behavioral changes in the yellow vehicle to the left, which may affect lane usage. Prepare for any potential lane changes ahead by observing overhead signs, and merge into the appropriate lane when necessary, according to the planned route. Stay alert to pedestrians that might appear near obstacles or fences. Keep a safe distance from the car in front. Be vigilant about vehicles parked on the right, in case they unexpectedly move or pedestrians emerge around them. Prepare for any necessary lane changes or turns at the upcoming intersection as indicated by overhead directional signs. Continue to monitor the traffic flow, ready to adjust speed or position according to the traffic conditions up ahead. Maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead, and be prepared for stops or slowdowns caused by vehicles turning right. The vehicle should heed the lane guidance provided by the overhead signs, ensuring the correct route is followed and, if necessary, safely change lanes ahead of reaching an intersection or fork in the road.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads to guide traffic by temporarily redirecting vehicles away from certain areas. It usually serves as a warning of road work ahead, potential hazards, or to demarcate pedestrian areas. The presence of this traffic cone would indicate that the ego car may need to adjust its course to avoid the marked area, potentially merging or shifting lanes if the cones indicate a closure of the current lane.",
