        "description and explanation": "The image shows a variety of road users and objects. There are three vehicles in the vicinity of the ego car. A cement mixer truck is directly ahead in the same lane, slightly off-center to the right. The truck's large size and its position in the same lane as the ego car influence the driving behavior, as the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and prepare for any sudden stops or turns the truck may make. A blue bus is to the left across the intersection, facing towards the ego vehicle's direction but in the opposite lane. Its presence suggests the need for the ego car to ensure that the bus's turning path is not obstructed and that there is a safe distance maintained to prevent any collisions. A black sedan is on the right lane next to the ego car. The sedan is in close proximity, which means the ego car must be aware of it to avoid any potential lane merging conflicts or side collisions.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there is a cyclist crossing the road from left to right at the intersection. The cyclist directly influences the ego vehicle's behavior because it may need to slow down or stop to allow the cyclist to cross safely.\n\nThe traffic lights at the intersection are green, indicating the ego car has the right-of-way to proceed. This indicates that it is legal for the ego car to proceed through the intersection, assuming it is safe to do so with respect to other road users.\n\nThere are also yellow temporary barriers placed to the right side of the road, marking the boundary of the construction zone or road works. This means the ego car should be cautious of potential roadwork and be prepared for unexpected movements by construction vehicles or workers entering the roadway. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

The ego vehicle must yield to the cyclist crossing the road and proceed with caution through the intersection, considering the green traffic light. Always be aware of the temporary barriers indicating potential road work and be ready for any necessary lane changes or speed adjustments. Monitoring the adjacent lanes for other vehicles like the bus and the sedan is also crucial for safe maneuvering through the intersection."
