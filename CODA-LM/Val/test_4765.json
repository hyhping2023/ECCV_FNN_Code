Its presence in the driving area may suggest it has fallen off a vehicle or is discarded, presenting a potential road hazard. The ego car should reduce its speed and navigate carefully to avoid the tire.

The presence of such debris could indicate poor road maintenance or active road work, suggesting the need for the ego car to maintain vigilance and possibly reduce speed to safely navigate unexpected obstacles.",

Since there are no visible vulnerable road users or traffic control devices directly affecting the ego car's path, the main focus should be on maintaining a moderate speed that will allow for safe passage through the area with the parked vehicles and potential road hazards."
