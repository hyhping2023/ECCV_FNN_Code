The ego car must be ready to either pass the bus safely if the adjacent lane is clear or slow down if the bus starts moving.\n\nOn the right side, next to a construction area, there is a utility vehicle parked facing the opposite direction of traffic. This vehicle is stationary and partly on the footpath, indicating a work zone that may cause obstructions or the presence of workers near the road.\n\nMultiple pedestrians are observed on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, near the construction area. The proximity of pedestrians to the road, especially near a work zone, requires the ego car to exercise increased caution in case someone steps onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nThere are blue circular traffic signs with white arrows on the right side of the road, indicating that a right turn is mandatory at the intersection ahead. The ego car must comply with this instruction.\n\nTraffic cones are placed along the edge of the road, starting from the ego car's position and extending towards the construction site. These cones are marking the construction work and reducing the lane width, signaling that the ego car should slow down and be ready to maneuver or stop if necessary.\n\nWooden barriers and caution tape are set up around the construction work on the right side of the road, serving as a warning for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance from the potential hazards of the work zone.\n\nAdditionally, garbage collection bins are lined up on the right side behind the traffic cones. These bins could block the ego vehicle's path or hide pedestrians, necessitating caution when passing by. There is also a ladder against a tree on the right sidewalk, indicating potential overhead work. This could lead to distractions or falling debris, so the ego car should stay alert and maintain a safe distance from the work area.\n\nThe traffic lights category is empty, indicating there are no traffic lights affecting the ego vehicle's behavior in the image."
