Directly ahead of the ego vehicle, within the same lane, there is a cement mixer truck, which could be reducing speed or preparing to stop, as signaled by its activated rear lights. The considerable size of the truck and its potential to halt necessitate that the ego car maintain a sufficient following distance and stay alert for any sudden changes in speed.\n\nAdditionally, the right lane clusters a number of cars with their rear lights lit, signifying that the flow of traffic is active, albeit with a possibility of coming to a slowdown or a complete stop imminently. These vehicles necessitate careful consideration by the ego car when evaluating a potential lane change, as they can impact the lateral movement options.\n\nTo one side of the road, adjacent to the intersection ahead, there's a yield sign. The placement of this traffic sign prompts the ego car to be cautious and ready to yield the right-of-way to any incoming vehicles or pedestrians which may intersect its trajectory.\n\nLastly, durable barricades are set up to divide the opposite directions of traffic, guiding the flow and firmly eliminating the option for the ego car to cross into oncoming lanes for overtaking purposes."

The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the construction vehicle to make sudden stops or turns, especially if it's entering a construction area.

Prepare to yield as per the yield sign and be cautious of any potential oncoming traffic or crossing pedestrians. Stay vigilant for any changes in the behavior of the vehicles in the right lane, and be cautious with maneuvers due to the wet road conditions. No lane changes should be made across the permanent barriers. Monitor the rearview and side mirrors to assess the traffic flow and make any necessary speed adjustments while considering the reduced braking capability on the wet road surface."
