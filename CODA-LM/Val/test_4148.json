Additionally, an electronic road sign is located on the right side, just before a closed gate, displaying a red circle with a white line that indicates a prohibition of entry or no access. This sign signifies that the ego car cannot proceed beyond the gate and must either wait or find an alternative route.\n\nFurthermore, there is a red traffic light visible above a boom barrier directly in the lane of the ego car. The red light indicates that the ego car must stop and wait until the light turns green before proceeding. Complementing the traffic light, there is a boom barrier in the downward position blocking the lane of the ego car, indicating that the path ahead is currently closed to vehicular traffic, and the ego car will need to wait for the barrier to be raised before continuing.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
