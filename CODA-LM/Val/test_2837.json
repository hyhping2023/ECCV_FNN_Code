The presence of these parked cars constrains the width of the usable driving lane, necessitating cautious driving to avoid potential obstacles or car doors opening.\n   - Several moving vehicles are ahead, maintaining a flow of traffic. These vehicles regulate the speed of the ego car and necessitate maintaining a safe following distance.\n   - A motorbike is moving ahead in the same direction as the ego car, situated on the left edge of the lane to the front-right of the ego car. This motorbike's presence and its proximity could influence the ego car's speed and lane positioning.\n   - One car is traveling on the left side of the ego vehicle, in the same direction. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the leading car's potential speed changes or stops.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A cyclist is riding on the right side of the road, in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist is directly in the path of the ego car and could change speed or direction, requiring the ego car to be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary to maintain safety.\n   - One pedestrian is walking on the right sidewalk, parallel to the road. This pedestrian is not directly in the ego car's path but should be monitored in case they decide to cross the road.\n   - A motorcyclist is visible ahead on the right, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car should keep a safe distance and be attentive to the motorcyclist's actions, as motorcycles can change speed or lane position more unpredictably than larger vehicles."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone typically serves as a warning for temporary situations. It is bright orange with a white reflective stripe, making it highly visible. Placed on the road, it may indicate the presence of road work, a hazard, or a change in traffic patterns ahead. The cone influences the driving behavior by signaling to the driver of the ego car to remain vigilant, reduce speed if necessary, and prepare to possibly change lanes or maneuver around the obstacle, while respecting the safety of road workers and other road users.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a cautious speed to ensure a safe stopping distance from the vehicles ahead. Be vigilant for the movements of the cyclist and prepare to either slow down or change lanes safely if the cyclist's actions require it. Since there is on-street parking, be mindful of any pedestrians that may potentially step out from between parked cars or cars that may pull out into traffic. Always ensure there is enough clearance when passing the cyclist, providing at least one meter of space as per many local traffic laws. Continue to monitor the road ahead for any new road users or changes in traffic conditions. Due to the presence of parked vehicles occupying the right lane, the ego car should maintain a left-lane position while passing the parked vehicles, ensuring not to come too close to the motorbike ahead. Continue to monitor the pedestrian on the right sidewalk for any signs of intent to cross the road. Proceed with caution and at a speed appropriate for the road conditions and traffic environment. Given the current scene, the ego car should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe following distance from the car ahead on the left and also being mindful of the motorcyclist who is further down the road to the right. It should be ready to react if the motorcyclist changes lanes or if any of the parked cars on the right side initiate movement. It is also essential to keep an eye out for any traffic signs or changes not currently visible in the scene."
