        "description and explanation": "A large truck is positioned ahead in the same lane as the ego car with its brake lights illuminated, suggesting it is either slowing down or stopped. This indicates the ego car may need to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, an oncoming vehicle with headlights on is approaching from the opposite direction on the other side of the road. While this does not immediately affect the ego car, it signals the presence of traffic and the necessity for caution, especially for any intended maneuvers across the road.\n\nA traffic light is visible in the distance displaying red on the leftmost signal and green on the farther right signal, which suggests a phase change or lane-specific signals. The ego car should be prepared to stop if the red light applies to its lane or closely monitor the lights for changes relevant to its movement.\n\nThere are also reflective markers or lights on the right side of the road, possibly indicating road work or barriers ahead. These markers suggest the need for caution and readiness for potential changes in traffic patterns."

The presence of this type of vehicle suggests active or upcoming road work, which may impact traffic flow. It is likely to be moving slowly or may be stationary while conducting roadwork. The ego car should maintain a safe distance, reduce speed, and be prepared for potential stoppages or diversions as a result of the vehicle's operations.",

Monitor the truck's indicators in case it intends to turn, and watch for other road users that might not be immediately visible."
