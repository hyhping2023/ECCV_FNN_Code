The first forklift is facing the direction of the ego vehicle, while the second one is positioned to its right with its side facing the ego car. These forklifts, though stationary, are positioned close to the lane and might potentially move or enter the roadway unexpectedly, especially considering their proximity to the pedestrian crossing.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**: A speed limit sign indicating '30' is visible next to the traffic lights on the right side of the image. This sign dictates the maximum speed that the ego car is allowed to travel on this section of the road for legal and safety reasons.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**: A green arrow pointing left indicates that the ego car can proceed with a left turn, while an adjacent red light mandates that through traffic must stop. The ego car should prepare for a left turn if intended, while also adhering to the red light for the through lane by stopping until it turns green.\n\n4. **Barriers**: Red and white vertical traffic posts are placed on the median strip to denote the separation between opposite lanes of traffic. These barriers indicate that the car should maintain lane discipline and not cross the median strip."

Additionally, be cautious of the fact that pedestrians are not allowed to cross currently but observe for any that might enter the crossing against the signal.

Ensure that lane discipline is maintained and prepare to react to any dynamic changes in the scene ahead."
