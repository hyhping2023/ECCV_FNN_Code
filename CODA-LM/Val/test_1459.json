It is bright orange with a reflective stripe and is illuminated by the headlights of the ego car. The presence of the traffic cone suggests there may be a potential hazard or a construction zone ahead. It serves as a guide for vehicles to stay away from the edge of the right lane. Consequently, the ego car should take caution by either slowing down or changing lanes if it is safe to proceed in that manner. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is often used to direct traffic by designating lanes and to caution drivers about hazards or construction zones. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone may indicate road work ahead or a closed-off area that the ego car should navigate around carefully. The ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to alter its course to avoid the obstacle while also paying attention to any additional signs or cones that might further define a safe path.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of the traffic cone and the potentially wet road conditions, the ego vehicle should reduce speed, maintain a safe distance from the cone, and be alert for possible road work or other hazards ahead. The ego car's headlights should be on, and the driver should be prepared to adjust the vehicle's path to stay within the driveable lane while passing the cone safely. The lack of other visible road users in this image doesn't require immediate reactive maneuvers, but constant vigilance is necessary in such conditions to respond to dynamic changes."
