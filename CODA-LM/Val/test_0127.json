        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several vehicles are noted on the road. There is a black SUV on the right-hand lane that could be stationary or moving; it poses potential hazards related to door openings or passengers disembarking, which may reduce the available road space for our vehicle. A green tour bus is approaching from the opposite direction on the left side, potentially obstructing the road view. Another vehicle is parked on the same side in a parking space, necessitating a slight diversion of our vehicle to the left for safe passage. Additionally, a black car is traveling ahead, followed by other vehicles, and our vehicle needs to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for sudden stops or turns.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene include pedestrians near the edge of the sidewalk on the right, necessitating vigilance as they might step onto the road. A cyclist is also sharing the road on the right side, moving in the same direction as traffic. This requires the driver to be vigilant about the shared road space. On the left sidewalk, pedestrians walking parallel to the self-driving vehicle also require attention should any of them enter the roadway.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a pedestrian crossing sign next to the sidewalk signaling areas of potential pedestrian crosswalks, which could lead to an increase in pedestrian activity and necessitates heightened caution and readiness to stop.\n\nOther elements in the scene include trees and street lamps aligned along the left sidewalk. While these do not directly affect driving behavior, they could obscure pedestrians, requiring additional focus from the vehicleâ€™s sensors and driver.\n\nThis image lacks any traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that would affect driving decisions or require additional maneuvers."

    "driving_suggestion": "Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe distance from the black SUV ahead, ready to respond to any pedestrians attempting to cross the street from the sidewalk, especially near pedestrian signs, and keep a safe distance from cyclists. Additionally, observe the behavior of the green tour bus to see if there are any signs of entering the traffic lane. Drive cautiously at a safe speed in mixed traffic environments. Stay alert to the dynamics of the green tour bus and cyclists. Be prepared to stop or yield where pedestrians cross the street, as indicated by signs. Autonomous vehicles should maintain a moderate speed to ensure there is enough distance to safely respond to the dynamics of motorcyclists and vehicles ahead. It is recommended to frequently check the rearview mirror to monitor the surrounding traffic situation. When overtaking vehicles parked on the roadside, slightly increase the lateral spacing, but do not deviate into the opposite lane. Pay close attention to pedestrians on both sides of the road to see if there are any signs of crossing.",
