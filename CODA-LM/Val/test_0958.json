This requires the ego vehicle to change lanes to avoid a collision, and the stopped van could indicate a temporary work zone or a vehicle breakdown.\n- A dark-colored hatchback is parked by the curb, narrowing the effective width of the road but not directly affecting the lane the ego vehicle is in. This could lead to misjudgment of available road space, and activities related to this parked car might unexpectedly influence traffic.\n- A black compact car is parked on the side of the road beyond the white van. While it does not impact the immediate path of the ego car, its presence should be noted in case the vehicle re-enters traffic or opens a door.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n- Two pedestrians are standing near traffic cones on the right side of the road. One pedestrian, wearing a yellow jacket, is gesturing, suggesting some kind of work or direction. Pedestrians close to the roadway can potentially enter the driving lane, requiring caution and readiness to stop. The presence of workers on the road mandates caution, lower speeds, and preparedness to stop or yield if necessary.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n- The traffic light is not visible in the image. This means the ego car must rely on other cues such as traffic cones, road markings, and the behavior of road workers for navigation decisions.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n- Multiple orange traffic cones are placed in a line, indicating a work zone or lane closure on the right side of the road. This indicates that the lane is partially or fully closed, necessitating a lane change for the ego car. The cones suggest lane narrowing or road work, requiring the ego car to merge left or prepare to stop if the lane is closed ahead."
