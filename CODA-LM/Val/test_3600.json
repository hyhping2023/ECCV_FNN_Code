It is often employed in construction zones, during road works, or as a means to guide traffic away from potential hazards. The traffic cone has a reflective surface to ensure visibility at night or in low-light conditions. As for the influence on the ego car's future driving behavior in this scenario, the driver should reduce speed and prepare to maneuver around the cone while staying within the designated traffic lane, ensuring safety and compliance with road regulations.",

The bright color and reflective material make it highly visible at night. In the context of driving, the presence of this cone suggests that there may be construction, an accident, or some other obstruction ahead on the roadway. The driver of the ego car should slow down and prepare to navigate around the cone, maintaining a safe distance from the hazard it indicates.",
