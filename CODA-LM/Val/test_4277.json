        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable vehicles. The first is a white hatchback car parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. This parked car poses a potential hazard as it reduces the drivable width of the lane and could obstruct visibility for any emerging hazards, such as opening doors or pedestrians appearing from in front or behind the vehicle. The fact that the car's headlights are on may indicate recent activity or the possibility that the car could begin moving, requiring the ego car to monitor it for any signs of movement closely.\n\nThe second vehicle is an oncoming vehicle with its headlights on, approaching directly ahead in the opposite lane. The headlights of this oncoming vehicle could cause temporary vision impairment for the driver of the ego car or its sensors. It is crucial to monitor the trajectory of the oncoming vehicle to ensure it remains within its lane. The bright headlights necessitate that the ego car reduces its speed and exercises increased caution to prevent glare and ensure safe passage.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, indicating that these categories do not present additional considerations for the ego car in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This appears to be an oncoming vehicle with its headlights on. The bright headlights suggest that the vehicle's lights are set to high beam, which can cause visibility issues for other drivers. The ego car should ensure its headlights are appropriately adjusted to prevent glare and maintain safe visibility. Furthermore, the ego car's driver should be prepared to adjust the vehicle's position within the lane or reduce speed if necessary to maintain a safe distance from the oncoming vehicle.",

Be prepared to stop or maneuver if a hazard presents itself, such as the parked car's door opening or pedestrians. Keep a careful watch on the oncoming vehicle to ensure it stays in its lane and does not pose a head-on collision risk. Increase distance from the parked car where possible to allow for a wider safety margin. Use low beam headlights to minimize glare for oncoming traffic and enhance your own visibility if not already on. Additionally, the ego vehicle should move slightly to the left within the lane, if possible and safe, to maintain a safe distance from the parked car on the right without crossing into the opposite lane of traffic."
