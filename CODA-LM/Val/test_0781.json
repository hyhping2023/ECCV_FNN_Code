        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is one significant element to note in relation to the autonomous driving context. A large truck is ahead in the same lane, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The truck is notably carrying a load of gravel or debris. The presence of this truck is crucial because its large size, coupled with the risk of debris falling off, directly influences our vehicle's potential speed and travel route choices. This scenario highlights the need for heightened awareness and possibly adjusted driving strategies to ensure safety and efficiency in navigation. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects show no elements present in this particular traffic image, thus do not require attention in this context."

Pay attention to the truck's signal lights, as it may be preparing to turn at the upcoming intersection indicated by the road signs.",

Given its size and nature, it may move more slowly and make wide turns. The ego car should maintain a safe distance when following, allowing for a larger stopping distance and being prepared for unexpected maneuvers such as sudden stops or turns typically associated with such vehicles.",
