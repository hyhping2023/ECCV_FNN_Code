        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image ahead, there's a large dump truck in the left lane with visible soil or debris in its cargo bed. The size and possible falling debris from this truck necessitate a wider safety distance from our vehicle. Additionally, a red truck occupies the same left lane, going in the same direction as us. Monitoring this truck is important; it influences lane selection and overtaking while also providing clues about traffic flow and speed regulation adherence. Furthermore, there is a flatbed truck ahead in the right lane which could potentially impact our vehicle's lane change decisions and the flow of traffic, since it is also moving in the same direction as our vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this viewed scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the dump truck ahead, while monitoring its cargo. If the dump truck's speed is significantly lower than your car's expected speed, be prepared to overtake, but only under safe and legal conditions. Try to stay in lanes where the traffic is smoother and be constantly vigilant for vehicles ahead and any unexpected road debris. In addition, based on the flatbed truck's movement in the right lane, be ready to adjust your speed or change lanes.",

The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates potential construction work nearby. The ego car should exercise caution, maintain a safe distance, and be prepared for the construction vehicle to make wide turns or stop suddenly to offload material.
