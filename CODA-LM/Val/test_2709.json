The presence and behavior of the van are important as they dictate the speed and following distance the ego car must maintain to ensure safe driving conditions. Additionally, orange traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, signaling that the driver should merge or shift lanes to the left. This indicates that there may be construction or maintenance work ahead, leading to a reduction in lane width or a change in the driving path. Alongside the cones, metal guardrails are visible on both sides of the road, and a temporary orange barrier is set up parallel to the cones, marking the boundaries of the drivable area and signaling the need for extra caution. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
