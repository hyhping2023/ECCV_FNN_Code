The truck's size and potential slower speed may require the ego car to change lanes or adjust speed to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, multiple vehicles are present in the opposite lanes of traffic, traveling perpendicular to the ego car's direction. While they do not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions, cross traffic should be monitored for safety, especially at intersections. Several cars are also visible in the far distance ahead on the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car, which will influence the ego car's speed and following distance. A blue car is stopped at the intersection in the opposite lane, facing the opposite direction, prompting the ego car to monitor oncoming traffic for safety and anticipate potential turns from opposing vehicles.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a speed limit sign on the right indicating a maximum of 50 km/h, informing the ego car of the legal speed limit to maintain a safe and legal speed. The traffic lights include one ahead displaying green for the direction the ego car is traveling, indicating the right of way to continue forward without stopping, and another set of traffic lights for the left turn lane showing red, implying no left turns are allowed at this moment, which means the ego car should not be in the left turn lane.\n\nLastly, there are some commercial store signs on the right, distant and not obstructing the road. These signs do not directly affect traffic but should be noted for environmental awareness. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is part of a large construction vehicle, possibly a mobile crane, heavy-duty truck, or concrete pump truck. It appears to be the boom arm section, which is commonly used for lifting heavy materials or equipment at construction sites. The proximity of this vehicle could influence the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring more cautious driving and possibly increased stopping distances. The driver will need to be aware of the potential for sudden stops or turns by the larger vehicle, and there is a chance that parts of the vehicle may extend into adjacent lanes, which necessitates extra vigilance and readiness to react.",

The ego vehicle must adhere to the 50 km/h speed limit. Additionally, as the ego car is approaching an intersection, attention should be paid to the traffic lights and cross traffic. Should the truck ahead behave erratically or slow down significantly, lane changing considerations should be based on the rear and side detection systems' feedback. Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck, adhere to the 50 km/h speed limit, and prepare to stop if the traffic lights change. Monitor oncoming traffic for safety."
