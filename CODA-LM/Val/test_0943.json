        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are multiple road users and relevant objects affecting driving behavior. Firstly, regarding vehicles, there is a white van on the left lane ahead, moving in the same direction as our vehicle, which may slow down, stop, or change lanes, potentially affecting the speed and lane choice of our vehicle. Additionally, an orange forklift is positioned on the right side of the road, moving parallel to our vehicle, representing a mobile hazard as its operation could unpredictably encroach upon our lane.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a blue circular sign with a white arrow and bicycle symbol that indicates a bike lane to the right, requiring drivers to be alert and watch out for cyclists, potentially giving way or avoiding the bicycle lanes. Another sign on the right side is a circular \"No Entry\" sign with red and white stripes on a white wall, signifying that our vehicle is not allowed to enter this area and should remain on the current road.\n\nBarriers are also present in the image. On the right, there are obstacles or fences surrounding a construction site or restricted area, limiting the driving area on the right and guiding the vehicle to stay in the current lane or move left if necessary. On the left, a metal traffic barrier is visible, partially dividing the road and potentially reducing the navigable space, which could lead to changes in traffic patterns, requiring the vehicle to recognize these changes.\n\nFinally, there is another object, an electronic illuminated billboard installed above the road on the right, displaying text or advertisements. Though it does not directly affect driving behavior, its bright illumination and content may distract the driver or vehicle sensors."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the white van ahead, ready to respond to any deceleration or stopping. Stay alert for the movements of the orange forklift, as it may enter the roadway. Obey traffic signs, avoid driving into the bike lane, and be aware of potential cyclists. Respect the \"Do Not Enter\" signs and continue along the current route. Since there are obstacles on the right, the vehicle should stay in its own lane and not attempt any right turns that might enter restricted areas. Drive carefully, pay close attention to industrial vehicles crossing from left to right, ensure correct lane positioning to avoid the parked white van on the right, and watch for cyclists due to the indicated bike lane.",
