While this vehicle is stationary and poses no immediate dynamic threat, it narrows the lane and reduces visibility, potentially affecting the ego vehicle's navigation decisions. Additionally, there is a medium-sized, brown and white dog crossing the road from left to right directly in front of the ego vehicle. The unpredictability of the dog's movements, such as a sudden stop or change in direction, presents a potential hazard to the driving path."

Additionally, due to the wet road conditions, the vehicle should maintain a lower speed to prevent skidding and ensure sufficient reaction time in case the dog's movement becomes erratic. The vehicle should also monitor the dog until it is clear of the roadway to resume normal driving operations. Immediate action is required to ensure the safety of all road users. Activate the hazard lights to alert other drivers of the potential hazard. Once the dog is clear from the road and it is safe to proceed, the ego car should continue driving at a reduced speed considering the wet road conditions to maintain safe stopping distances and tire traction. The vehicle should also maintain a safe distance from the parked sedan on the right given the reduced lane width and potential for other road users to obscure visibility."
