        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are vehicles and vulnerable road users conspicuously visible. On one side of the road, a row of stationary vehicles is observed parked along the left. These parked vehicles could pose a hazard as they constrict the usable road space, which might lead to the risk of pedestrians suddenly stepping out from between these parked cars. Additionally, there is a bicycle without its rider, leaning against the steps by the roadside near a bench. Despite the bicycle's stationary position, its presence indicates that cyclists or pedestrians could be nearby and may unpredictably step onto the road. Consequently, there's a need for heightened vigilance to anticipate and react safely to possible sudden moves near the parked bicycle. All other categories like traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects seem to be absent in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed and be ready to brake for any obstacles or pedestrians that may suddenly emerge from between parked vehicles. Given the good visibility and clear road, continue to monitor for the presence of pedestrians or other road users on both sides, especially in areas near bicycles. If necessary, the vehicle should also be prepared to make a slight left turn to maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles while staying within the lane lines. Be aware of pedestrians or cyclists that may be near bicycles. Watch for oncoming pickup trucks and maintain a proper lane position. Depending on the time of day and lighting conditions, if necessary, reduce speed to improve reaction time to unexpected events and ensure safe driving.",

The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance while passing to avoid any potential obstacles or the opening of car doors. Also, the ego car must be aware of the possibility of the parked car merging back into traffic, necessitating readiness to yield or adjust speed accordingly.",
