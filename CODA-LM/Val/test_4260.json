        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene before us, we have several elements that influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. There is a large truck directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The truck's reflective markings are noticeable, and its brake lights are visible, indicating that it's either slowing down or stopped. The position and size of the truck are significant because they may reduce visibility for the ego car driver and block the road, possibly necessitating a change in the autonomous vehicle's trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, there is a worker wearing reflective gear that can be seen between the truck and a series of traffic cones. It is likely that the worker is engaged in roadwork or maintenance activities. The presence of this road worker requires the ego vehicle to exercise extra caution to ensure the worker's safety and may be a sign that the lane is closed or restricted.\n\nAs for signage in the area, a blue circular sign commands vehicles to maintain a right path in passing around the worker and the roadwork that is being done. This is complemented by a yellow temporary warning sign affixed to a fence on the side, signaling the presence of roadwork or temporary conditions ahead.\n\nIn terms of physical road separations, multiple traffic cones are arranged in a line. They create a barrier between the utility truck/work area and the vehicular path, directing traffic to safely maneuver around this work zone and maintain a safe distance. Furthermore, an additional barrier is visible alongside the traffic cones and serves to emphasize the division between the work area and the traffic lane. It reinforces the direction provided by the signs and cones for the vehicles to stay on the clear side of the road.\n\nNo traffic lights and other objects impacting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle are observed in this scene."

Extra caution should be exercised due to the wet road conditions and reduced visibility from the bright lights of the utility truck. Turn on hazard lights to alert other drivers of the intention to slow down or maneuver. Increased following distance should be maintained due to wet road conditions. Additionally, obey any temporary signals or directions from road workers to safely pass the work zone."
