        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several vehicles and scenarios that impact the autonomous driving behavior. First, there's a heavy construction vehicle, possibly a forklift, ahead in the same lane as our vehicle, traveling in the same direction and emitting visible exhaust fumes. These emissions could affect the visibility and air quality for the autonomous vehicle, which should, therefore, increase its following distance and be prepared for unexpected stops or movements from the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a red flatbed truck is traveling ahead in the same lane and in the same direction as our vehicle. It occupies most of the lane's width, prompting the necessity for self-driving vehicles to maintain a safe following distance. This precaution is to ensure thereâ€™s sufficient time to react if the truck stops or turns suddenly.\n\nOn the left side of the road, a silver SUV is parked, with a possibility that the driver's side door is open. This situation calls for vigilance for pedestrians that may emerge from between parked vehicles. It also suggests that, when safely possible, the autonomous vehicle should adjust its lateral position to the right to create extra space.\n\nLastly, the image shows that vehicles of various kinds are parked on both sides of the road, significantly restricting the maneuvering space available. These parked vehicles may also merge into the traffic flow unexpectedly, requiring constant attention from the autonomous system to adapt its driving strategy accordingly.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects were reported in the image, suggesting that these categories do not currently impact autonomous vehicle behavior in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the red flatbed truck and construction vehicles ahead, and be prepared for their sudden movements or stops. Stay vigilant for pedestrians that may suddenly appear from the SUV parked on the left. Continue to monitor changes in road conditions and possible obstacles ahead. If possible, adjust your vehicle's lateral position to the right to maintain a safe distance from the parked SUV, provided it does not compromise your vehicle's safety or lane position.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large construction vehicle, specifically a forklift. It features high-visibility coloring, typically orange or red, and has a lifting fork apparatus at the front. Due to its size and nature, the vehicle is often slower and may make unexpected movements as it operates near construction sites. The presence of this vehicle on the road requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, reduce speed, and stay alert for sudden stops or turns by the construction vehicle.",
