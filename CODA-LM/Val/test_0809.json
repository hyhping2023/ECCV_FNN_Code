We need to be cautious of the truck's movements since it could block the view of the road ahead and suggest the presence of construction or maintenance work that may disrupt the usual traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple passenger vehicles to the left of the ego vehicle, sharing the road and moving in the same direction. The proximity and speed of these cars should be noted by the autonomous system, as they could affect the ego car's ability to safely change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere is also a bicyclist to the far right, utilizing a dedicated bike lane and traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Careful monitoring is needed to ensure that the bicyclist stays within their lane and does not pose a hazard by potentially veering into the path of the vehicle.\n\nA blue directional traffic sign is installed on the right side of the road, instructing a mandatory right turn for one of the lanes. This sign guides the drivers in lane selection and could influence the traveling speed in that section of the road due to the lane splitting off to the right.\n\nFurthermore, concrete roadside barriers are present on the right side, acting as a division between the bike lane and the road. These barriers provide safety for the bike lane by decreasing the likelihood of the bicyclist entering the vehicle's moving lane."

Observe the road signs to prepare for any lane changes or turns that might be required in the upcoming junction or division of the road. Do not attempt to overtake the concrete mixer truck until a clear and safe opportunity arises, after considering the road divider to the left and potential congestion on the opposite side. Keep watch of the cyclist on the sidewalk to the right, and comply with traffic signs including the mandatory right turn ahead. Proceed with caution, anticipating potential traffic flow changes due to the turn-off indicated by the traffic sign."
