A white van is noted as parked on the right side of the lane, partially obstructing it, leading to a need for caution and potentially necessitating a lane change to safely navigate past it. Additionally, multiple cars are parked under trees on the right side, with one covered in a protective cover, creating a risk of pedestrians stepping out from between the vehicles or doors opening into the lane. An orange forklift is also parked on the right-hand lane, positioned away from the observing vehicle. This unusual presence on the road means that one must either halt to assess if the forklift is moving or change lanes to overtake it safely. Oncoming traffic conditions are visible, as indicated by headlights facing towards our vehicle, necessitating vigilance for any erratic behaviors or lane changes from these vehicles.\n\nThe traffic light system in this image shows a green light ahead, located beside the bus stop on the left, suggesting that the vehicle can proceed. However, due to the green light, special attention must be paid to the interactions around the parked van and the forklift to ensure safe travel. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects have been described in the image, indicating they do not impact the driving environment in the current context."

If safe, prepare to change lanes to bypass the obstacle, follow traffic signals, and be alert to any sudden changes in the environment, particularly parked vehicles that may obstruct pedestrians or doors that may open suddenly.
