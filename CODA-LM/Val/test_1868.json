This poses the need for a potential lane change to avoid a collision because the forklift could obstruct our vehicle's path. Additionally, a green traffic light is observed ahead, signaling that it is permissible to proceed through the intersection, assuming the road ahead is clear and it is safe to do so. Furthermore, a green fabric barrier is present on the right, demarcating the edge of the roadway from a construction area, which is instrumental in keeping the vehicle at a safe distance from the work zone. There is also a blue barrier on the right, delineating the construction site from the road, a reminder to be vigilant about possible unforeseen obstructions or workers due to construction activities along the roadway. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive cautiously and be prepared to change lanes to the left if necessary to maintain a safe distance from forklifts and adhere to lane boundaries. When the traffic light is green, it indicates safe passage, allowing you to continue through the intersection or along the road. Always be vigilant of potential sudden movements by forklifts. Self-driving vehicles should also be aware of possible movements within areas enclosed by green barriers and anticipate the need for further maneuvers. Additionally, monitor the traffic lights for potential changes. While maintaining awareness of your surroundings, proceed carefully through intersections to avoid other potential hazards that may arise in construction areas.",

            "description and explanation": "This object is a forklift, which is often used in construction sites or areas where heavy materials need to be lifted and transported. This vehicle is encroaching slightly into the roadway from what appears to be a construction zone, marked by the green fencing material. Given its position, it could potentially influence traffic flow by narrowing the usable lane, causing vehicles such as the ego car to slow down or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential hazards. The presence of this forklift is an indication of nearby construction activity and requires increased driver vigilance to respond to unexpected movements or obstacles related to this activity.",
