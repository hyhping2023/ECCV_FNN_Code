No traffic signs or traffic lights are present within the captured view. However, there are orange and white reflective traffic cones lined up, which suggest that there may be either narrowing lanes or road construction ahead. These cones serve as a directive for vehicles to adjust their driving route in response. Additionally, an obstacle resembling a pavilion or a controlled checkpoint is visible on the road, positioned near the traffic lane. This does not block the vehicle's path directly, but it indicates the possibility of nearby pedestrian activity, and it may cause vehicles to decelerate or come to a stop."
