        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several notable road users and signals that impact driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there is a green cement mixer truck traveling on the same lane ahead of the autonomous vehicle. The presence of this cement mixer is significant because it may suddenly stop or decelerate unexpectedly along its route. This uncertainty affects the driving speed and following distance of the autonomous vehicle. Additionally, due to the cement mixer's size, it might obstruct the view ahead, making it essential for the autonomous vehicle to be always ready for sudden maneuvers to maintain safety.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a blue circular sign is visible on the right side of the road. It features a white arrow in the middle pointing to the right, indicating that there is a mandatory direction change ahead and the vehicle must turn right. This sign plays a crucial role in informing the autonomous vehicle of the required driving direction, ensuring that it prepares accordingly to follow the indicated path.\n\nAs for traffic lights, the image includes a traffic light that is directly ahead and displaying a red signal specifically for the vehicleâ€™s lane. The red light is critical as it mandates the vehicle to come to a complete stop. The vehicle must then wait for the light to turn green before it can proceed, following the traffic rules and ensuring safety at the intersection.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Thus, the autonomous vehicle's immediate driving decisions and behavior adjustments are influenced primarily by the green cement mixer truck ahead, the mandatory right-turn sign, and the red traffic light signal."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance behind the cement mixer truck, be ready to stop or slow down at any moment, and come to a complete stop according to the traffic light signals when the red light is on. Additionally, you should be prepared to make a right turn based on the road signs and divider indications, ensuring to stay within the turning lane and not crossing over the divider into the adjacent lane. It is also important to continuously monitor the changes in traffic light signals and any unexpected maneuvers that the cement mixer truck may make. Moreover, your vehicle should not proceed straight in the far right lane, as traffic cones and signs indicate that it is a dedicated turning lane. Drivers should watch the traffic lights and only proceed when the green light is on, paying attention to whether pedestrians or other vehicles are entering the intersection. If the behavior of the cement mixer truck suggests it will stop or significantly slow down, overtaking may be considered, but it must be ensured that the adjacent lane is clear of other vehicles and safe before doing so.",
