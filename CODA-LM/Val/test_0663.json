Further down the road, a bus is moving in the same direction as the ego car, suggesting there might be a bus stop ahead and the possibility of the bus stopping to pick up or drop off passengers.\n\nA cyclist is also present, riding within a marked bicycle lane in the same direction as the ego car. This necessitates careful overtaking by the ego car, ensuring a safe distance is maintained. Road signage is visible, including a sign indicating a bicycle lane, which informs the ego car to expect cyclists. Another sign indicates that both a left turn and moving straight ahead are permissible at the upcoming intersection. Additionally, a 'No parking' sign is present, reinforcing the restriction of stopping or parking in the area, especially near the road work.\n\nAt an intersection in the distance, traffic lights show a green light for going straight, allowing the ego car to proceed but with caution for any changes. Traffic cones are positioned along the edge of the rightmost lane, signaling a reduction in lane width or availability and prompting the ego car to move left. Temporary fencing is erected on the right curb, indicating a no-entry zone due to an ongoing work site and directing pedestrian traffic away from the area.\n\nOther objects include a dustbin and a boarded-up area on the sidewalk behind the maintenance work, which, while not directly impacting the driving path, indicate ongoing work and potential pedestrian activity. Road work barriers, tools, and some debris are also visible on the right side pavement, which could lead to potential hazards or unexpected movements from workers or equipment."
