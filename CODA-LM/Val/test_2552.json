The presence of this truck is significant as it may slow down or stop abruptly due to construction work, and its large size could obstruct the ego car's path or cause debris to fall onto the road. Additionally, there is a directional sign on the right side of the road. Although the details on the sign are not clear, such signs are important for providing route information that is essential for navigation. Furthermore, traffic cones are placed on the side of the road, signaling potential road work or hazards ahead. These cones indicate that drivers should be cautious when passing this area because the road layout or condition might be different from the norm. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Always be prepared for unexpected movements from the construction vehicle and continue to monitor for any additional road signs or signals that may provide further instructions."
