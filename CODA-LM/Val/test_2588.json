    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the presence of an excavator and nearby pedestrians at the intersection, the driver should slow down and be prepared to stop. The driver should be vigilant for potential construction signals ahead and follow temporary traffic directions at all times. Additionally, as the roads are slippery, the driver should maintain a greater distance from the vehicle ahead and reduce speed to accommodate the potential decrease in traction. Caution is advised due to construction vehicles ahead. If construction vehicles begin to move, be prepared to stop or yield. Continuously watch for pedestrians that may appear around the crosswalk and maintain a speed that allows for a safe and complete stop.",
