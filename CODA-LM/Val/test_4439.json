This vehicle directly influences the ego vehicle's path and speed, and its bulky load affects its balance and predictability, potentially complicating overtaking or maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple parked cars on the left side of the road, stationary, which reduce the available road width and could obstruct the ego vehicle's vision of any oncoming traffic or pedestrians. There are also stationary cars parked parallel on the right side of the road, whose presence should prompt the ego car to be alert for open doors or pedestrians emerging from between them.\n\nPedestrians are walking along the side of the road on the right, facing the ego car, with one possibly intending to cross. These pedestrians are potential hazards as they may step into the ego car's path, necessitating heightened attention, especially for the one who looks like they may cross the road.\n\nThere are metal barriers on the left side that separate the oncoming traffic lanes from those the ego car is traveling in, indicating that the ego car should stay in its lane and avoid maneuvers involving crossing into oncoming traffic. Additionally, metal barriers on the right side separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkway, which limit the available maneuvering space and define the drivable area.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects were recorded in the image."

Continue to monitor the road conditions for any changes or unexpected obstacles. Overtaking should be done with caution, ensuring that it's safe to pass and that there is enough space to do so without endangering the pedestrians."
