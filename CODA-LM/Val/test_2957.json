        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, there is a large truck in front of the ego car, characterized by reflective markings and illuminated tail lights, which suggest that it may be in motion or at a standstill. The truck is likely commercial, possibly a garbage truck, identified by its rear design and visible debris. The presence of this truck is significant for the autonomous driving system as it obstructs the view ahead and takes up the entire lane, mandating a safe following distance. The system must be ready to stop or circumvent the truck, which could slow down traffic due to its size and potential to make sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic light ahead, situated to the right of the truck, instructing the ego car to halt. This traffic light is critical for the driving system to observe in order to adhere to traffic regulations and maintain road safety by coming to a complete stop.\n\nFurthermore, the scene includes multiple traffic cones located on the right side of the truck, implying that a section of the road is blocked for construction or roadwork. This setup necessitates that the driving system be aware of the potential need for a lane change or merge due to the lane closure indicated by the traffic cones.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects reported in the image; hence, they do not influence the driving behavior in the current snapshot of this traffic scene."

In the context of road safety, bollards are used to control road traffic and are intended to prevent vehicles from passing through certain areas, which may be reserved for pedestrians or for specific types of vehicles. Since bollards are often used to delineate pedestrian areas or protect vulnerable structures from accidental vehicle impact, the ego car must not drive over or near them. This suggests that the ego car should stay within its designated lane and be aware of the boundaries outlined by these bollards, which may indicate the presence of a pedestrian zone or a no-driving area ahead.",

Monitor the truck's actions if it resumes movement when the light turns green, and proceed with caution once the traffic signal permits. While stopped, maintain increased following distance from the truck due to wet road conditions. Be prepared to remain stopped until the traffic light turns green and the truck in front proceeds. Use caution when the light changes, as visibility and road conditions may affect reaction times and vehicle behavior. Be aware of the traffic cones indicating potential roadwork and be prepared to change lanes if necessary once it is safe and allowed. Stay alert for any signage or changes in the traffic situation as you approach the intersection."
