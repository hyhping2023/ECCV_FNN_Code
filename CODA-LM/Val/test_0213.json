    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain the current lane and speed while observing whether the white car ahead exhibits any changes in speed or direction. Be aware of vehicles that may enter your lane from a distance, and be prepared to make necessary adjustments. Pay attention to groups of pedestrians on the overpass and those who may cross the street. Your vehicle should keep a safe distance from the motorcycle ahead, being ready to adjust the speed or change lanes for a safe overtaking, and ensuring an appropriate distance is maintained from the white car on the left. It is advisable to monitor the dynamics of the motorcycle in case of sudden changes. Maintain a safe following distance from the black car ahead, watch for its brake lights signaling deceleration or coming to a stop, and be ready to adjust speed. Safely overtake the motorcycle, ensuring there is ample gap. Continue to monitor changes in the road and traffic conditions ahead. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or obstacles affecting the current driving scenario, so there is no need to take immediate action.",

Its reflective surface increases visibility for drivers, which is crucial for safety during both day and night. This particular bollard's placement at the roadside edge signifies a boundary that should be respected by the ego car, ensuring that it does not veer into the pedestrian path or the area dedicated for non-motorized traffic. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from the object while navigating the road.",

Bollards are typically used to control or direct road traffic, such as separating pedestrian areas from vehicle roadways, guiding cars in parking lots, or protecting facilities, sidewalks, and utilities. The presence of a bollard in this context indicates that the ego vehicle should remain in the lane and not attempt to drive over or across the area that the bollard is protecting. This could be especially relevant if there's a pedestrian or bike lane adjacent to the road where the bollard is positioned.",
