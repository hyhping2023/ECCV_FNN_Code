        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, various road users and objects have been identified, significantly shaping the driving environment and decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles. \n\nFirst, there is a white sedan positioned directly in front of our vehicle. It appears to be either slowing down or has come to a halt. The presence and actions of this vehicle are critical as they dictate the driving speed and necessary braking distance for our car, ensuring safety and smooth traffic flow.\n\nOn the left side of the road, several cyclists are present. These vulnerable road users necessitate a cautious approach from nearby vehicles, including maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to stop or execute evasive maneuvers promptly. Their safety is paramount, and their presence influences the driving behavior of our vehicle.\n\nAhead, on the right side of the road, a traffic sign is visible, displaying a blue \"T\" to indicate an upcoming \"T\" intersection. This sign serves as a warning to the driver, suggesting the potential need to yield to other road users or execute a turn, thus influencing the vehicleâ€™s navigation decisions.\n\nAdditionally, two yellow and black traffic cones are positioned on the right edge of the driving lane, near the cyclists. These cones likely signal a hazardous area or ongoing construction, warranting caution and a possible adjustment in the path of the cyclists and our vehicle to ensure safe passage around the obstruction.\n\nFurther along, yellow and black barriers on the right side of the road indicate road construction ahead or lane closures. These barriers act as visual cues for the vehicle to remain within its lane and stay vigilant for any potential obstacles or road workers, further impacting driving behavior and route planning.\n\nNo traffic lights or other objects are present in this observation, focusing the attention on the identified road users and objects and their implications for autonomous driving decisions and safety measures."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to stop or follow the white sedan at a safe distance. Due to the appearance of cyclists, the vehicle should also remain vigilant and be ready to safely pass them, considering the potential need to maneuver around traffic cones. The \"T\" intersection sign indicates that your vehicle should be cautious of the upcoming crossroads and be prepared for any necessary maneuvers. Furthermore, since traffic cones and obstacles are partially blocking the lane, your vehicle may need to slightly adjust its lateral position to the left while maintaining its lane. Continue to monitor any changes on the road ahead and adjust speed accordingly, while staying alert to the movements of the white sedan.",

It's commonly used at construction sites or during public events. In this context, the ego car should acknowledge the barrier's presence and understand that it may indicate either a restricted area or an alteration in the typical traffic pattern, such as a lane closure or detour. The driver should be prepared to adjust their driving path accordingly, paying close attention to any additional signs or signals that may provide further instruction.",
