        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several vehicles and objects that the ego car must navigate around. A white SUV is parked on the right side of the road with its hazard lights on, which could potentially open its door or move into traffic unexpectedly. Ahead in the same lane, there is a stationary silver car that the ego car must maintain a safe distance from. Directly in front of the ego vehicle, a white car is slightly off-center in the lane, possibly parking or maneuvering, affecting the ego car's speed and trajectory. The street is lined with multiple parked cars on both sides, some of which are occupying the lane, reducing the usable lane width. A silver hatchback is incorrectly parked diagonally on the right, with its rear end sticking out into the traffic lane, creating a maneuvering challenge. Additionally, a white SUV is stopped in traffic in front of the ego car, indicating possible congestion or an obstruction ahead.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image. However, there are blue directional signs overhead further down the road, which will guide the ego car's lane choice and navigation. No traffic lights are visible, suggesting that traffic flow is managed by road signs or rules of the road.\n\nBarriers are present on the right side of the road, blocking off an area with waste containers, which restricts road width and may cause non-standard maneuvers from other traffic participants. Other objects include garbage bins and bags of waste on the right side of the road near the parked cars, which may obstruct the view and pose a risk if pedestrians emerge suddenly. There is also a large pile of refuse or debris next to the parked car on the right, narrowing the drivable path and potentially obscuring pedestrians or animals. Garbage bins and bags are placed on the curb to the right, close to the incorrectly parked silver hatchback vehicle, limiting roadside space and affecting the curb lane's availability."

    "region_perception": {},
    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a moderate speed, be prepared to stop, watch for any sudden movements from the parked vehicles and pedestrians potentially hidden from view by the waste collection area. The driver should also be ready to follow directional signs overhead and choose the appropriate lane in advance while considering narrow lanes due to barriers. Lastly, gentle braking and steering should be applied due to the wet road conditions. Caution is advised when passing the improperly parked silver hatchback and roadside garbage, as lateral space is reduced. The driver should also be attentive to the blue directional signs for potential changes in required lanes or directions."
