Due to its size, operational function, and the same travel direction as the ego vehicle, it could lead to slower traffic or unexpected stops, especially in a construction zone.\n  - Ahead to the left of the cement mixer truck, a silver sedan is partially visible. The proximity of passenger cars to heavy construction vehicles could lead to rapid lane changes, necessitating constant monitoring.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: \n  - Pedestrians are present on the sidewalk to the right, some near the curb. Although not currently on the road, their closeness to the curb requires the ego car to remain attentive to any potential unexpected entry into the roadway.\n  - A motorcyclist is seen between lanes, to the right of the ego vehicle, appearing to be overtaking or lane-splitting. Motorcyclists can be unpredictable and less visible, thus the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden changes.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - The traffic light directly in front of the ego vehicle is red. The ego vehicle must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\n- **Barriers**: \n  - Safety barriers are located on the right side of the road, setting a boundary between the road and sidewalk where construction workers are present. These barriers indicate the presence of a work zone, necessitating the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the barriers.\n\n- **Other Objects**: \n  - A dustbin is placed on the sidewalk to the right. It does not influence the drivable area and therefore does not affect the immediate driving decisions of the ego car."

Caution should also be exercised as the motorcyclist is lane-splitting and may have unpredictable maneuvers. The ego car must stop at the red light and proceed only when it turns green, watching for the workers near the barriers to ensure they do not enter the roadway. Increased situational awareness is advised around the on-road construction activity."
