The ego car needs to be cautious of this person due to their close proximity to the road, which could lead to unpredictable movements. The ego car should be prepared to slow down if the individual's actions suggest it is necessary.\n\nThe image also shows orange traffic cones and a yellow barrier in the middle, indicating a closed lane or work zone ahead. This requires the ego car to be prepared to alter its path, which may include changing lanes if the current lane is closed further along the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a portable yellow metal barrier and a red-and-white striped barrier in front of a gated area, suggesting restricted access or potential lane closures. The ego car should be ready to adjust its route or anticipate detours.\n\nNear the individual by the roadside, there is a traffic cone on the left edge of the image, which might signal roadwork or nearby hazards. The ego car must remain vigilant for any instructions or changes in the road layout.\n\nLastly, the image depicts a low visibility condition, possibly due to fog or haze, which diminishes the clarity of the surroundings. This necessitates the ego car to exercise increased caution, reduce speed, and enhance awareness to respond to any unforeseen hazards."
