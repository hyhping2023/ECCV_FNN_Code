The truck's rear lights, including the brake lights, are clearly visible, indicating that it is slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation is critical as the truck’s size and proximity to the ego vehicle restrict visibility of the road ahead and require the driver to maintain a sufficient following distance to prevent a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there is a set of traffic lights visible just above the truck, displaying a red signal. This red light means that the vehicles traveling in the same direction as the ego car, including the ego car itself, are required to stop. Therefore, the ego vehicle must prepare to come to a stop if it isn't already doing so.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the traffic image, so there’s no need to consider these elements in the current traffic scenario."

It has a large cargo compartment which could potentially obstruct the driver's view of the road ahead. The future driving behavior should involve maintaining a safe distance from this truck to allow for adequate reaction time in case the truck slows down or stops suddenly.
