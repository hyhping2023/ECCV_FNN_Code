A black sedan positioned in the center of the image on the same lane in front of our vehicle, partially obstructing the view. Due to its leading position, its actions, such as braking or turning, will directly affect our vehicle's driving decisions.\n2. A white SUV parked perpendicularly to the right of our vehicle, possibly waiting to merge into traffic. This SUV may move into our lane, so we need to remain cautious and prepared to yield or brake.\n3. A white van is crossing from left to right across our field of view at the intersection, indicating active traffic that might soon allow our vehicle to proceed.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is one motorcyclist located on the right side of the image, close to the lane for cars and moving parallel to the traffic. The motorcyclist's behavior may be unpredictable and harder to see, necessitating extra attention and readiness to adjust speed or position.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there is a red traffic light straight ahead. This requires all vehicles, including ours, to stop and wait until the light turns green before proceeding.\n\nTraffic cones are also present, lined up in red and white along the right side of the road, indicating lane closure or construction. These cones alter the drivable area, which may require a lane change or speed adjustment for vehicles in this lane.\n\nAt the far end of the intersection, guardrails are visible marking the road boundaries. While they do not require immediate attention, as fixed obstacles, they should be noted within the road environment.\n\nLastly, there is a convex mirror on a pole to the right of the intersection reflecting current traffic conditions. This is intended to help drivers better observe traffic but does not directly impact our vehicleâ€™s driving decisions."

    "driving_suggestion": "As my vehicle prepares to stop due to the red light ahead, it's necessary to monitor whether the white van and the black sedan have any sudden lane changes or stopping behaviors. At the same time, attention should be paid to the position of motorcyclists and remain vigilant for the white SUV that may join the traffic flow. The traffic cones by the roadside indicate that there might be road construction on the right side, thus it's advisable for my vehicle to avoid the rightmost lane. Overall, maintaining a safe following distance, observing the movements of surrounding vehicles, and adhering to traffic signals are crucial. High alert should also be maintained for pedestrians on crosswalks.",
