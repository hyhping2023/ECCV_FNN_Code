Its size and the fact that it takes up the entire lane will affect our vehicle's ability to overtake or maintain current speed. Our vehicle should be prepared to follow this vehicle until it is safe to overtake."

This vehicle, due to its size and position, suggests it could be moving slower, requiring our vehicle to either reduce speed or change lanes to overtake when safe. \n\nSlightly ahead on the left side of this construction vehicle, a cyclist is close to the roadside, posing a potential hazard if our vehicle needs to change lanes to the left or if the cyclist makes sudden movements.

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should prepare to stop at the red light and maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle. Meanwhile, monitor the movements of cyclists and, if necessary, adapt by maintaining lane position and a safe margin or safely changing lanes, to ensure not to disrupt the traffic flow. Pay attention to motorcyclists, ensuring they are not in blind spots or at unsafe positions when the light turns green. In addition, the vehicle should not attempt to overtake unless it is safe to do so, taking into account the traffic conditions, the presence of construction vehicles, and the lanes occupied by motorcycles. The vehicle should drive cautiously, slow down due to wet and slippery road conditions, and prepare to stop at the red light. As the construction vehicle is occupying the right lane, the vehicle should keep to the left lane and prepare to stop or go around the vehicle while being aware of any pedestrians or cyclists.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle loaded on the back of a transport vehicle. It appears to be a type of heavy machinery commonly used in construction activities, such as an excavator or a loader. Its presence indicates that there may be ongoing or upcoming construction work in the vicinity. The fact that it is being transported suggests that it is either being moved to a construction site or away from one after completing its role. Due to the size and nature of this vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance, as construction vehicles can make sudden stops or have parts extending beyond the dimensions of the carrying vehicle that can pose hazards if a collision were to occur.",
