        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a variety of road users and objects that influence the driving behavior of the ego car. Starting with vehicles, there is a white van parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. The van is stationary and does not pose an immediate hazard. However, its location requires vigilance from the ego vehicle due to the potential for unexpected movement or doors opening. The stationary nature of the van does not directly influence the movement of the ego car but reduces the width of the usable lane, necessitating caution while passing.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, present in this scene.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a temporary road work sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating construction or maintenance activity ahead. This sign serves as a warning of possible obstructions or workers on the road, requiring the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution.\n\nThe scene is devoid of traffic lights, indicating no immediate need for the ego car to alter its speed based on signal changes.\n\nTraffic cones and barricades are set up in the right lane, accompanied by an excavator arm extending over the right lane. These indicate active construction work, necessitating a lane closure and likely requiring the ego vehicle to merge left if it is currently in the right lane.\n\nRed and white traffic barriers are also positioned on the right, blocking off an area of the roadside, probably for construction purposes. These barriers delineate the construction zone, indicating that the ego car should stay clear of this area and potentially prepare for lane shifts or narrowing of the drivable road surface.\n\nLastly, other objects in the scene include construction equipment on the right side, featuring an excavator with its arm extending across the right lane. The presence of heavy machinery necessitates increased awareness and the potential for unexpected movement or obstructions, further emphasizing the need for cautious driving in this area."

Additionally, the driver should pass the parked van with caution, ensuring not to veer into the opposite lane."
