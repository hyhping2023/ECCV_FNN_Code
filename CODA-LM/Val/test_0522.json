The only objects observed are trees and shrubs lining the sides of the parking area. While these do not pose an immediate hazard to the vehicle, they should be monitored for potential falling branches or debris. However, since these objects are static and located well outside the driving trajectory, they do not influence driving behavior."

As an inanimate object, it does not have the capacity for movement or interaction with traffic on its own. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of the stone on the roadway can pose a potential hazard. The ego car would need to ensure it avoids driving over or colliding with the stone, which might involve maneuvering around it or stopping if necessary to avoid damage to the vehicle or loss of control.",
