The truck has visible Chinese characters on the side of its mixer drum. This vehicle poses a potential hazard as it is large and its position may obscure the view of the road ahead. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance to ensure visibility and reaction time in case the truck changes lanes or stops suddenly.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic lights in the image are green, visible over the top of the cement mixer truck. The green light indicates that it is safe for the ego vehicle to proceed, but this should be done with caution due to the presence of the cement mixer truck. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
