The ego car will need to slightly move to the left when passing by to maintain a safe distance.\n- There is a parked black sedan on the right side with its boot open and an individual standing close by, indicating possible activity. This situation could pose a risk if the person steps onto the road or the car door opens. The ego car should be prepared to react, such as reducing speed or stopping.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A pedestrian is present near the open boot of the parked black sedan on the right side of the road. The ego car should be cautious, anticipating that the pedestrian might enter the roadway or close the boot abruptly and present a potential hazard.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There is a parking sign labeled \"P\" alongside a smaller sign detailing parking regulations on the right side of the road. The presence of these signs corresponds to the parked vehicles and indicates specific parking rules in this area.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A traffic light on the right side of the road is showing green, which means the ego vehicle can proceed. Nonetheless, the ego car should stay alert for changes in the traffic light.\n\nOther Objects:\n- On the sidewalk near the ego car, there appears to be a parked scooter or moped. Since it is not on the road path and is currently stationary, it does not directly affect the ego car's driving behavior as long as it remains in its place.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or barriers in the image, so there is no need to consider these categories for this particular scenario."
