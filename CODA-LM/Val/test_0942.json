Additionally, a large red crane is positioned on the right side of the road, which could move or extend, influencing the road space nearby.\n\nOn the right side, near the traffic cones, multiple construction workers are visible. These workers could potentially step into the vehicle's path, thus requiring the driver to exercise caution to ensure safety.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are arranged in a line, marking the construction zone from the active traffic lane. These cones indicate a lane closure and obligate the ego car to remain in the open lane, away from the construction area.\n\nTemporary green barriers have been set up to shield the construction site from the road.
