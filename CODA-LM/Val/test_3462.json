It is crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from these vehicles to allow for adequate reaction time in case they slow down or stop abruptly. Additionally, there are blurred vehicles in the opposite lane with their headlights on. Although visibility is low and details are unclear, their presence indicates potential oncoming traffic, which the ego car should be mindful of.\n\nThe traffic lights in the distance are not clearly visible at the moment. Therefore, the ego car should continue at its current speed while being ready to adjust to the traffic signals once they become more apparent.\n\nOn the left side of the ego car's lane, there is a series of orange traffic cones that narrow the drivable path, possibly due to road work or an obstruction. These cones are directing vehicles and altering the normal lane patterns. Consequently, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with caution to navigate the modified lane safely."

Additionally, the driver should be alert for any other potential hazards due to the low light conditions and the possibility of workers or obstacles near the lane reduction. Proceed at a safe speed given the lighting conditions, be prepared for possible lane shifts due to roadwork indicated by the cones, and stay alert for any changes in traffic light signals as they become visible. Use low beam headlights if not already in use to ensure visibility of the road ahead and road markings. Given the low visibility situation and the presence of traffic cones indicating a potential lane closure or roadwork, the ego car should reduce speed and increase following distance to react to any sudden changes in the traffic pattern ahead. The car should be prepared to navigate around the cones while being watchful for any possible workers or equipment in the area. Headlights should be properly adjusted to ensure maximum visibility without blinding oncoming traffic."
