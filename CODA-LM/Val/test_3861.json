On the left side, slightly ahead in the adjacent lane, there is a white hatchback. The autonomous vehicle must be prepared for the possibility that this vehicle may change lanes or decelerate. Directly in front of the autonomous vehicle, occupying the adjacent lane, is a white cement mixer truck. The self-driving car should monitor the truck's speed and movement conditions to adjust its speed or switch lanes if necessary. On the right side, traveling in the same direction, is a burgundy sedan. The autonomous vehicle needs to monitor this vehicle's relative speed and driving trajectory as it is also capable of changing lanes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist ahead between the lanes who appears to be moving slowly or weaving through the traffic. The presence of the motorcyclist increases the need for careful handling and monitoring due to their unpredictable movements.\n\nLastly, metal fence isolation piers are present, separating the oncoming traffic lanes. These barriers indicate the direction of traffic flow and prevent lane changes across the central divider, ensuring that traffic follows a set path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the uncertainty of the traffic light conditions and the relative positions of surrounding vehicles, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck ahead, especially considering the possibility of slippery road conditions. It is recommended to regularly check blind spots in case vans or sedans decide to switch lanes. This vehicle should also be prepared to respond accordingly to nearby traffic lights, which requires paying attention to discern their status as one approaches the lights. Maintain a safe distance from the white truck ahead. Stay alert to the movements of motorcyclists and cyclists as they may affect the flow of traffic. If traffic conditions change, be ready to stop or slow down, and look out for any traffic lights or signs that become visible to further guide driving behavior. Avoid sudden lane changes to prevent having to swerve around large vehicles that could obstruct the view ahead, such as concrete mixer trucks.",
