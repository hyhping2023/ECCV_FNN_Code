One is wearing a dark jacket, and the other has a dark top with light pants. They are engaged in moving bags and items across the street, interacting with a pushcart positioned in the middle of the road at the edge of a pedestrian crossing. The presence of these pedestrians in the roadway puts them in a vulnerable position, as they could potentially be at risk if traffic were to proceed. Their actions could lead to distraction or sudden movement into the path of the ego car, necessitating careful attention from the driver.\n\nAdditionally, the category of other objects contains numerous bags and items scattered on the road near the crossing. These objects act as obstacles that need to be navigated around. The presence of these items on the road can cause obstruction, requiring the ego car to adjust its path to avoid them, ensuring safe passage through the area.\n\nNo vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this traffic image, indicating a specific focus on the interaction between the ego car, pedestrians, and road obstacles in this scenario."
