                "explanation": "The truck's proximity and movement are important as it may influence the ego car's ability to change lanes or adjust speed. The size and position of the truck adjacent to the ego car suggest that it is either being overtaken by the ego car or the ego car is in a separate lane. The proximity to such a large vehicle requires cautious driving due to potential blind spots and the truck's limited maneuverability."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario described, there is a significant presence of a large red vehicle, likely a truck, which is in motion. The truck is carrying some sort of piping or cylindrical objects on its flatbed, and there is noticeable movement blur around its wheels. This indicates that the truck is either being overtaken by or is in a separate lane from the ego car. The ego car's driving behavior is affected by this vehicle as its size and the load it carries could influence lane changing or speed adjustments. Furthermore, careful driving is necessitated due to potential blind spots and the truckâ€™s limited ability to maneuver. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are not present in this particular traffic image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a section of a large vehicle, specifically the undercarriage of a truck or trailer. It includes a set of wheels, part of the chassis, and cargo securing mechanisms such as straps. For the ego car, this indicates the presence of a large, possibly heavy vehicle that may have limited maneuverability. It suggests the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be cautious if considering overtaking, as the larger vehicle's blind spots could obscure the ego car from the truck driver's view.",

Overtaking should only be done with caution, ensuring there is adequate visibility and space to do so safely. Maintain a safe distance from the truck and monitor its indicators for potential turns or lane changes. If overtaking, ensure the maneuver is completed quickly and safely without lingering in the truck's blind spots. If in a separate lane, be prepared for the possibility of the truck merging or changing lanes, which should influence the ego car to adjust speed accordingly or change lanes if possible to maintain safety."
