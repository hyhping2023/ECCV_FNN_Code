The second is an active white sedan visible further ahead, also on the right, with its tail lights on, which indicates the vehicle is operating and may affect the traffic conditions for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are reflective delineator posts along the right roadside. These posts are important for the ego car as they mark the boundaries of the driving lane and provide guidance to stay within the lane at night or in low-visibility conditions.\n\nLastly, there is a barrier or construction area partially visible behind the parked silver sedan to the right. Although this barrier does not directly impede the drivable lane, it implies the presence of construction activity or obstructions nearby, and a heightened level of awareness and caution is advisable for the ego car. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."
