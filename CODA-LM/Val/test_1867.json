The presence of these vehicles may restrict lane usage for the self-driving car, and the potential movement of any of these cars requires vigilance for unpredictable behavior.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones are positioned at the roadside, clearly marking an area where driving is not allowed. These cones serve as a visual cue for autonomous vehicles to remain within the lane and avoid deviating towards the roadside.\n\nA metal fence runs along the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the road and the adjacent property. This barrier is an important guide for self-driving vehicles to maintain their path within the road limits.\n\nOther objects observed include cement piles placed at regular intervals along the right edge of the sidewalk. These bollards are intended to protect pedestrians and property from any vehicular damage and to ensure that autonomous vehicles stay within the designated driving lanes. Additionally, there is a black trash can beside the traffic cone on the roadside. This trash can is situated on the outer side of the road and should not influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle as long as it remains off the road."
