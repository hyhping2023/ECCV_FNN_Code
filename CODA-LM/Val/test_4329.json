In terms of vehicles, there is a large concrete mixer truck on the right lane moving in the same direction as the ego car, slightly ahead of its position. The size and load of this truck may affect its maneuverability and stopping distance, thus requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. A smaller flatbed truck is also present in the left lane, ahead of the mixer truck, which requires close monitoring due to its proximity. Additionally, passenger vehicles are visible in the distance beyond the trucks, traveling in the same direction, potentially affecting the flow of traffic and lane changes.\n\nFor traffic signs, a roundabout sign is visible on the left side of the image, indicating a roundabout ahead and necessitating the ego car to potentially reduce speed and yield. There is also a circular blue sign with the number '9' on it, signifying a minimum speed limit that vehicles should maintain.\n\nA traffic light showing a green signal is visible ahead, allowing the ego car and other vehicles to proceed.\n\nOn the right side, there are green fencing and blue barriers indicating construction or roadwork adjacent to the lane, requiring vehicles to maintain a safe distance from the worksite.\n\nFinally, there is some discoloration on the road surface, indicating that while the road appears mostly clear, drivers should remain vigilant for unexpected obstacles, especially in construction areas."

Constantly assess the road for unexpected hazards and adjust the speed accordingly to match the trucks' speed while being prepared to slow down if they do. Monitor the speed to comply with the minimum speed limit indicated by the traffic sign. Be prepared to stop in case the traffic lights change and watch for any other road users entering the intersection. Stay alert for any potential hazards from the construction zone marked by the barriers."
