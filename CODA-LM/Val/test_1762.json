The placement of these vehicles creates a possible hazard where pedestrians might emerge unexpectedly, and they reduce the width of the drivable road. The ego car must be vigilant for any signs of movement from these parked vehicles and be cautious of doors opening or pedestrians appearing from between them.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users or traffic signs in this scene.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights visible in this particular scene, the ego car will have to navigate through the area relying on the behavior of other road users and any present road markings to make safe driving decisions.\n\nTraffic cones are situated on the right side of the road, indicating a potential area of roadwork or a requirement for traffic organization. The ego vehicle needs to pay attention to these cones, which may necessitate a reduction in speed or alertness for changes in the direction of travel.\n\nAdditionally, there are barriers or fencing beyond the area marked by cones on the right side of the road, potentially signifying a construction zone or a restricted area. The presence of these barriers emphasizes the importance for the ego car to keep a safe distance from the right side to circumvent any complications arising from the restricted area or ongoing roadwork.\n\nLastly, a brightly lit area is visible on the upper left side of the scene, which might be from street lighting or signage. This light could cause glare, which would demand the ego car to exercise increased caution while driving through this area to maintain safe visibility."

Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the right, while staying within the lane of travel demarcated by the traffic cones. Be vigilant for any unexpected obstacles that might appear suddenly from between parked cars or areas of low visibility. The ego car should maintain a safe speed considering the wet road conditions. Ensure to stay in the lane while cautiously passing the parked vehicles and navigate past the traffic cones and barriers by reducing speed and being prepared to stop or maneuver if necessary. Be attentive to possible work zones and adjust the vehicle's position in the lane to safely pass all road work indicators."
