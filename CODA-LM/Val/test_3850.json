This truck can obscure visibility and reduce the navigable road space, necessitating caution and potentially a lane change by the ego car. In the distance ahead, on the right-hand side, there are dimly lit green traffic lights. These lights indicate that the ego car can proceed if the intersection is clear, but given the distance, they could change. Additionally, barricades are seen beside the truck, likely indicating a construction area or a closed zone, which suggests driving with caution to avoid potential hazards or restricted zones. Finally, street lights along the road provide minimal illumination, emphasizing the need for enhanced attention to detect any poorly lit hazards."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a heavy vehicle, specifically a truck that is partially visible in the image. It has distinctive features such as a large cargo compartment and is typically used for the transportation of goods and materials. In the context of driving behavior, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance if approaching the truck from behind, allowing for ample space to stop or maneuver in case the truck slows down or stops abruptly. Since the truck can obstruct the driver's view of the road ahead, it is important to be cautious when attempting to overtake and ensure there is clear visibility and enough room to pass safely.",
