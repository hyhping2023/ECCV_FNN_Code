Although no vehicles directly affect the path of the ego car, there are blurred images of parked vehicles on both sides of the street, which are potential sources of unexpected movements like doors opening or pedestrians emerging. A significant hazard is a dog seen walking across the middle of the road ahead, necessitating careful measures by the ego car to avoid harming the animal and ensuring overall safety.\n\nThere are various illuminated shop signs on the sides of the road, but no specific traffic signs are discernible due to poor image quality. Consequently, the ego car must rely on general traffic rules and real-time observation in the absence of clear traffic signs. Additionally, the traffic lights are not clearly visible, making it impossible to determine their state, which is crucial for decision-making at intersections. However, the presence of the dog takes precedence over traffic light signals in this scenario.\n\nFurthermore, the bright lights and reflections from various shops and lights along the side of the road distract and impair visibility, potentially affecting the driver's ability to perceive other road users and traffic signals effectively."

The parked vehicles along the road also require attention as they may present sudden obstacles if a pedestrian emerges or a car door opens. Furthermore, given the nighttime setting and lower visibility, the ego car should proceed with caution with reduced speed, heightened awareness for unexpected road users or obstacles, and adherence to traffic rules for night driving. Reduce speed immediately and prepare to come to a complete stop if necessary to allow the animal to safely cross the road. Activate hazard lights to alert other road users of the potential hazard. Since traffic lights are not visible in the image, proceed with caution and be attentive for any other traffic control signals or road users that may be present beyond the camera's field of view or range of clarity."
