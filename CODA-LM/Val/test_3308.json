One car is closer to the ego vehicle and easily noticeable with white paint, and its headlights and taillights are lit. The other car is positioned further away and is less visible due to the low lighting conditions in the area. These parked vehicles are considered potential hazards because they narrow the available space on the roadway for the ego car to maneuver. Additionally, there is a possibility that pedestrians or other objects could be hidden from view by these cars. To ensure safety, it is essential for the ego car to keep an adequate distance while overtaking or passing by these parked cars. There are no other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects reported in this traffic image."

It is characterized by a reflective surface that captures the ambient light, indicating its location to other road users. For the ego car, this signifies the need to stay vigilant and possibly adjust its trajectory to maintain a safe distance from the parked car, ensuring there is no contact as it passes. The ego car should also be aware of the possibility that the parked car could become a moving obstacle if it starts to pull out onto the road, which necessitates readiness to react if such a situation arises.",

The ego vehicle should use its headlights and if equipped, activate any low-visibility or fog-driving assistant systems. The vehicle should drive at a reduced speed to allow ample time to react to unseen hazards, maintain a greater following distance than usual to react to the movements of the parked car or any other unforeseen obstacles. If there's an option to activate high-beam headlights without affecting other traffic, do so to increase the visibility further."
