Ahead, in the same lane as the ego car, there are several vehicles moving in the same direction at varying distances, indicating the flow and speed of traffic that the ego car should follow, requiring potential speed adjustments or lane changes. A motorcycle with a blue cover is located in front and slightly to the right of the ego car, in the same lane, necessitating careful observation by the ego car due to its smaller size and potential for unexpected movements. On the opposite side of the street, cars are moving in the opposite direction, which the ego car should monitor for any unexpected turns or pedestrians.\n\nA cyclist is present to the right side of the ego car, coming from the front and crossing the projected path of the ego car, which means the ego car must ensure not to obstruct the cyclist's path and maintain a safe distance. A round traffic sign indicating a speed limit of 40 is placed on the right side of the road ahead, instructing the ego car on the maximum speed to maintain.\n\nOrange traffic cones are positioned on the left edge of the ego car's lane, leading ahead, indicating a section of the road that is either off-limits or undergoing maintenance, requiring the ego car to stay to the right when passing. Lastly, there are dustbins on the right sidewalk, near parked cars and shops, which do not immediately impact the road, but the ego car should stay alert to the possibility of pedestrians emerging from this area to access the bins."
