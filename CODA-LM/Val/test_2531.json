This vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a silver car in the rightmost lane ahead at a distance, also moving in the same direction. While the distance provides ample reaction time, the behavior of this vehicle should be tracked to anticipate any potential braking or lane switching.\n\nOverhead, there are directional signs across all lanes that provide lane guidance. These signs do not immediately affect driving behavior but indicate the need to choose the correct lane for the desired route well in advance.\n\nOn the boundary of the right lane, there is a series of orange-and-white traffic cones indicating a lane closure or roadwork ahead. This necessitates a merge to the left if in the affected lane.\n\nFurthermore, continuous green construction barriers are present on the right side of the roadway. These barriers indicate road works or similar obstructions and require vehicles to maintain a safe distance from the barrier to avoid any potential hazards on the side of the road."

Monitor the Silver car's intentions, especially if a lane change becomes necessary due to the traffic cones on the left. Watch for any indications of merging traffic from the right as the lane narrows. Continue to follow the road signs for directions, and no immediate action is required unless a route change is needed. Maintain current speed and lane, while monitoring the white sedan on the left for any changes in behavior. Be prepared to slow down if traffic conditions change due to the potential road works indicated by the traffic cones and barriers. Continue to observe the signage overhead to ensure the ego vehicle is in the proper lane for its intended route. Stay vigilant for any further instructions or changes in road conditions."
