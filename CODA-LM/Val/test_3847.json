Ahead in the same direction, several passenger vehicles are scattered across the lane, and two passenger cars are in the center lane; these necessitate the vehicle to be vigilant about their speeds and movements to adjust its own velocity or change lanes appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic light at the intersection ahead that commands the vehicle to halt before the intersection and wait for it to turn green.\n\nOn the left side of the road, temporary traffic barriers indicate construction or roadwork. These barriers are meant to manage traffic flow and might suggest a reduction in the number of lanes or changes to typical traffic patterns, which requires drivers to be cautious of these altered conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down in preparation to stop before the red light, maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, and remain vigilant for potential navigation changes due to roadworks indicated by obstacles. At the same time, monitoring the cement mixer in the adjacent lane is critical, as it may affect lane-changing decisions after crossing the intersection. It is also essential to ensure that the vehicle travels along the lanes marked by traffic cones. Presently, there seems to be no immediate need to change lanes, but it is advisable to monitor surrounding traffic in case of unforeseen driving maneuvers.",

Given its significant size and the potential for it to be entering or exiting a construction site, the driver of the ego car should be cautious and maintain a safe following distance. The behavior of this vehicle could influence traffic flow, and the driver of the ego car should be prepared for sudden stops or slow movement associated with construction activity.",
