        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a few elements captured which influence driving behavior and require attention.\n\nRegarding vehicles, there is a white sedan directly ahead with its brake lights on, indicating it may be slowing down or stopped, and hence our vehicle must maintain a safe distance. To the right and slightly ahead, there is a golden hatchback parallel to the sedan that suggests there might be slowing traffic or a queue forming. Furthermore, there's also a white van in the adjacent lane to the right, facing our vehicle. Its presence could restrict lane changing options due to the movement of traffic in that lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users are detected in the scene, which simplifies the dynamics of the current driving environment.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there is a blue directional sign further down the road, providing the appropriate route for the vehicle to follow. Although it does not immediately affect driving actions, it's important for longer-term navigation.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, thus there are no associated instructions or obstructions related to these elements that need to be considered.\n\nThere are a couple of other objects noted. The windshield displays reflections from various interior and exterior lighting, which might obstruct clear visibility and requires extra caution for the driver. Additionally, there is an unidentified black object on the roadside resembling a trash can or a bag, posing a potential hazard as it could obstruct the road, potentially necessitating evasive actions from passing vehicles."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, adjust your speed according to the traffic flow indicated by the surrounding vehicles, and drive cautiously while being mindful of vision issues caused by reflections on the windshield. Due to the wet road surface, self-driving vehicles should maintain a prudent speed to ensure a safe distance from the SUV in front. Be prepared to adjust speed in response to the braking situation of the sedan to the left. Monitor the van parked on the side of the road to see if it will enter the traffic lane and pay close attention to changes in traffic lights, especially when approaching intersections. At the same time, be constantly vigilant for any potential obstacles that may suddenly appear on the road, such as the large object on the right side.",

This type of vehicle is typically used for transporting goods and may require additional space for maneuvering due to its size. In the context of driving behavior, the significant size and slower acceleration of such a truck necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for wider turns the vehicle may take. Overtaking should be done with caution, considering the truck's blind spots and extended length.",
