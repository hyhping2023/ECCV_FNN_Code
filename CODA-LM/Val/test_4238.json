The vehicle features reflective stripes and its rear safety lights are illuminated, signaling that it may be engaged in maintenance work or moving slowly. As a result, the ego car must adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance, proceeding with caution due to the maintenance vehicle's presence.\n\nAdditionally, there are green traffic lights visible in the distance, but it is not clear whether these apply to the lane the ego car is in. While green lights typically signal that it is okay to move forward, the ego car must confirm that the light is indeed for its own lane to ensure the correct response."

This suggests that it is a construction or maintenance vehicle. As a traffic officer assessing the influence on driving behavior, drivers should maintain a safe following distance behind this vehicle, be prepared for it to make sudden stops, and be alert for possible road work ahead that may result in lane closures or detours. Drivers should also be ready to obey any roadwork signs or instructions given by road crew members, as this vehicle is likely part of a road maintenance operation.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the maintenance vehicle, reducing speed as necessary to account for its potential slow movement and the wet road conditions. Be prepared for the vehicle to perform unexpected maneuvers if it is actively engaged in maintenance tasks. Continue to monitor the vehicle's signals for any indication of stopping or turning, and pass with caution if an opportunity becomes available, respecting traffic regulations and current road conditions. Reduce speed due to visibility and road conditions. Confirm which lanes the green traffic lights apply to, and proceed with caution, watching for any additional road users or signs that may be obscured by the weather conditions or limited visibility. Given the conditions, respond appropriately to the vehicle's lights and potential maneuvers, while also being prepared to stop or slow down quickly due to the wet road conditions. Since the traffic light is green, there's no need to stop, but ongoing vigilance for any changes in the traffic light or road conditions is crucial. It's also advisable to have headlights and windscreen wipers active to ensure visibility is maintained."
