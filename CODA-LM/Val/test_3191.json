        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image analyzed, there are several notable road users and objects that influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there are several parked cars on the right side of the road. These parked cars vary in color and model and are aligned parallel to the sidewalk, facing the same direction. The presence of these parked cars presents a risk as there is a possibility of doors opening into the lane of the ego vehicle or pedestrians emerging from between these vehicles. These vehicles are stationary, and it's crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe distance to navigate safely past them.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is observed in the image, appearing blurry due to motion, crossing the road from right to left in close proximity to the moving ego car. The pedestrian's movement towards the roadway suggests a potential entry into the pathway of the ego vehicle. This situation presents a potential hazard, as the path and intentions of the pedestrian are unclear due to the motion blur. It is essential for the ego vehicle to exercise caution in response to the uncertain trajectory and speed of the pedestrian.\n\nThe analysis does not find any relevant traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this particular image affecting the driving scenario, making parked vehicles and the pedestrian the primary subjects of attention in the current driving context."

Proceed with caution and at a low speed due to the possibility of pedestrians stepping out unexpectedly from between parked cars on the right. The ego vehicle should be prepared to stop quickly if the blurred person further enters the roadway. Maintaining vigilance is crucial while passing the parked vehicles."
