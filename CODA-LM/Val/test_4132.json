The industrial vehicle is olive green with visibility markings and appears to be oversized, extending beyond the width of a standard vehicle. The truck hauling the machinery has hazard lights on, indicating it's moving slower or stopped.",

This vehicle is occupying more than one lane and could be moving at a slower pace due to its size and load, presenting an obstacle that the ego vehicle will need to navigate around."

        "description and explanation": "In the image observed, there are several key elements on the road affecting driving behavior and decision-making. Starting with vehicles, there are two noteworthy mentions. Firstly, a large olive green truck branded 'ZOOMLION' prominently occupies the right lane and partially the left lane, where our vehicle, the ego car, is positioned. It's carrying construction equipment, extending beyond the width of a standard vehicle, and has its hazard lights on, signaling that it's either moving slowly or has stopped. This situation necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, possibly requiring speed adjustment to safely navigate around the truck. The truck's encroachment and slower pace due to its size and load present a direct obstacle for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a compact grey SUV is noted driving in the left lane ahead of the ego car but maintains a safe following distance. It's moving parallel to the ego car without any visible signs of distress or abnormal behavior. The SUV's presence directly affects the safe following distance the ego car must keep and might influence the ego vehicle's options for lane changes, especially if overtaking the oversized vehicle becomes necessary.\n\nRegarding road infrastructure, a red and white barrier is noted on the left side of the road ahead, hinting at roadwork or a potential lane closure. This barrier signals that the left lane might not be available for driving or overtaking â€“ a piece of information that becomes crucial considering the oversized vehicle's presence on the road.\n\nFurthermore, red and white traffic barriers are observed on both sides of the road, indicating ongoing construction or maintenance work. These barriers suggest that road work might be ahead, affecting the flow of traffic and possibly requiring changes in lanes by vehicles. The barriers especially limit the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes to the left, constraining the usable road space.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects do not contain relevant observations in this depiction, indicating that they are not present or do not significantly impact the current road situation in this image."

            "description and explanation": "A large vehicle equipped with specialized machinery, commonly seen on construction sites. Its considerable size and potential weight mean the ego car should maintain a safe following distance to allow for adequate reaction time and stopping distance. In addition, the presence of such a vehicle suggests nearby construction activity, which may result in additional traffic signs, changes in traffic flow, or roadworks that require the ego car to adjust speed or lane position accordingly.",

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the SUV and monitor the truck's movements closely. Since the truck is partially in the ego car's lane, the ego car should be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary, while also being vigilant about the barriers indicating a construction zone. Lane changing should be executed only if there is ample space to do so safely, and after checking the car's mirrors and blind spots for other traffic. Given the observations, the ego vehicle should assess the speed and trajectory of the large vehicle ahead and either prepare to safely overtake it using the right lane or adjust speed to follow at a safe distance if overtaking is not possible or safe due to the adjacent SUV. Maintain a cautious approach speed in case the oversized vehicle makes unexpected movements. Additionally, be prepared for potential merging into the right lane if the left lane is closed ahead due to the indicated barrier. Monitor the SUV's position to ensure a safe lane change can be made if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance behind the silver SUV and be prepared to adjust speed according to the large industrial vehicle's speed and lane occupancy. Monitor the surroundings for any changes in road conditions or actions by the industrial vehicle that may require the ego vehicle to slow down or change lanes. Do not attempt to change lanes to the left where the barriers are present. Stay vigilant for any signs, signals, or changes in traffic flow."
