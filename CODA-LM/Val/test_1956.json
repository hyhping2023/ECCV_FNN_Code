        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a noticeable presence of a yellow construction truck ahead in the same lane as our vehicle and traveling in the same direction. The presence of this truck is particularly significant for the self-driving vehicle as it dictates the driving pace and requires the autonomous system to maintain a cautious speed. The large size of the truck has the potential to obstruct the road view, making it essential for the self-driving vehicle to take cautious maneuvers.\n\nAdditionally, a green trash can is noted on the roadside to the left of our autonomous vehicle. While it is not directly on the road, there is a risk that it could be knocked onto the driving path due to various external factors such as wind. Consequently, the autonomous driving system should monitor this potential hazard closely, as it may lead to pedestrian activities or unexpected debris on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from construction trucks, and be ready to adjust your speed depending on the truck's speed and the behavior of the tricycle ahead. Be on the alert for potential obstacles on the road, such as debris. Regularly check your rearview mirrors to spot overtaking traffic and prepare to move to the right when safe and legal, to give way to other vehicles. There is no immediate need to act regarding garbage bins, but remain vigilant. Monitor changes in the traffic flow in the left lane. Continue to drive at a speed that is appropriate for the road conditions and in compliance with traffic laws. The vehicle should be prepared to slow down due to road conditions and potential actions of the vehicle ahead, which is green, and stay alert for any unexpected hazards.",

Since the construction vehicle appears to occupy a portion of the ego car's lane, it is imperative that the ego car reduces speed and prepares to stop or navigate around the construction vehicle, while ensuring the oncoming lane is clear before attempting to pass. The presence of the construction vehicle suggests that there may be construction work underway, so the driver should be cautious of potential roadwork, workers, and additional construction equipment in the vicinity.",
