The presence of this truck requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance, ensuring there is sufficient time to react to any sudden stops or movements from the truck, which may be erratic if it brakes or turns suddenly.\n\nThere is also a red and white rectangular sign on the left side of the road that appears to be informational. Although the text is not clear, the ego vehicle should be alert to any potential instructions or warnings it may convey.\n\nAdditionally, metal barriers are observed on both sides of the road, separating the sidewalk from the roadway and preventing any immediate lateral maneuvers by the ego vehicle. These barriers indicate that crossing into oncoming traffic, making a U-turn, or overtaking is not possible, which limits the potential maneuvers of the ego car."

Additionally, keep in the lane and follow the traffic flow as barriers prevent any crossing over or U-turns. Watch for any informational signs that become readable upon getting closer. Be prepared to adjust speed or stop safely if the truck slows down or stops, and be vigilant for any turns the truck might make. Be ready to adjust speed or position while maintaining safe driving practices. Monitor the road for any changes in conditions or unexpected events that could require the ego car to adjust speed or change lanes. Continuous observation for any signs, changes in traffic light status, or pedestrian activity beyond the truck is critical."
