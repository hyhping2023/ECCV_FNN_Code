Additionally, there are several pedestrians on the right side who appear to be walking away from the road, and they don't seem to pose an immediate traffic risk but should be watched in case someone moves towards the road unexpectedly. No visible traffic signs or lights are affecting the current drive, indicating that the ego vehicle should rely on standard road rules and the driver's knowledge of the area. There are also no visible traffic cones, suggesting no current roadwork or lane closures ahead. A yellow curb barrier on the right separates the road from the pedestrian area, marking the boundary of the driving lane. Lastly, there are scattered reflective objects and debris by the barrier on the road's right side; while these may be minor obstacles, they could be a hazard to the vehicle's tires and should be avoided while maintaining the lane."
