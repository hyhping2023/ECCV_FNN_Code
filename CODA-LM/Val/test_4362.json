A white car is positioned on the left side of the intersection and appears to be waiting due to the red light. This suggests that we should also be ready to stop or yield, as it's likely that the traffic light facing our direction is also red.\n2. A car is seen approaching the intersection from a distance on the right. We need to monitor this vehicle's speed and direction as it may affect the dynamics of the intersection if it intends to cross or turn.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A dog is spotted crossing the road from right to left on the zebra crossing. Due to the dog's presence on our path, the autonomous vehicle must be prepared to yield or stop to prevent a potential collision.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. A red traffic light is observed for the lanes going straight ahead and for the left turn directly in front of the autonomous vehicle, which commands the vehicle to halt completely at the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that impact the driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the red light in your own lane, you should come to a complete stop at the marked line. As the traffic light changes, pay attention to whether stationary vehicles are moving, be prepared to yield, and be ready to stop again for dogs crossing the road. You may proceed when the traffic light turns green and after ensuring that all obstacles on the road, including dogs, have been cleared. Before passing through the intersection on a green light, it is important to check the driving intentions of other vehicles.",
