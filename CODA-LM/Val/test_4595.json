        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a large crane truck to the right of the ego vehicle, occupying the adjacent lane and extending into the ego vehicle's lane. The size and position of the crane truck could restrict the ego car's maneuverability and limit visibility of road signs or other road users. Additionally, ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, there is a motorcyclist positioned in a nearby lane. Given that motorcyclists are more vulnerable than car occupants, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and pay careful attention to the motorcyclist's movements.\n\nAbove the roadway, there are directional signs that inform drivers about lane directions and available turns. These traffic signs are crucial for the ego vehicle's navigation and could influence which lane the driver chooses. Also, a traffic light positioned ahead displays a green signal, suggesting that the ego car is permitted to continue driving. Despite this, the driver is advised to stay alert to the traffic conditions and actions of other road users.\n\nThere is also a single traffic cone on the right side of the ego vehicle, near the crane truck, which could signify road works or a potential hazard. It is important for the ego car to avoid the traffic cone and to be cautious of any further road works signs or detour indications that might be present. There are no barriers or other objects reported in this scene."

Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for any potential maneuvers by the crane truck, such as turning or extending its arm, and react accordingly while maintaining a safe distance."
