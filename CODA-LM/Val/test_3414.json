The ego car should take into account that this stationary vehicle reduces the effective width of the drivable road surface. Additionally, there are large spools of cable located to the right side of the road, behind the parked car. Although these objects are currently off the road, the proximity is close enough that the ego car should monitor them to quickly react if they were to move onto the roadway unexpectedly. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are observed in the image."

It is oversized relative to typical vehicle wheels and is likely there for aesthetic purposes or as part of a display. Its presence does not directly influence the future driving behavior of the ego car, as it is not an obstacle in the roadway or a directional sign that would provide instructions for navigation. The ego car would therefore continue unaffected by this object.",

Perform this maneuver while ensuring the ego car remains within the lane markers. Additionally, while the spools of cable do not directly obstruct the road, the ego car should be prepared to react if the situation changes. Continue to monitor the road ahead for any dynamic changes and maintain a speed that allows for safe reaction to unexpected obstacles."
