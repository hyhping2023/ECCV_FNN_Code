        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two main categories of road users and objects that significantly impact the driving behavior of the ego car. First, there is a stationary vehicle parked on the right side of the road. It's noticeable that its rear lights are visible, which might suggest that the vehicle is currently idle or unoccupied. The presence of this parked vehicle narrows the available width of the road, necessitating the ego car to adjust its path to ensure safe passage without coming too close to the stationary vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, reflective traffic cones have been spotted on the right side of the lane as well. These cones likely indicate a construction zone or some form of roadworks ahead. This scenario advises the ego car to lower its speed and remain vigilant for possible obstructions or workers present on the road, ensuring the safety of all parties involved. The arrangement and presence of these road users and objects underline the importance of adaptability in the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles in response to varying road conditions and obstacles."

Its presence on the road may be an obstacle for vehicles and could potentially lead to hazardous situations if drivers do not notice it in time.
