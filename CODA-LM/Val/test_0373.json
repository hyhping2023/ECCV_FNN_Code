        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, several road users and elements have been listed, affecting the driving behavior of the ego car. Starting with vehicles, there's a red forklift truck positioned to the right of the main vehicle, partly obstructing the adjacent lane. Forklifts are considered potential hazards as their unexpected start or turn could necessitate the main vehicle to slow down or change lanes to prevent a collision.\n\nFurthermore, among vulnerable road users, a person wearing a high-visibility jacket is noted standing on the road near the forklift, facing towards the main vehicle. The presence of this person on the road is a safety concern because they might move unpredictably. As such, it's crucial to proceed with caution and be ready to stop at any moment to ensure safety.\n\nTraffic lights in the scene display a green signal for going straight, which generally indicates that the vehicle is allowed to proceed through the intersection, assuming it is safe to do so. This implies that despite the presence of potential hazards, the vehicle can continue moving without the need to halt for traffic signal reasons.\n\nAdditionally, a green guardrail is observed on the right side of the vehicle, acting as a separation between the road and a construction or closed-off area. This setup hints at the possibility of road construction or other obstructions adjacent to the vehicle's lane, potentially leading to impediments or the narrowing of lanes.\n\nThe scene also includes other objects, such as a green tarp covering the forklift. This detail suggests the presence of goods or indicates ongoing work, reinforcing the idea that the nearby area might be a construction zone or a site of active work. The covered forklift stresses the importance of drivers being more vigilant and exceedingly cautious when passing by, as it implies active or imminent use of the forklift, which could present additional hazards.\n\nTherefore, this comprehensive summary of the traffic image showcases a variety of elements and road users that influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior, underlining the necessity for heightened awareness and caution in the presence of construction-related activities and unpredictable road users."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from forklifts and pedestrians on the road; it is advisable to slow down and be prepared to stop at any time. Drivers should be alert to any movements of forklifts and pedestrians, as well as changes in traffic lights or new road construction signs when approaching. The presence of obstacles indicates ongoing construction, so drivers should also be vigilant for possible road workers and signs indicating changes in traffic patterns. While the traffic light is green, and your vehicle may continue, you must exercise extra caution due to nearby road users and potential hazards.",

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a construction vehicle, commonly known as a forklift, with visible lift forks and an operator compartment. Due to its presence on or near the roadway, the ego car must remain cautious and may need to adjust speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance from the construction activity. The movements of this type of vehicle can be unpredictable, and it may enter or cross the driving lane unexpectedly, which can influence the ego car to slow down and proceed with increased awareness.",
