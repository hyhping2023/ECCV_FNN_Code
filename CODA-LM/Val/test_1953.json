Overhead, slightly to the left, a traffic light shows green, guiding the traffic flow and permitting vehicles to proceed safely. Traffic cones are arranged near a checkpoint on the left, delineating an area to avoid and indicating potential hazards. White and blue striped barriers are on both sides of the road, prominently on the left, guiding traffic through a narrower pathway. Additionally, there's a police booth with a person nearby, indicating the presence of law enforcement and requiring the ego vehicle to exercise caution due to the person's proximity."
