        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several categories of road users and objects are present, each influencing the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe scene includes a row of parked vehicles along the left side of the road, occupying designated parking spaces. This situation limits the available road width for the autonomous vehicle and poses a risk of concealing pedestrians or other road users that may unexpectedly enter the driving path.\n\nAdditionally, vulnerable road users are present in the form of construction workers dressed in high-visibility clothing and a police officer, gathered in the middle of the road ahead. Their presence is indicative of ongoing road construction or an accident, necessitating the autonomous vehicle to be prepared to stop or to proceed with caution, possibly taking a detour.\n\nTraffic lights in the scene also play a critical role. The traffic light visible ahead is red, signaling the vehicle to stop at the intersection until it turns green and it is safe to proceed.\n\nThe road is further complicated by the presence of traffic cones on the right side, used to guide the flow of traffic and indicating a construction area or road closure ahead. This requires the vehicle to adjust its path in accordance with the new traffic flow, ensuring safe passage.\n\nBarriers have been placed on the left side of the road, likely made of concrete or other materials, signaling that a section of the road or adjacent areas are impassable. This may cause vehicles to merge right, potentially leading to congestion.\n\nLastly, the scene is cluttered with various objects such as plants and building materials scattered on the right side of the road. These objects serve as obstacles that the autonomous vehicle must skillfully navigate around to prevent any damage or accidents.\n\nOverall, this traffic scene demands a high level of awareness and adaptability from the autonomous vehicle, necessitating the careful navigation of parked vehicles, compliance with traffic light signals, attention to vulnerable road users, and avoidance of physical obstacles such as traffic cones, barriers, and miscellaneous debris to ensure safe passage."

    "driving_suggestion": "The lead vehicle should slow down and cautiously navigate around workers, following the direction indicated by traffic cones. At the same time, it is necessary to remain vigilant and pay attention to the hand signals of traffic police or construction personnel. If a lane is partially closed due to workers or obstacles, the lead vehicle should prepare to merge into the open lane when it is safe to do so, signaling to other traffic participants. It is advised to maintain a safe distance from vehicles parked on the left to prevent sudden door openings or pedestrians emerging unexpectedly from between vehicles. Vehicles should also keep a safe distance from parked vehicles to be ready for their sudden movements. Moreover, vehicles should be alert to traffic signals that are currently red, and be prepared for sudden changes due to road construction. The lead vehicle should slow down and safely pass through the area, maintain a lower speed due to reduced traction from wet conditions, and be prepared to stop or yield to people on the road.",
