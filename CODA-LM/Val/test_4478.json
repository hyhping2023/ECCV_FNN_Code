The presence of this SUV necessitates maintaining a safe following distance as it dictates when it's safe to proceed or stop based on its movements.\n   - **Opposing lanes**: Multiple vehicles, including white, gray, and blue cars, are traveling in the opposite direction. Although they are in opposing lanes, they should be monitored for any unexpected movements, like swerving into the ego car's lane.\n   - **Left and right lanes**: Various vehicles in adjacent lanes are also traveling in the same direction. These vehicles need to be watched closely as they could potentially change lanes, requiring a response from the ego car.\n\n2. **Traffic signs**:\n   - **Directional sign above the road**: This sign indicates lanes and directions ahead, which the ego car must use to stay in the correct lane for its intended route. This helps the car anticipate upcoming exits or lane changes.\n   - **Blue traffic sign next to a stationary Toyota SUV**: This sign indicates an upcoming right turn, suggesting an intersection or junction where vehicles may merge onto the current road, requiring increased attentiveness and potential yielding from the ego vehicle.\n\n3. **Traffic cones**:\n   - **Orange traffic cones on the right side of the road**: These cones indicate that a section of the lane is not available, necessitating a potential merge to the left for the ego car. The cones help guide the ego vehicle to stay within the travel lane and avoid the shoulder or any obstructions.\n\n4. **Other objects**:\n   - **Grey electricity box and metal barrier on the right sidewalk**: While these fixed objects do not directly influence the ego car's path, being aware of them is important in case of a road departure.\n   - **Manhole cover on the road ahead**: Located in the ego vehicle's lane, the manhole cover represents an uneven surface that needs monitoring as it can affect vehicle control, although it doesnâ€™t require evasive action.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers are present in the image."

Stay vigilant for any changes in the opposing traffic that could affect the ego car's travel lane. Maintain safe following distance behind the stationary SUV, and be prepared to stop or proceed based on its movements. Monitor oncoming traffic for situational awareness but focus on the lead car's actions. Follow the lane markings and avoid the marked shoulder area where the traffic cones are placed. Be aware of the indicated right turn and prepare to respond to merging traffic as necessary. Proceed with caution when the SUV in front starts moving or if the traffic situation changes, ensuring to obey all prevailing traffic rules and regulations. Maintain a safe following distance behind the black Toyota SUV ahead, monitor the surrounding lanes for vehicles that may enter the lane, be aware of the traffic cones to the right and be prepared to merge left if necessary. Additionally, watch out for changing road conditions due to shadows from trees and remain observant for any potential hazards obscured by them. Preemptively plan for any necessary lane changes by observing the blue direction sign and adjust speed accordingly to the flow of traffic."
