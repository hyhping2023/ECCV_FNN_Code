There is a blue car traveling ahead in the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this vehicle could impact the ego car's speed and lane choice, especially if the blue car were to change lanes or adjust speed.\n\nAdditionally, yellow and red traffic cones have been set up along the median, serving as a physical barrier between the lanes of opposing traffic. These cones signal that the ego car should stay in its current lane and approach with caution, possibly due to road work or other hazards that might be present.\n\nMoreover, a continuous green metal barrier is found along the left side of the road, delineating the edge of the highway. This barrier is crucial as it prevents vehicles from crossing over into the oncoming traffic lanes, ensuring that the ego car follows the road closely without any deviations to the left.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects have been noted in this particular image, indicating their absence from the scene or their irrelevance to the ego car's immediate driving decisions."
