As these vehicles are in the same lane and there are no signs of them stopping or slowing down dramatically, they may not presently influence immediate driving decisions. However, there are fragments on the right side of the road, including what appears to be trash bags and scattered waste. This debris can pose a risk, necessitating autonomous vehicles to navigate around these objects to avoid potential damage or danger."

Due to poor visibility and wet road surfaces, it is recommended to increase the following distance and prepare for gentle braking. At the same time, given the limited visibility and unclear road conditions, full use of headlights should be made to improve visibility, and one should be ready to stop or maneuver around unexpected obstacles at any time. If traffic signs or signals are unclear, the vehicle should rely on any available map data for navigation and comply with traffic regulations.",
