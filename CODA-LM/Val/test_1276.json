Additionally, several vehicles are visible in adjacent lanes and further ahead, some with brake lights on, indicating slow or stopped traffic and suggesting congested conditions that need cautious navigation.\n\nSeveral vulnerable road users are present, including construction workers identifiable by their reflective vests working near machinery on the right side of the road, necessitating cautious driving to ensure their safety. A cyclist is on the right side, moving across the front of the ego vehicle, directly affecting the drivable path and posing a safety consideration for immediate driving decisions.\n\nIn the distance, traffic lights are showing green, indicating that through traffic may proceed when safe, particularly once the congestion ahead clears. Orange traffic cones on the right separate the construction zone from the driving lanes, indicating that the ego car should not cross into the sectioned-off area for road work. Temporary construction barriers are lined up along the left side of the road, indicating ongoing construction work and suggesting potential impacts on traffic flow and the need for the ego car to maintain a safe distance.\n\nLastly, construction equipment, specifically an orange excavator, is present within the construction zone on the left side. While it is not an immediate hazard, it suggests active construction work and could be a source of sudden movement or obstruction."
