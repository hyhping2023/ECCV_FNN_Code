On the right side, there is a large orange crane truck that is stationary and partially blocking the lane next to our vehicle, necessitating a merge to the left to avoid it. Additionally, there is a blue double-decker bus parked at a bus bay to the left and ahead, which is not obstructing the lane but could potentially re-enter the traffic flow, requiring vigilance. Directly ahead, a red bus is stopped perpendicular to our vehicle, possibly discharging passengers, which could lead to pedestrians crossing in front of our vehicle.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user in the scene: a cyclist dressed in pink is directly in front of us, in the middle of the right lane, moving in the same direction as the traffic. This requires our vehicle to either slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe distance from the cyclist.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there is a white fence that serves as a barrier, separating the oncoming traffic lane from our lane, ensuring that our vehicle stays within the correct lane and does not drift into oncoming traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive with caution, preparing to change lanes to the left to avoid the crane truck, and pay attention to the movements of cyclists, giving them enough space. Be alert to any signals from the bus, which may indicate it is re-entering the traffic flow. As the traffic light status cannot be determined from the image, be prepared to stop if necessary when approaching the intersection, following standard traffic rules and signals. Since the crane truck partially occupies this lane, the vehicle should slow down and be ready to stop or safely bypass. Additionally, the vehicle must be cautious of the red bus and be prepared for potential pedestrians crossing the street. Space should be provided for the cyclist ahead, and be ready to change lanes or overtake with sufficient clearance. Overall, maintain low speed, be prepared to stop when necessary, and monitor the traffic flow to adapt to further changes. The vehicle should first slow down to ensure a safe following distance from the cyclist. Considering the position of the truck, if there is a clear and safe lane on the left, the vehicle should signal, check mirrors and blind spots, then change lanes to pass the cyclist and truck. Continuously monitor oncoming traffic to prevent any unsafe crossing or turning. If intending to turn left, the driver must be cautious of potential blind spots caused by the bus and wait for a safe gap in the oncoming traffic.",
