        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, a large construction vehicle, specifically a concrete pump truck, is occupying the lane, appearing stationary or moving slowly. This truck is covered in dirt and carrying building materials, blocking the road and potentially preparing for operations affecting multiple lanes. Additionally, on the right side of the image, a white car is in the adjacent lane, positioned perpendicular to our vehicle. Monitoring this car's distance and trajectory is essential to anticipate potential lane changes or other actions that might impact our car's operation.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the left, a pedestrian is walking perpendicularly, moving away from the vehicle. The vehicle should be prepared to stop and yield to pedestrians crossing the street.\n\nMoreover, temporary blue and white traffic barriers are present, separating the flow of vehicles from the central median and guiding vehicles into designated lanes. These barriers define the driving space's boundaries, indicating areas where pedestrian crossings are unlikely."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and maintain a safe distance from the concrete pump truck, always being prepared to stop or give way in response to any possible unpredictable movements. Reduce speed and be ready to stop or yield to accommodate the maneuvers of large vehicles that may be operating. Keep a safe distance from the white car ahead on the right, and continuously monitor the cyclist for any sudden lane changes or stops. Even if pedestrians on the left sidewalk currently pose no direct threat to vehicle traffic, remain vigilant. Do not attempt to overtake the truck until you have a clear understanding of its intentions and ensured there is sufficient safe space. Paying attention to traffic obstacles is also important for staying in the correct lane.",
