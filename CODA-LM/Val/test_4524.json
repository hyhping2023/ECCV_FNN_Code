It occupies parts of the travel lane and is equipped with a visible yellow crane arm, red and white caution markings, and blinking lights on top. This construction vehicle's size and position significantly impact the navigable space for the ego car and could slow down or halt traffic, possibly necessitating a lane change.\n\nAdditionally, several cars are present in the adjacent lanes, including a black or dark-colored sedan to the left of the ego car. The partial visibility of these vehicles is crucial for the ego car to consider, especially if a lane change is needed to navigate around the construction vehicle or other potential obstacles.\n\nTo the right of the scene, a cyclist is visible, either riding along the road or on the sidewalk, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's presence can affect traffic dynamics, as they might enter the road, influencing the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes, speed adjustments, and maintaining a safe distance.\n\nNo traffic lights are discernible in the image, which means the ego car must rely on other visual cues, such as road markings or the traffic flow, to make driving decisions.\n\nLastly, there is significant glare from sunlight filtering through the trees, which affects visibility. This reduced visibility could make it difficult to detect traffic signals, other road users, or changes in traffic conditions, necessitating careful attention and slower speeds by the ego car."
