A black car is parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction, which might obstruct the road or cause accidents when doors are opened or passengers disembark. An SUV is parked sideways ahead on the right, with its rear extending into the traffic lane, reducing the available width for driving and posing a risk for overtaking vehicles. Lastly, a light-colored car is moving away on the left lane, requiring attention due to its impact on the oncoming traffic pattern.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, pedestrians are walking on the left side of the road by the roadside, presenting a risk if they suddenly enter the roadway. \n\nFor traffic signage, an overhead signboard gives information about the upcoming road layout, crucial for autonomous vehicle navigation and lane-changing decisions. Additionally, a triangular warning sign alerts to an approaching intersection and the presence of pedestrians, indicating the need for increased alertness and reduced speed.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of a sedan, hinting at possible road construction or obstructions ahead, necessitating cautious driving. \n\nLastly, a small white object near the traffic cones on the road could become an obstacle, necessitating vehicles to be prepared for evasive maneuvers.\n\nNo traffic lights or barriers were noted in the scene, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the current traffic situation."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a moderate speed and a safe distance from all other vehicles, especially from the white vehicle on the left and the SUV with the protruding rear that may merge into the traffic flow. Reduce speed and be prepared to stop for pedestrians who may try to cross the road, particularly those walking along the roadside. Positioning should take into account parked vehicles and any possible debris near them. Continuous monitoring of these situations, including parked black vehicles that may pose unexpected hazards, will contribute to safely navigating through this traffic scenario. Moreover, respect traffic signs and be prepared to respond to changes indicated by traffic cones. If it is safe to do so without affecting nearby traffic, it is advisable to slightly move to the left to avoid small objects on the road near the traffic cones.",
