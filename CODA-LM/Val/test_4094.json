This vehicle does not pose a direct danger to our vehicle, but there is a potential risk if it moves unexpectedly or if a passenger opens a door into our lane. Additionally, a traffic cone is located to the right of the parked car on the sidewalk, indicating potential danger or road construction, which may require our vehicle to alter its route to avoid them. Furthermore, there is a red fire hydrant on the right side of the sidewalk. While fire hydrants do not directly affect the driving path, their location should be noted to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between them and the vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "In light of the identified road users and objects, the vehicle should proceed with caution due to the slippery road surface and decelerate accordingly. The presence of traffic cones suggests that maneuvers may be required; thus, it is advised to be prepared to adjust the lane position when necessary, while paying attention to parked vehicles and fire hydrants on the right. Continue to monitor any unexpected movements from parked vehicles and ensure that no road users are in the blind spots before changing lanes, as it is an important safety measure. Remain vigilant of cyclists and avoid parking in unauthorized locations. The existence of traffic cones may indicate nearby road work or obstacles, so be ready to adjust the driving path accordingly. Maintain a safe passing distance from cyclists and be observant for further road condition change indicators. Allow ample space for motorcyclists ahead, and stay alert for pedestrians or road workers who may emerge due to traffic cones and pinch-point situations. Adjust speed accordingly and be prepared to stop when necessary.",

It is a two-wheeled motor vehicle with a step-through frame and a platform for the operator's feet. The presence of this vehicle suggests that the driver of the ego car should be cautious and maintain a safe distance when passing by, in case the moped's driver decides to enter traffic abruptly. Furthermore, this moped should be considered when making turns or lane changes in its vicinity to avoid any potential collisions.",
