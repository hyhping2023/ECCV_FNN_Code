However, there are traffic signs which comprise a set of informational and directional signs positioned on yellow barricades. These signs signal the presence of detours and traffic re-routing that lie ahead, thereby informing the ego vehicle that it must be prepared to alter its driving path according to the new traffic patterns and follow a detour or re-route.\n\nAdditionally, the road includes yellow metal barricades placed horizontally, completely obstructing the road. These physical barriers serve as a clear indication that the road is closed to vehicular traffic, which means that the ego vehicle will not be able to continue traveling forward on this route.\n\nFurthermore, there are white bags placed at the base of these barriers. These bags, potentially filled with sand or construction materials, seem to serve the purpose of stabilizing the barriers or demarcating the boundary of a work area. Their presence suggests that there may be road work or temporary construction activity occurring in the vicinity. There are no traffic lights or traffic cones noted in this scene."
