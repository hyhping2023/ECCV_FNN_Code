        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scenario, multiple road users and objects are present, influencing driving decisions.\n\nThere is a silver sedan driving on the left lane in the opposite direction of traffic, positioned slightly forward with respect to the host vehicle. The proximity and potential maneuvers of the sedan, such as speed changes or lane switching, dictate that the host vehicle must be wary in order to react accordingly.\n\nSimultaneously, a beige bus is also observed traveling in the opposite direction on the left side of the road. Although it is moving away from the host vehicle, its large size warrants caution, as unexpected movements could obstruct visibility or the host's travel path.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist hugging the right curb, moving parallel to the host vehicle. This cyclist demands attention to preempt any sudden deviations from their path. Additionally, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog is seen crossing the road at a distance in front of an oncoming bus; their actions require careful observation due to the potential risk should they alter their path towards the host vehicle's lane. Furthermore, a separate cyclist and motorcyclist are utilizing a bike lane beside the host's vehicle, necessitating diligent surveillance for any potential lane mergers or obstacles they may face.\n\nRegarding infrastructure, orange traffic cones delineate the side of the bike lane, signifying construction or roadway disruptions. This commands a safe distance be kept from the cones and awareness for pedestrians and cyclists navigating around them. A metal fence runs alongside the road, which confines lateral movement and calls for increased awareness of pedestrians and cyclists adjacent to the roadway.\n\nAdditional elements of the environment such as a closed gate with parked bicycles and a noticeable surveillance camera suggest a residential setting. This infers the possibility of increased pedestrian and vehicular activity, emphasizing the need for preparedness for crossing individuals or vehicles. Lastly, the presence of a trash can next to the right-side sidewalk, near the metal fence, although not an immediate hazard, signifies an area requiring close observation to forestall any spontaneous disruptions from pedestrians or animals."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a safe distance behind the silver sedan, monitor speed, and be prepared to respond to any lane changes or speed adjustments by the sedan. Given the proximity of the cyclist, overtaking should be done with caution to ensure that there is ample safe space. Pay attention to pedestrians crossing the road with dogs and be ready to stop at any time in case they may step into our vehicle's path. Traffic cones indicate that our vehicle should stay in its lane and remain alert to any instructions or changes in the road layout ahead. Maintain a cautious speed and be ready to react to potential actions from cyclists and motorcyclists. Watch for any signs that pedestrians with dogs might enter the lane. Continue to stay in the correct lane and if planning to turn soon, observe traffic signs to ensure the necessary lane positioning.",
