The nearest one is a white car that is not showing any brake or indicator lights, and the second vehicle is a bit further ahead, only partially visible from the ego car's perspective. The ego car must reduce its speed and remain vigilant for any unexpected movements or doors opening from these parked vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there is a single traffic cone placed on the left side of the ego car's lane, roughly in the middle. This cone indicates there might be a road hazard or a work area ahead, which means the ego car should proceed with caution and be ready to adjust its lane position if necessary.\n\nLastly, there is a light source directly ahead of the ego vehicle, which could be a streetlight. This light may affect the driver's visibility and make it harder to spot potential obstacles. The glare from bright lights at night requires the driver to be extra cautious and pay greater attention to the road."

The driver should verify that the sedan is not moving and that there is enough clearance on the left to pass the parked vehicle without driving into oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver should adjust their visor or use the car's sunshade if the light ahead causes excessive glare making it difficult to spot potential hazards. Continuous monitoring of the road for any moving vehicles, pedestrians, or new obstacles is critical. Be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully if a door opens from the parked cars or if there is a road obstruction near the traffic cone. Given the low visibility, activate any necessary lights and ensure a heightened awareness of the environment."
