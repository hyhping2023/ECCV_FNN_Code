        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under observation, various road users and objects present a detailed scene for autonomous navigation. Firstly, there are two vehicles in the vicinity. One is described as a blue car situated parallel on the left side, signifying that this particular lane is occupied and thereby not advisable for undertaking maneuvers such as merging or overtaking. Similarly, a green sedan is spotted moving forward in the same direction on an adjacent lane, denoting the necessity for heightened awareness in anticipation of potential lane changes or its impact on the overarching traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk to the right of the vehicles is noted. Importantly, there seem to be no immediate signals of intent to cross the road from the pedestrian. However, it's crucial for vehicles to remain alert to any sudden pedestrian movements across the road, as yielding may become necessary.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scenario are currently green, situated at a distance. The green signal allows for progression, but there's a cautioned reminder to stay vigilant of the signal potentially changing or the movements of other road users that might necessitate a signal change, thereby urging a cautious approach.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic cone is visible on the right side, possibly indicating a zone of hazard or ongoing work. This serves as a cue for vehicles to navigate carefully, ensuring avoidance of the cone and adherence to safety protocols.\n\nIn this scenario, no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects are reported, focusing the summary solely on the described vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and a traffic cone, each contributing to the complexity of autonomous vehicle navigation and the intricate balance of safety, awareness, and adaptability required in such dynamic environments."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the green car ahead. If the car in front slows down or stops, be prepared to decelerate or stop at any moment, and watch out for pedestrians on the right. Traffic cones indicate the presence of hazards or construction, so if it is safe and legal, our vehicle should change lanes to the left lane to avoid obstacles and proceed with caution. When passing vehicles that are parked on the side of the road, drive carefully to ensure not veering into oncoming traffic. At the same time, continue to monitor pedestrians on the sidewalk and be prepared to stop or yield if they enter the roadway. Maintain a safe driving speed to anticipate unseen hazards and be aware of possible changes in the flow of traffic. Drive with caution, paying close attention to pedestrians that may enter the road from the right. Observe the traffic lights ahead, and prepare to stop. Traffic conditions require moderate speed and be ready to slightly adjust the lane position to the left at any time to avoid parked tricycles on the right while respecting the right-of-way of adjacent lanes.",
