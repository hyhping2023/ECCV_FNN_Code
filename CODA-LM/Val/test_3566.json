Because the truck appears blurry, it seems to be in motion, and there are no visible rear safety indicators or reverse lights to suggest otherwise.",
                "explanation": "Considering the size of the truck, it may obstruct the view of our vehicle, and if it suddenly changes lanes or stops, it could also pose a risk. Our vehicle should pay special attention to the proximity and size of the truck when changing lanes or adjusting speed."

It could also signify traffic merging or lane shifting due to road construction or obstacles. This may foreshadow road construction ahead, potential detours, or lane reductions, for which the vehicle should be prepared."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image we're analyzing, there are two key elements that stand out and could potentially impact driving behavior for autonomous vehicles.\n\nFirstly, there is a large white tank truck positioned on the left side of the image. This truck is in motion, as indicated by its blurry appearance, and lacks visible rear safety indicators or lights that would suggest it's slowing down or stopping. The size and proximity of the truck could obstruct the view for our vehicle. Moreover, if the truck were to suddenly change lanes or come to an abrupt stop, it could pose a significant risk. Therefore, it's crucial for our vehicle to be vigilant of the truck's movements, especially when considering changing lanes or adjusting speed to maintain safe travel.\n\nSecondly, in the bottom right corner of the image, there's a blue obstacle near the road, possibly indicating ongoing road construction or a portion of the road being closed off. The presence of these obstacles might lead to a reduction in lane width, the emergence of potential hazards, or the need for traffic to merge or change lanes. This situation suggests there could be road construction, potential detours, or lane reductions ahead. As such, our vehicle needs to be prepared for these changes, possibly adjusting speed or changing lanes in anticipation of the altered road conditions.\n\nThese elements in the traffic scene are critical for autonomous driving systems to detect and respond to, ensuring safe and efficient travel through varying traffic environments."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should maintain a safe distance from tanker trucks, remaining alert to any unexpected movements, especially when the truck shows signs of turning or changing lanes. Overtaking should only be considered when the road ahead is clear and safe. Moreover, drivers should stay vigilant about blue obstacles and be ready to respond to any changes in traffic. Observing the road environment, which includes signs and road markings that may be partially obscured by the truck, is crucial to get further instructions or notice of lane changes due to roadwork. Your vehicle's speed should be adjusted according to visibility, road conditions, and potential hazards related to the truck and obstacles. Particularly on wet and slippery roads, maintain a safe distance from oil tankers. Stay alert to any roadwork signs or changes in traffic patterns caused by blue obstacles on the right side. Adjust speed to ensure safety depending on the likely slippery conditions and the proximity of large vehicles. Given that the presence of trucks and obstacles might indicate roadwork ahead, your vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop or merge left if necessary. Keep a safe distance from trucks and be mindful of any workers or additional signs that could provide further information about road conditions.",

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, is partially visible. Its rotating drum indicates it is designed to mix and transport cement. For the ego car, this implies the need for increased caution due to the size and potential blind spots of the truck. Given its position, the ego car should ensure there's enough space between it and the truck to prevent any contact and to prepare for any unexpected maneuvers the truck might make.",
