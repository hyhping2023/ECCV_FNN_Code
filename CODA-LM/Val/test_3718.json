        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two notable vehicles. The first is a large yellow vehicle with reflective strips, potentially engaged in road construction or maintenance, which is positioned in the right lane ahead of your vehicle. This vehicle's presence disrupts the normal flow of traffic, suggesting that it might be necessary to either change lanes or reduce speed to ensure safety. The second vehicle is a white sedan in the left lane, traveling in the opposite direction to our vehicle. While the sedan isn't directly impeding traffic flow, autonomous vehicles should still keep a safe distance and closely monitor its movements to prevent any potential incidents. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Firstly, one should determine the status of the traffic light applicable to their lane and understand whether it's their turn to proceed. If the left lane is moving and it's possible to change lanes legally and safely without hindering other vehicles, one may switch lanes to avoid stationary maintenance vehicles in the right lane. If changing lanes is not possible or safe, one should prepare to stop at a red light, maintaining a safe distance from the maintenance vehicle and any other traffic that may stop. Keep a safe distance from the truck directly ahead to allow sufficient reaction time for any sudden stops or turns. Continue to monitor the potential lane changes of the white sedan in the adjacent lane. Proceed through the intersection while watching the green traffic light, but prepare to stop if the light turns yellow, especially considering the limited visibility behind the truck. It's crucial to pay close attention to speed limits and anticipate the changes in light phases, as one might not be able to cross the intersection before the light turns red, depending on the distance to the stop line and the timing of the light.",

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial vehicle, commonly known as a truck, is directly ahead on the road. This vehicle typically carries goods and has a sizable body, making it slower to maneuver and requiring additional space to turn or stop. The presence of the truck will require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to account for the larger vehicle's increased stopping distance and reduce potential blind spots caused by the truck's size.",
