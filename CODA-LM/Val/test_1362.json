        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the ego vehicle is following a cement truck traveling in the same lane ahead of it. The cement truck is identified as a construction vehicle and may perform unpredictable maneuvers, such as slowing down or stopping unexpectedly, possibly dropping debris which could be hazardous to surrounding traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there are two cars adjacent to the ego vehicle: a dark car in the left lane and a white car in the right lane, both slightly ahead. These vehicles form part of the overall traffic flow and their movements, such as potential lane changes or braking, could influence the driving choices of the ego car.\n\nComplicating the driving environment is a distant traffic light, which is difficult to discern due to glare from the sun. This adds a level of uncertainty as the ego car must be ready to halt if the light turns out to be red.\n\nFinally, there is a dustbin positioned by the sidewalk on the right roadside. While it does not pose an immediate danger, it's a variable to be aware of since unexpected factors could cause it to move into the road, presenting a potential risk."

Given its large size and the potential for cement or debris to fall from the rotating drum, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle to avoid any possible damage from spills or debris.

Be prepared to react to the movements of the surrounding cars and remain alert to the traffic light's condition, despite the sun glare. The ego car should drive defensively, especially given the proximity to larger vehicles and the possibility of limited visibility due to sun glare. Monitor the white sedan for any signs of a lane change which may require the ego car to adjust its positioning. Approach the traffic light cautiously, ready to stop if it turns out to be red. Stay alert to potential hazards but no immediate action required regarding the dustbin on the side of the road."
