A light blue car is traveling on the left side in the same direction as the ego car. This car could influence the ego car's lane-changing decisions or require the ego car to respond to any speed adjustments the blue car makes.\n2. A yellow motorcycle is ahead of the ego car in the same lane, which means the ego car should keep a safe distance due to the motorcycle's vulnerability and potential for sudden stops or turns.\n3. A three-wheeled vehicle is in the middle of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car and is heavily loaded with goods. This slow-moving vehicle might reduce traffic flow, necessitating the ego car to slow down or change lanes.\n4. A red food stall is stationary on the side of the road. It could attract pedestrians or start moving unexpectedly, so the ego car needs to be cautious.\n5. Multiple vehicles, including cars and motorbikes, are parked on the right side of the street, indicating a busy roadside. This situation could lead to pedestrians stepping out or doors opening, so the ego car must be cautious and prepared for unpredictable movements.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A person is next to the street carts on the right side, which could indicate activity that might lead to a pedestrian entering the roadway. The ego car should closely monitor this area for unexpected pedestrian crossings.\n2. A pedestrian dressed in a dark outfit is on the sidewalk on the right side, but they do not directly affect the ego vehicle's path as they are not on the road.\n3. A pedestrian is possibly interacting with the food stall on the right side of the road. Pedestrians near roadsides can be unpredictable, so caution is advised.\n4. Several individuals are around the three-wheeled motorcycle with the blue container, with one on the roadway, potentially obstructing or signaling to traffic. This could lead to unpredictable movements, requiring careful driving.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. There is a street sign indicating 'E WEN JIAN LANE [sic] of Shangshui RD' on the sidewalk to the right. While it does not provide immediate directional information, it helps locate the ego car within the road network.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. Street carts and possible debris are on the sidewalk to the right, suggesting potential pedestrian activity. The ego car must remain vigilant as pedestrians might step unexpectedly onto the road.\n2. Vehicles are parked on the side of the road to the left, which could obstruct the view of the road. The ego car needs to be vigilant for doors opening or vehicles pulling out.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
