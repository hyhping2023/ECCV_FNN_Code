        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several cars ahead with their taillights on, primarily in the right-hand lane, and they are spaced at varying distances from one another. These vehicles influence the driving behavior of our autonomous vehicle, as it must be prepared for potential sudden stops or lane changes. Additionally, there are vehicles parked on the right side of the road, partially blocking the right-hand lane. Our vehicle must keep a safe distance from these parked cars to prevent collisions and to allow for sufficient space to maneuver if one of the parked cars unexpectedly enters the traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, there are oncoming vehicles with high beams on in the opposite lane. The glare from these lights may impair visibility, so it is crucial for our vehicle to ensure it remains within its lane boundaries. Although there are no pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the scene, the autonomous vehicle should remain alert for the possible emergence of such vulnerable road users.\n\nWhile street lights are present, traffic signals are not visible in the image. In this situation, the autonomous vehicle should follow standard road usage rules. On the right side of the road, there are yellow and black traffic cones and barriers delineating the operational road from a construction or closed-off area. These indicate that the vehicle should stay in its current lane and be cautious of potential obstacles or road workers near the cones.\n\nLastly, due to the darkness, it is challenging to discern other objects, which necessitates increased vigilance and possibly a reduction in speed to safely handle unforeseen hazards."

    "driving_suggestion": "According to the traffic scene information, this vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, drive in the right lane to avoid parked cars and traffic cones on the left, and travel at a safe speed given the current visibility conditions, while always being vigilant for potentially suddenly appearing vulnerable road users or other objects. Use the headlights, and if not affecting oncoming traffic, high beams can be turned on appropriately to improve visibility. Additionally, monitor road obstacles to ensure safe navigation within the separated traffic lanes, and adjust driving behavior by slowing down and increasing the following distance according to the wet and slippery road conditions.",
