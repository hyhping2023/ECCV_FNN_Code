The truck has its rear lights illuminated, indicating it is operating at night. This truck's size and load could necessitate sudden changes in speed or direction, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential maneuvers. Additionally, the truck's proximity and large size could present challenges to safe overtaking and impact the ego car's visibility, braking distances, and maneuverability.\n\nFurther, a pair of green traffic lights is visible glowing above the truck on the right side, indicating that the lane is clear for the ego car to proceed. Despite this, the ego car should remain cautious due to the truck's presence."

It is characterized by its bulky structure and may carry heavy equipment or materials. The presence of this vehicle on the road, especially at night, indicates that there might be construction activity nearby.

The ego car should also adjust its speed to ensure adequate stopping distance given the reduced visibility conditions of nighttime driving. Use headlights as it is nighttime to ensure visibility. Observe any changes in the truck's taillights for braking or turning indicators. Be ready to slow down or stop if needed. Since the traffic light is green, there's no need to stop, but continue monitoring the truck's actions closely as it may slow down or change lanes. Avoid attempting to overtake until there is a clear and safe opportunity to do so, preferably with increased visibility of the road ahead. Use the vehicle's headlights appropriately to ensure the road ahead is well-illuminated without dazzling other road users."
