It is characterized by its robust structure and the visible excavating arm with a digging bucket. This vehicle is typically used for heavy-duty construction work, including digging, material handling, and demolition tasks. In the context of driving behavior for the ego car in this scenario, the presence of the construction vehicle may indicate ongoing road work or the possibility of the vehicle entering or exiting the roadway. The ego car should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance and being prepared for potential stops or slow-moving traffic. Furthermore, because construction vehicles can make unexpected maneuvers, the ego car should be vigilant for any signals or movements from the construction vehicle that could affect traffic flow.",

Overtaking should only be attempted if the opposite lane is clear and it's safe to do so. Pay attention to road markings and safety poles along the road to stay within the correct lane. Maintain a safe following distance behind the truck to ensure adequate reaction time and visibility. Be prepared to slow down if the truck makes unexpected maneuvers, such as turning or stopping. Keep an eye on the road markings and avoid passing the truck if the road narrows or if there are traffic signs indicating it is unsafe to do so. Continue monitoring the road state for any changes."
