The presence of this oncoming vehicle does not directly influence the ego car's behavior as it is in the appropriate lane for its direction of travel. However, it remains important for the ego car to monitor the oncoming traffic.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are positioned along the left edge of the carriageway, stretching into the distance and delineating a construction zone or road works. As a result, the ego vehicle should retain its place in the right lane and approach the area with heightened awareness for potential obstacles or personnel working around the cones.\n\nA sturdy metal barrier is installed beside the left lane, creating a clear separation between the construction zone and the active part of the road. This barrier further indicates that the ego car must remain in the right lane and be mindful of the restricted driving area.\n\nFurthermore, visible behind the barriers is construction equipment, likely an excavator, suggesting that road work is in progress. This necessitates that the ego car maintain vigilance and be ready to react to any unexpected incidents or debris that could be present in the vicinity of the construction site."
