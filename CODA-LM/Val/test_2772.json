The first is a large concrete mixer truck positioned directly in front of the ego car, with its rear lights on, indicating that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. The size and position of the truck are significant as they may block the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead, necessitating a safe following distance to be maintained in anticipation of any abrupt stops or turns the truck may make. Additionally, there is a white SUV on the left side of the image, parallel to the ego car. The presence of the SUV in the adjacent lane means the ego car must be vigilant for any potential lane changes or movements from the SUV.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a yellow directional sign above the road to the right of the mixer truck, which indicates a merging road or a split ahead. This sign implies that the ego car should be wary of other vehicles that may be merging from the right.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a red light above the rear of the concrete mixer truck. This red light means that the ego car is required to come to a complete stop and wait for the light to change to green before continuing.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The adjacent SUV should be monitored for any lane changes that could affect the lane the ego car is traveling in. Additionally, the ego vehicle should be prepared for other vehicles that may merge from the right, as indicated by the yellow directional sign."
