Both vehicles are stationary and should not obstruct the path of the self-driving vehicle. However, caution is needed for doors opening or pedestrians emerging from behind these vehicles. The bus could also suddenly move and join the traffic flow, so monitoring for any signs of activity is necessary.\n  - In the lane ahead, there are several motor vehicles, including a white vehicle and another bus. These vehicles indicate the flow of traffic ahead; their actions, such as sudden braking or turning, will affect the following distance and speed adjustments of our vehicle.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A group of pedestrians wearing orange uniforms are engaged in roadside activities or maintenance work on the right side of the road. They are close to the edge of the driving lane and may enter the roadway, requiring cautious driving and readiness to stop. They appear to be workers, suggesting possible road construction and increased pedestrian activity.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A green traffic light is visible in the distance. A green light indicates that the vehicle may proceed, but vigilance is required for potential changes in the signal and the behavior of other road users. It signifies the right of way, but readiness to respond to changes in the light or crossing traffic when approaching an intersection is necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - A series of orange traffic cones are arranged from the front of the parked yellow bus, extending along the right edge of this lane to the position of the workers. These cones indicate that a section of the road may be closed or under construction, guiding vehicles to stay to the left of the lane to avoid them. They delineate the work area or certain obstacles, directing traffic to detour around the area.\n\nNo other categories contain relevant road users or objects in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, especially when approaching the work zone on the right. Maintain a prudent speed and be ready to slow down or stop for workers on the roadside at any moment. Pay attention to whether the parked yellow bus is moving and keep to the center or left side of your lane to safely pass the traffic cones without entering the adjacent lane. As you approach intersections, be vigilant for any changes in the traffic lights. It's important to be prepared for pedestrians who may enter the road from the right and for any changes in the traffic light signals. The presence of workers requires a reduction in speed and increased alertness to safely navigate the area, and the potential hazards of parked vehicles, roadside workers, and slippery road conditions necessitate maintaining a lower speed.",
