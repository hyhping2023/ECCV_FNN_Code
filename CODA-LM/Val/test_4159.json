This truck's size and position could limit visibility and restrict maneuverability for the ego car, requiring caution in case of sudden movements or lane merges. In addition, there are several stationary trucks and vehicles parallel parked or stopped on the right side of the road, which could start moving, thereby necessitating vigilant monitoring to anticipate traffic changes and avoid collisions. A light-colored van and a dark-colored truck are partially visible in the closest right lane, and their proximity may affect the ego car's lane choices and overtaking decisions due to their potential movement or obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, a blue directional sign with white arrows and text indicates a detour or specific lane usage to the right, advising the ego car to prepare for the indicated route or lane changes. There are also visible blue barriers on the right side of the road, indicating a construction or roadwork area. These barriers suggest a change in the road layout or a reduction in lanes ahead, requiring careful navigation and possibly slowing down."

Due to its size and the nature of its cargo, the truck may move slower and make wider turns than smaller vehicles. It might also stop frequently to deliver its load. As a result, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops ahead.",

Keep attention on the stationary vehicles to the right to anticipate if any might merge into traffic. Be prepared for a change in road directions, as indicated by the directional sign, and adjust position if necessary for a potential leftward turn or merger. Considering the heavy vehicle presence and potential roadwork indicated by the barriers and signs, the ego car should maintain a lower speed and heightened vigilance. Following distance should be increased to allow for safe stopping, and the car should stay alert for any signals from the construction vehicles or workers that may require sudden stops or lane changes. Monitoring for any changes in the lane structure due to the barriers and following any detour signs promptly will help ensure safety and smooth navigation through the area."
