    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a sufficient following distance from the mixer truck to prevent issues caused by falling debris and ensure a clear view of the road ahead. If the traffic light ahead turns yellow or red, be prepared to brake and pay attention to cars in adjacent lanes and multiple vehicles in side lanes, as they may merge into your lane. Regularly monitor the movements of pedestrians to detect their intent to cross the street and stay alert to the situation in the opposite lane to prevent any sudden actions or incidents that might cross into your lane. Stay vigilant for changes in traffic conditions or road signs that may occur as the vehicle progresses. If safe, consider changing lanes to avoid potential hazards from the truck and to achieve a better view of the road ahead, ensuring the lane change is safe and appropriately signaling before merging.",

Due to its size and the nature of the material it carries, such a vehicle may move slower than typical traffic and may require additional space for maneuvering.
