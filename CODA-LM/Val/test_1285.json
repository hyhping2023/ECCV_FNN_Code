The crane boom extends upwards and to the right, partially occupying the adjacent lane. This crane is part of a construction zone and indicates potential construction activity ahead that might affect traffic flow and the passable width of the adjacent lane.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, pedestrians are seen on the sidewalk to the right, walking away from the direction of the ego vehicle. Their proximity to construction work and a large vehicle suggests the need for the driver to remain vigilant to ensure safety for all and be prepared for possible pedestrian crossings. Additionally, cyclists are present on the bike lane to the right, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. They pose a potential hazard if they were to merge into traffic or if the ego vehicle needs to change lanes, necessitating maintaining a safe distance and being prepared for possible cyclist maneuvers.\n\nNo traffic signs are present in the image. However, the absence of traffic lights is noted, implying that the ego car must rely on road signs and the behavior of other road users to make decisions, as no traffic lights are visible.\n\nA series of orange traffic cones are placed on the edge of the ego vehicle's lane, creating a channel that guides the traffic through the construction zone. These cones narrow the drivable area and indicate that the ego car must remain in its lane and proceed with caution.\n\nPhysical road work barriers are visible on the right, cordoning off an area of construction. These barriers suggest the presence of workers or that part of the road is unavailable for driving, requiring the driver to reduce speed and possibly merge left.\n\nOther objects include red and white striped warning tape and construction-related barriers and ribbons surrounding the construction area to the right of the ego vehicle's lane. These indicate the boundaries of the work area and the active construction work, respectively. They are placed to keep vehicles out of certain areas for safety reasons, indicating that the ego car must proceed with increased awareness and adherence to the guided path."
