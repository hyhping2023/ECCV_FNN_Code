        "description and explanation": "The traffic image under consideration reveals the presence of traffic cones and barriers, while there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects identified. The traffic cones described are located on the right side of the lane, showcasing alternating red and white colors. These cones are indicative of either demarcation for road works or a temporary adjustment in the traffic pattern. The explanation provided suggests that these cones play a vital role in alerting drivers to potential hazards or changes in their usual driving path, necessitating a possible reduction in speed or an increase in attentiveness. \n\nAdditionally, temporary barriers or delineator posts with reflective strips are positioned on the right side of the driving lane. They are implemented to either separate traffic lanes or to guide traffic away from potential hazards or areas under construction. The explanation for their presence emphasizes the need for drivers to remain within the lane boundaries and steer clear of the areas being protected by these barriers."

The driver should also anticipate potential movements from other vehicles around the demarcated area and prepare to adapt accordingly. Maintain a reduced speed and stay in the left side of the current driving lane to avoid the cones and barriers on the right. Be attentive to possible road workers or additional signage indicating further changes in the road layout ahead. Since it is night and visibility is reduced, increased caution is advised. Use the vehicle's headlights to improve visibility and alertness to the surrounding area."
