        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a number of notable elements present that impact navigation and require the attention of the ego vehicle. Firstly, a white vehicle is identified as being parked on the right side of the road ahead, which is visible through the support pillars of an overpass. Although this parked vehicle is not an immediate obstacle in the path of the ego vehicle, it necessitates vigilance for any sudden movements, such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging around it.\n\nIn terms of signage, there is a sign affixed to a column on the right bearing Chinese characters, which could potentially denote parking instructions or provide local information. The precise meaning of the sign might not be instantly clear, but the very existence of such signage usually signals areas where caution is advised, or specific local traffic regulations might be in effect. Taking note of these could be crucial for the ego vehicle to adapt its behavior accordingly.\n\nAnother critical observation is the presence of traffic cones in the center of the road, linked by red-and-white striped tape, effectively forming a barrier. This setup strongly suggests a road closure or a similar type of restriction, providing a clear directive to drivers not to proceed further along this path.\n\nAmongst other objects, a dustbin is spotted to the right, near the column where the sign is placed. Although it's not obstructing the road, its position next to the parked vehicle and close to the signage underlines a potential for pedestrian activity. The vicinity of such objects to the roadway serves as a reminder for the ego vehicle to be prepared for unexpected elements, including pedestrians possibly crossing or engaging in activities near the roadside.\n\nAltogether, these observations—ranging from parked vehicles and traffic cones to local signage, and roadside objects—pose various demands on the awareness and responsiveness of the ego vehicle in navigating through the area safely and efficiently."

The purpose of this object is to create a protective or architectural perimeter and to control or direct road traffic.
