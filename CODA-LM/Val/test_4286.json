        "description and explanation": "In the image, various road users and traffic elements are present. Firstly, several vehicles are observed. To the left, vehicles are traveling in the same direction as our car, which means they might change lanes, requiring the vehicle to monitor for potential merges. There is another vehicle ahead in the center of the image, though its details are obscured; it is likely traveling in the same direction, so distance and speed need to be monitored to prevent a collision. Additionally, vehicles are present in the opposite lane. While they do not pose a direct threat, unexpected maneuvers should still be anticipated.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, pedestrians are walking on the right-side sidewalk, moving forward parallel to the road. Although they are not on the road, drivers must remain alert to ensure they do not step into the traffic lane. A cyclist is also riding in the bike lane on the right, traveling in the same direction as our car, requiring the vehicle to maintain a safe distance owing to potential sudden changes in direction or turns.\n\nFurthermore, a green traffic light ahead is illuminated, granting the right of way to this vehicle as well as others traveling in the same direction. There are no visible traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Our vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, paying attention to its brake lights as a signal to stop. Continuous monitoring of adjacent lanes is needed to watch for vehicles that might enter our lane. Special care should be taken near motorcycles to ensure they do not enter our blind spot. The green traffic light indicates it is safe to proceed, but drivers should remain vigilant when approaching an intersection to guard against any sudden changes. Continue to observe pedestrians to ensure they do not step onto the street. Avoid areas marked off by traffic cones, and adjust speed appropriately according to road surface conditions. Our vehicle should also be aware of bicycles on the right, giving them enough space. Unless road conditions change and it is safe to do so, it is advised not to change lanes. When approaching an intersection, maintain a moderate speed, be observant of obscured vehicles ahead, and provide appropriate space for vehicles turning left when necessary. If pedestrians decide to cross or there's a need to safely pass bicycles, our vehicle should be prepared to adjust its driving path, while also considering obstacles that may arise from constructions indicated by traffic cones. Assuming our vehicle intends to go straight, it should monitor oncoming traffic to prevent accidents and pass through the intersection with caution due to surrounding activities.",
