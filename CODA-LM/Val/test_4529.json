        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there is a notable presence of a large trailer to the right of my vehicle, distinguishable by the visibility of its taillights which suggest its close proximity. The situation requires careful attention because the large vehicle can influence the driving behavior, particularly if there's a need to perform a lane change or if it extends into the adjacent lane. No other categories of road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are observed in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, adjust your speed according to traffic flow, and consider the increased stopping distance that may be caused by wet roads. If visibility is reduced due to wet conditions or the headlights of other vehicles, use low beam headlights. Stay alert to any sudden changes in the traffic ahead, and be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary. Considering the size of trucks and the reduced visibility that may result from blocked lights or possible spray, keep a safe distance from trucks. In addition, due to slippery roads, autonomous vehicles should reduce speed and increase following distance to ensure a safe stopping distance. Autonomous vehicles should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front while traveling at a safe speed. Pay attention to tail lights for clues about traffic conditions. Continuously scan the environment for any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic patterns. Although there is no immediate danger, the presence of large trucks reminds us to be vigilant for possible falling debris or obstacles that may not be immediately visible.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large commercial vehicle, specifically a truck, that appears to be carrying construction equipment or machinery. Given its size, the truck likely occupies more space on the road than a standard passenger vehicle, which could affect the flow of traffic. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance from the truck, as it may have larger blind spots and could make sudden stops or turns. It may also take longer for the truck to accelerate or decelerate, so anticipation and awareness of its actions are necessary for safe driving.",
