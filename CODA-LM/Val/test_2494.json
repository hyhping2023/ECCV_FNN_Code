        "description and explanation": "In the image, there are two vehicles present on the road. The first one is a large cement mixer truck positioned ahead of us in the left lane, moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The truck is easily recognizable by its rotating drum. Due to the size of the truck and the nature of its cargo, there is a possibility of debris on the road or obstacles emerging, especially if it's actively dispensing material. Therefore, our driving behavior must adapt by increasing our following distance and remaining vigilant for any potential unexpected maneuvers the truck may make.\n\nThe second vehicle is a flatbed truck located in the right lane, also traveling in the same direction. It's carrying what appears to be machinery or industrial equipment. The risk with this vehicle is that its cargo may not be fully secured, posing a hazard if any items were to fall off. As a precaution, we should sustain a cautious approach when in proximity to this truck, and consider widening the lateral distance between our vehicle and the flatbed truck."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck, is visible with a rotating drum used for mixing cement. Given its large size and the possibility of it making sudden movements or stops for construction purposes, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance to avoid collisions and be prepared for potential obstructions or debris that might fall from the truck. Additionally, this type of vehicle may make wide turns; thus, cautious driving is advised when in close proximity.",

Prepare to adjust the ego car's position within the lane to maximize the distance from the flatbed truck's cargo to the right. Monitor the behavior of both trucks and be ready to react safely to any road debris or unexpected movements. Maintain a safe speed that allows for reaction to unforeseen events while observing all applicable traffic norms and regulations."
