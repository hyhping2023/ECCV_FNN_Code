A large red truck is located directly ahead of the ego car in the right lane, carrying green and red shipping containers. The truck's size and position make it important for the ego car to keep an increased following distance and proceed with extra caution due to limited maneuverability and visibility.\n\nAlso present is a black SUV in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. The ego car should take note of the SUV when considering a lane change and maintain an adequate distance for safety reasons.\n\nAdditionally, there is an overhead traffic sign on the right side of the road seen from a distance. Although its specific instructions or warnings are not discernible in the image, the ego car should prepare to observe any potential signs as it gets closer.\n\nFinally, there are orange traffic cones beginning at the rear of the red truck and extending further ahead in the ego car's right lane. These traffic cones suggest that there is either a lane closure or road works ahead, which means that vehicles in the right lane will need to merge into the left lane to continue safely.\n\nVulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects are not present in the image according to the provided data."
