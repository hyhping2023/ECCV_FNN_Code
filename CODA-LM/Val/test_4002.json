These cones indicate that the lane ahead narrows or closes, guiding traffic to bypass the affected lanes, possibly due to road construction or the need for drivers to merge left due to road obstructions.\n\nContinuous barriers have been set up on both sides of the highway, separating the highway from the surrounding environment and indicating that pedestrian access is not permitted. These barriers also reduce the risk of vehicles leaving the road.\n\nLastly, on the right side, there are temporary obstacles equipped with reflective elements, arranged in parallel with the traffic cones.

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a steady speed and pay attention to the curve ahead. If you are currently in the right lane, please merge into the left lane due to the indicated lane closure, and follow the road markings to safely navigate through the curve. Moreover, since the arrow sign suggests that turning may be sharp, please decelerate as needed to ensure the vehicle remains under control while turning. The vehicle should keep to its lane, slow down, and be prepared to merge left if necessary, while staying alert for the possible sudden appearance of other road users, and comply with further instructions from road signs or traffic personnel. Given the night-time conditions and the right curve sign, the vehicle should also maintain a safe driving speed.",

It commonly has a white and orange striped pattern for high visibility. In this driving scenario, the presence of a traffic cone indicates that there may be roadwork, obstacles, or a change in traffic patterns ahead. The ego car must prepare to slow down, be vigilant, and possibly change lanes if necessary to maintain safety and abide by road regulations.",
