The vehicle's presence suggests that there may be ongoing construction or road work ahead. Consequently, the ego car should reduce its speed and proceed with caution, being prepared for potential obstacles or instructions from construction crew members.

The ego car should also be ready to navigate around any obstacles or changes in road surface quality. Keeping a safe distance from the construction vehicle and any workers on site is also advised."
