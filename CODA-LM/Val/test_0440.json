The driver of the ego car should keep a safe distance from this vehicle and be ready to adapt to any of its potential movements. There are also orange and white traffic cones on the left-hand side of the ego car, signaling a restricted area possibly due to construction or road work. It is important for the ego car to remain to the right to steer clear of this area. Along the same side of the road, temporary grey construction barriers are in place, stretching along the road's length. This indicates an active construction area, asking for the ego car's driver to maintain high alertness for any unforeseen obstructions or alterations in traffic flow that might occur. Furthermore, there are some irregularities observed on the left side of the road. Although they're not directly in the path of the ego car, they require monitoring should they begin to infringe upon the driving lane or if workers or equipment are present that could affect the path of the vehicle."
