This sedan's position dictates the immediate following distance and speed, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - Several pedestrians are on the sidewalk to the right, including an individual wearing a green top who appears to be about to cross the side street. These pedestrians near the roadway may enter the street, posing a risk that requires the ego vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A green traffic light is visible ahead over the intersection, indicating that vehicles on the road have the right of way to proceed. Although the green light allows the ego car to continue moving forward, it must be ready to stop if the lights change.\n\nNo other objects, barriers, traffic cones, or traffic signs are noted in this image."
