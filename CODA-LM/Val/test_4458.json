However, a series of traffic cones is arranged diagonally across the lane. These cones extend from the center of the road toward the right side, indicating a lane closure or diversion. The arrangement of these cones suggests that there might be road construction or an obstacle ahead, necessitating vehicles to merge left or change lanes in order to pass the closed-off section. No other objects are noted in the scene."

Maintain lane discipline according to road markings, practice defensive driving, and be mindful that traffic cones may signify the presence of construction workers or mechanical equipment near the driving lanes.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is typically used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when road lanes need to be temporarily closed. Its bright patterns are highly visible to drivers, and it often indicates areas that are off-limits to vehicular traffic. As such, the ego car should ensure not to drive over or too close to this marker to avoid potential hazards and respect the temporary traffic layout.",

Its bright color and reflective material serve to catch the driver's attention and signal to them to steer clear of a potentially hazardous or prohibited area. In this future driving scenario, the presence of this traffic cone on the road would require the driver of the ego car to navigate around it, ensuring they do not cross into the area the cone is protecting or designating.",
