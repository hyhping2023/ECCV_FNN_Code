The red light indicates that traffic in the lanes it governs needs to stop. The ego car should confirm which lanes are affected by the light and whether it needs to stop as well.\n\nThere is also a series of traffic cones on the right side of the ego car's lane, narrowing the drivable road space. These cones could indicate a road hazard or construction area ahead, necessitating the ego car to navigate this reduced space carefully while maintaining a safe distance from the cones to prevent damage to the vehicle or the road setup.\n\nFurthermore, there are white barriers along the right side of the road, establishing the boundary of the drivable area. These barriers separate the road from the pedestrian area or other parts of the infrastructure, clearly delineating where the ego car can drive."

It is important to monitor for any traffic signs that might be difficult to see at night or signals from the overhead traffic light relevant to its lane. Adjusting speed due to the possibility of a wet road surface is also advised to ensure safety."
