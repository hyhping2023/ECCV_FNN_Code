Their headlights and tail lights are visible, suggesting that some vehicles are moving away from the autonomous car's perspective, while others may be moving across or towards the intersection. The positioning and movement of these vehicles require the autonomous car to adjust its speed and lane choice accordingly, ensuring a safe following distance and readiness for potential actions from the other vehicles, such as lane changes or deceleration.\n\nThe traffic light within view of the autonomous car is showing a red signal. This necessitates that the autonomous car must stop fully at the signal and wait for a green light before continuing onwards. While waiting, the autonomous car should remain alert and monitor the intersection for any road users who might be influenced by the change in the traffic light.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes at least one traffic cone positioned on the right side near the intersection area. The presence of the traffic cone suggests there could be road work or lane closures up ahead. Consequently, the autonomous car must stay vigilant for possible obstructions or alterations to the available roadway space that might affect its path or lane availability."
