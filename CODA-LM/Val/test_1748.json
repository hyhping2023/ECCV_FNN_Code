        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several key elements affecting the driving behavior of the ego car:\n\n1. **Vehicles**:\n   - A white sedan is stopped in the middle of the road ahead, occupying the driving lane. This vehicle is obstructing the path of the ego car, requiring a change in the driving path, and represents an immediate obstacle that could affect the flow of traffic and may indicate an emergency situation or a mechanical breakdown requiring attention.\n   - A white van is parked on the side of the road to the right, parallel to the curb. While this vehicle is not blocking the lane, its presence should be noted in case of doors opening or pedestrians moving around it. Although not directly obstructing traffic, it is close to the road and should be considered when vehicles merge from the blocked lane.\n   - Multiple cars are parked on both sides of the street. These parked vehicles narrow the available road width and can potentially hide crossing pedestrians or open doors into traffic. The parked vehicles indicate that there may be activity on the side of the road, and the ego car should proceed with caution.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - An illuminated blue road sign is visible overhead on the right, indicating directions or road names. This sign provides context for navigation but does not immediately impact driving behavior. This may contain important traffic information and the content should be made clear to the ego vehicle when in closer range.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light ahead is green. The green traffic signal indicates the ego car can proceed but with caution due to the stopped vehicle in the driving lane. The ego car has the right of way to continue moving forward.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - Metal barriers are lining the sidewalk on the right, separating the pedestrian walkway from the road. These barriers ensure that pedestrians are not in the road and reduce the risk of unexpected pedestrian entry into the road space. These barriers indicate a separation between the pedestrian zone and the driving lanes, and that no pedestrians should be expected to cross here.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n   - There is an object on the road behind the white car, which looks like a bag or debris. The object could pose a risk to vehicles; it should be avoided by the ego car to prevent potential damage or accidents.\n\nOverall, the scene requires the ego car to navigate around a stopped vehicle, be cautious of potential pedestrian activity near parked cars, proceed with the green light, and avoid the object on the road."

The presence of this cone in the driving scenario suggests that the ego car may need to adjust its path to avoid the area marked by the cone, which could indicate road work, a roadside incident, or another hazard that requires drivers to steer clear of this part of the roadway.",

Ensure the lane change is executed with caution, checking for blind spots and signaling to inform other road users of the maneuver. Continue to monitor the parked vehicles for any unexpected movement or pedestrians. Adhere to road signs and signals while proceeding through the intersection. The ego car should maintain lane discipline while passing the stopped sedan with hazard lights and be prepared for other vehicles to merge into their lane from the right. The driver should keep an eye on any movement around the parked white van and the vehicles behind the barrier while checking the overhead electronic sign for any pertinent traffic information."
