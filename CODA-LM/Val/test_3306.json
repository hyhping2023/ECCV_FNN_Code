        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two notable categories of road users and elements that affect driving behavior, namely barriers and other objects.\n\nStarting with barriers, one can identify barricades and temporary fencing obstructing a portion of the road, specifically on the left side. This setup suggests that the area is either closed or restricted. The presence of these physical barriers necessitates that autonomous vehicles must navigate around them with caution or, in cases where the route is completely obstructed, opt to turn around.\n\nMoving on to other objects, there's a significant concern with oncoming traffic or intense lighting from the scene that shines directly ahead. This situation can lead to glare, severely reducing visibility for the vehicle's driver. Such glare is problematic as it hampers the driver's ability to see the road ahead clearly, along with any potential hazards. Consequently, this increases the risk of accidents due to impaired visibility.\n\nIn this scenario, while other road users such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and traffic cones are not present within the image, the mentioned barriers and issues with visibility stand out as critical factors to consider for navigating the autonomous vehicle safely."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should significantly reduce their speed and pass through construction zones safely, ensuring an adequate safety distance from motorcycles. They should also be aware of guardrails, traffic cones, and potential visibility reduction due to glare. Be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully at all times, giving way to motorcycles and parked bicycles. If the roadway is blocked or an accident occurs, drivers should look for alternative routes, or if it is safe to do so, carefully continue around the obstacle. Otherwise, they should wait for the site to be cleared or for instructions from traffic management personnel.",
