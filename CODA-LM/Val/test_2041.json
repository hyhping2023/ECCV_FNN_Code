On the left side, a blue car is parked, partially obstructing the lane, which narrows the available road space and complicates maneuvering around the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, two construction workers are standing on the left edge of the road, wearing reflective vests and yellow helmets, with one holding tools. Their presence signifies ongoing road work, necessitating extra caution from the ego car, including reducing speed and maintaining a safe distance to ensure their safety.\n\nAn elevated work platform is situated on the left side of the road above the workers, indicating overhead work. This suggests possible falling debris or equipment extending into the roadway, mandating a cautious approach from the ego car."
