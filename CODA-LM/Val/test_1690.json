Its rear lights are on, enhancing its visibility despite low visibility conditions. This truck may impact the drivable space due to its close proximity and potential unpredictability.\n   - Several vehicles with headlights on are ahead of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. These vehicles suggest a flow of traffic with varying speeds, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust accordingly.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - No pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are visible in the current field of view, negating the need for any immediate action related to these users.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - A series of orange traffic cones is positioned along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, starting near the truck and extending forward, marking the separation between the driving lane and a work zone or hazard area. These cones indicate a need to maintain a safe distance from the right side and may signal an upcoming lane narrowing or a shift in the traffic pattern.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - A concrete barrier is positioned on the right side, extending along the edge of the lane behind the line of traffic cones. The barrier further defines the driving space boundary, reinforcing the need for the ego vehicle to stay in the current lane and avoid any rightward lane changes."

The use of headlights is recommended to improve visibility for the ego vehicle and to be visible to other road users. Monitoring the truck's position relative to the ego car is also important to anticipate any potential hazards."
