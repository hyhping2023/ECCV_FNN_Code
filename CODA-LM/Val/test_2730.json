The truck's position may reduce the drivable width of the lane for the ego car, necessitating caution and possibly requiring the ego car to maneuver to the right when passing.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there is a white car traveling in the same direction. Since it is in the same lane, the white car's speed and direction will influence the ego car's driving decisions, such as speed control and maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a cyclist moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist means the ego car must exercise increased vigilance and be ready to slow down or change lanes to ensure a safe passing distance.\n\nRegarding traffic signs and traffic lights, there are no clear traffic signs or traffic lights visible in the image. In the absence of these signals, the ego car should adhere to the standard road rules applicable to the type of road it is on.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or barriers in the image, indicating that there are no immediate road works or obstructions that would affect the ego car's path or require a detour or lane change.\n\nLastly, there are piles of debris and trash scattered on both sides of the road, with a notable amount on the right side that might extend onto the road. The ego car must be cautious of these potential obstacles and be prepared to steer away if necessary to avoid the debris."
