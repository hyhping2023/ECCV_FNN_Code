The ego vehicle should maintain its current lane and speed while being mindful of these vehicles to prevent any collisions. Additionally, there are individual vehicles traveling on the road ahead, identifiable by their headlights and tail lights, which are in motion. The ego car needs to keep an eye on the speed and direction of these moving vehicles to ensure a safe following distance and to be ready for any necessary lane changes or speed adjustments. Furthermore, there are moving vehicles on the opposite lane with their headlights on, driving away from the ego car, which indicates the presence of oncoming traffic in that lane.\n\nThe traffic lights in the distance are green, indicating that the intersection ahead is open for the ego vehicle to proceed. The ego vehicle should continue towards the intersection with the intention to pass through, unless the light changes.\n\nOther objects in the scene include street lights on the side that provide illumination and trees lining the edge of the road. These do not directly affect driving behavior, but it is important for the environment to be perceived accurately to avoid mistaking shadows or reflections for actual objects or road users. There is also a rubbish bin on the sidewalk near the parked vehicles. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle as long as it stays on the sidewalk, it should be kept under observation in case it moves unexpectedly, such as being blown onto the road. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

Constant vigilance is required to monitor both the parked vehicles and any potential hazards that may enter the roadway unexpectedly. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to give way to any oncoming traffic that might cross into the ego car's lane from the opposite direction."
