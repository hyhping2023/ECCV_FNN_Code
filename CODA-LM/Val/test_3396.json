However, there is an obscured traffic sign on the right side of the road: white with a visible border, but due to the main symbol or text being indecipherable, its precise instructions cannot be determined. Because of its obscurity, the ego car must drive cautiously and stay alert for any other signage that might be more visible, for proper guidance.\n\nFurthermore, there is a red and white striped railing barrier also on the right side of the road, indicating there is a boundary or restricted area ahead. This could potentially be due to roadside work or to protect against a drop-off. As a result, the autonomous vehicle must maintain a position to the left to avoid this barrier.\n\nAdditionally, a sizable pile of dirt or debris is situated on the right side of the road just prior to the barrier. Its presence requires careful driving as it narrows the drivable portion of the road and could inflict damage if struck. To ensure safety, the ego car should decelerate and maintain a considerable distance from this hazard. There are no traffic lights or traffic cones in this image."

In response, the driver of the ego car will need to stop or maneuver carefully around the obstruction, ensuring that it is safe to do so without colliding with the boulder or any oncoming traffic. As part of future driving behavior, the driver should also remain vigilant for any potential additional hazards that may be present due to the unstable terrain or further falling debris.",
