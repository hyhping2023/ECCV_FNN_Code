However, there are traffic signs visible above the parked vehicles indicating both a pedestrian crossing or school zone and imposing a no honking restriction. These signs suggest the presence of nearby vulnerable road users, emphasizing the need for drivers to remain vigilant and reduce noise pollution. Additionally, traffic cones are positioned along the road's edge to denote areas off-limits to vehicles. They serve as a warning to self-driving cars to slow down and heighten awareness due to the potential hazards or boundary zones they demarcate. Lastly, there are reflections coming off delivery vehicles that could impair visibility or distract drivers, highlighting the potential challenge of dealing with glare which can obscure clear sight of other road users or traffic signals. Traffic lights and barriers are not present in this image, nor are there any other concerning objects noted aside from the aforementioned items."

    "driving_suggestion": "Considering the identified conditions and road users, autonomous vehicles should come to a complete stop at red lights, remain quiet as indicated by signs, and be ready to yield to pedestrians who may be crossing or about to cross the road, even if there are no pedestrians currently in sight. While waiting, the autonomous vehicle driver should stay alert, looking out for signs of pedestrians or other road users that may appear due to warning signs. Once the light turns green, the autonomous vehicle should proceed with caution, paying attention to any reduction in lane width caused by parked delivery vans, and be ready to change lanes if the path is not clear, in order to safely navigate around obstacles, ensuring there is enough space to pass safely without entering the opposite lane. Autonomous vehicles should also avoid using the horn and comply with local traffic rules.",
