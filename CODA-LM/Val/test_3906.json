Some of these vehicles are parked in such a manner that they are half on the sidewalk and half on the roadway on the right side, while a larger vehicle, possibly a bus or truck, is parked on the left side of the road ahead. The presence of these vehicles significantly reduces the available width of the road for the ego car to navigate through. Additionally, these parked vehicles could potentially obscure the view of any pedestrians attempting to step onto the road or other hazards that may be present, making it imperative for the ego car to proceed with caution.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are visible in the immediate vicinity, indicating no immediate action is required from the ego car regarding vulnerable road users. However, caution is advised as these individuals can sometimes be difficult to spot, especially during nighttime conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the image showcases unspecified debris or piles of material located on the side of the road, with larger piles particularly noticeable on the right side. These objects could potentially encroach onto the driving path, posing a hazard that necessitates the ego car to adopt slower speeds and exercise increased attention to safely navigate past them.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image, indicating that these elements do not currently contribute to the driving conditions or behavior of the ego car in this scenario."

Use the vehicle's headlights and possibly high beams if traffic conditions allow, to improve visibility."
