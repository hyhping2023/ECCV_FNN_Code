        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals several key details about the current driving environment:\n\n1. Vehicles:\n   - Ahead in the same lane, there are several cars with their brake lights on, signaling a potential stop or slowdown in traffic. This necessitates that the lead car adjusts by slowing down and increasing the following distance to prevent collisions.\n   - In the adjacent left lane, a parallel car also has its brake lights illuminated, indicating similar traffic conditions in that lane. This requires careful monitoring of adjacent lanes, which could influence lane-changing decisions.\n\n2. Traffic Lights:\n   - Multiple red lights are visible at the intersection for all lanes, requiring the autonomous car to stop and wait for a green signal.\n   - A pedestrian traffic light on the right also shows a red light, indicating that pedestrians are not allowed to cross. This minimizes the risk of pedestrians entering the roadway, allowing the vehicle to focus on the vehicular traffic ahead.\n\n3. Other Objects:\n   - On the right-hand side of the road, a blue object, possibly debris or fallen cargo, is present. This poses a potential hazard that vehicles must avoid to prevent damage or losing control.\n\nThis comprehensive assessment informs the autonomous car about the current traffic conditions and potential hazards, guiding its driving behavior accordingly."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should travel at a cautious speed, optimize the distance from the car ahead, and be prepared to deal with the potential sudden stops due to traffic conditions. Additionally, if considering changing lanes, pay attention to the vehicles in the left lane. The vehicle must also be prepared to safely navigate around the blue object on the road, while maintaining the integrity of the lane and ensuring that it does not disrupt surrounding traffic. Proceed cautiously under the permission of the green traffic light. Given the current condition of road users, the vehicle should remain prudent when going straight, respect the traffic conditions and red light signals, and be ready to stop in response to changes in traffic ahead. Be vigilant for potential changes in traffic light signals as the vehicle advances. For red traffic lights and the queue of stopped cars ahead, the vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to stop. It must remain stationary before the traffic light turns green. Considering there are no visible vulnerable road users and no direct obstacles present, the focus should be on the vehicles ahead and the traffic lights. Once the details of the traffic sign on the right are clear, compliance with the final instructions is also mandatory.",
