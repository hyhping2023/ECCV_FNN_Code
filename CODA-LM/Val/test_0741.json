This position necessitates that the ego vehicle might have to either slow down or switch lanes to bypass the mixer safely.\n- Further ahead, beneath a bridge, a bus in a lane merging with that of the ego vehicle is observed. This requires the ego vehicle to possibly alter its speed or change lanes in order to keep a safe distance from the bus.\n- A smaller vehicle can be seen behind the bus at a greater distance. Although it doesn't have an immediate effect on the ego vehicle's driving actions, it's important to keep an eye on it since it may influence traffic conditions and subsequent driving decisions.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- There is a motorcyclist close to the intersection coming from the left in a converging lane. The ego vehicle must keep a safe distance behind the motorcycle and stay alert to any potential quick maneuvers by the motorcyclist, as they are more susceptible to harm.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A traffic signal is discernible in front, exhibiting a red light for the lane of both the ego vehicle and the motorcyclist. The ego vehicle is required to come to a full stop at the intersection, making sure it doesn't encroach into the crosswalk, and to be cautious of the motorcyclist who could stop suddenly. \n\nNo observed road users or items fall into the categories of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects within the traffic image."

Construction vehicles such as this one typically move slowly and may make unexpected movements as they operate within or move to and from a construction site. The ego car should maintain a heightened level of awareness when in the vicinity of such vehicles, ensuring there is ample space to allow for any unpredictable maneuvers the construction vehicle might make.
