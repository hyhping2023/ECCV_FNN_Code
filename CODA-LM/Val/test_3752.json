                "description": "A large truck, fitted with an evident cargo carry rack, has an orange excavator on top of its carriage, parked on a flatbed trailer just ahead to the right of the vehicle. The vehicle is more conspicuous under low-light conditions due to reflective markings.",
                "explanation": "Given the size of the truck, its obvious cargo capacity, the flashing hazard lights, and the illuminated brake lights, it is likely either moving slowly or preparing to stop, which could pose an obstacle, necessitating a reduction in speed or readiness to change lanes for the following vehicle. The presence of such a large and slow-moving vehicle impacts the possibility of overtaking or maintaining a safe following distance."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a significant presence of a large truck, which can be easily noticed due to its size and the distinct cargo carry rack mounted on it. Atop the rack sits an orange excavator, which is being carried on a flatbed trailer positioned just ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The truck's visibility is especially adequate in low-light conditions, which is enhanced by its reflective markings.\n\nThe truck has engaged its hazard lights and illuminated brake lights, suggesting that it may be in the process of slowing down or preparing to halt. Consequently, the following vehicles must be prepared to adjust their speed accordingly or be ready to change lanes if necessary. The size and potential slow movement of the truck are critical as they may hinder overtaking maneuvers and affect the ability to maintain a safe distance for vehicles traveling behind it."

    "driving_suggestion": "Given that the truck has activated its hazard warning lights and brake lights, our vehicle should slow down and prepare for possible maneuvers, such as stopping or changing lanes, especially being cautious of any indicated lane closures ahead. If the traffic light is green, passage is legal, but considering the actions that the truck and stationary vehicles might take, cautious driving is still recommended. Taking into account the possibility of wet or icy road conditions, a safe distance should be maintained from the truck, and one should be ready to respond to any sudden changes in the traffic ahead, including parked vehicles or lane mergers. Due to the potential slipperiness of the road, it is advisable to reduce speed and increase the following distance.",

The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be aware of potential movements of the construction vehicle, such as unexpected stops or turns. The vehicle's presence and operations may reduce the available lanes for traffic, requiring the ego car to possibly adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to navigate safely around the construction activity.",
