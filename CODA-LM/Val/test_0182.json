        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene in question features a variety of road users and objects that influence the driving behavior of our vehicle. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there are two parked cars that require attention. A white sedan is parked on the right side ahead, limiting the available lanes and necessitating careful maneuvering as our vehicle passes by. Additionally, a black car parked on the left side, perpendicular to our direction, currently poses no moving threat. However, our vehicle needs to stay alert in case it begins to move or its doors open.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, we observe a motorcyclist approaching our vehicle from the opposite lane. While they don't necessitate immediate action, their potential for sudden route changes or stops warrants monitoring.\n\nTraffic signs include a no parking sign on the left side of the road, emphasizing that parking is not allowed in this area. This sign is important as enforcement actions could impact road usage.\n\nIn terms of traffic lights, a red signal is visible at a crossroad in the distance. This requires our vehicle to be prepared to stop unless the light turns green as we approach.\n\nLastly, other objects of note include two scooters; one parked on the sidewalk to our right and another with a cargo box parked at the edge of the left traffic lane. While not directly on the road, the potential for these scooters to move into our path calls for cautious driving.\n\nThis scene lacks any traffic cones or barriers, indicating no ongoing construction or immediate physical obstructions in these categories."

    "driving_suggestion": "1. Your own vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the vehicles parked on the right, ensure that it stays within the available lane, and be ready to stop or take necessary evasive actions at all times, especially when overtaking parked vehicles.\n2. Due to the presence of no-parking signs, you should stay alert to avoid any unexpected movements of parked vehicles that could be caused by enforcement activities.\n3. Exercise caution when overtaking; the driver should be aware of oncoming traffic in the opposite lane, including motorcycles.\n4. While no immediate action is necessary for no-parking signs, their presence indicates that you should not consider parking in this area.\n5. Drive carefully, maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, and watch for any sudden movements from motorcycles and electric bikes.\n6. Prepare to stop, because the red traffic light at the upcoming intersection means that you must be ready to stop, unless the light turns green.\n7. Your vehicle should stay in its lane while also being vigilant for any signs of movement or door-opening from the parked green mini car.\n8. Maintain a safe distance following the white car and motorcycle, especially as motorcycles might stop abruptly, and be prepared at all times.\n9. When nearing an intersection, observe the traffic lights and take appropriate action according to the signals.\n10. Be mindful of the scooter on your right, and provide a sufficient gap when overtaking to ensure safety.\n11. Finally, pay attention to no-parking signs and avoid stopping or pulling over on that side of the road.",
