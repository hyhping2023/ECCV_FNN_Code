        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large concrete mixer truck driving ahead of the ego vehicle, taking up a significant portion of the roadway. The truck shows signs of material spillage, which is a potential hazard for debris dropping onto the road. The size and position of the mixer truck constitute an obstruction, thereby severely limiting the ego vehicle's capability to maneuver and overtake safely. \n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist on the right side of the road, also moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the cyclist means that the ego vehicle must maintain an adequate passing distance, which complicates overtaking the aforementioned concrete mixer truck.\n\nOther categories such as traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this scene according to the given data and hence do not require consideration for the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Additionally, when overtaking, ensure it is done with enough clearance to the cyclist to prevent any risk to their safety. Continue to monitor the behavior of both the cyclist and the truck for any sudden changes in speed or direction."
