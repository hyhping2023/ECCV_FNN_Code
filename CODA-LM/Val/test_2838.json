                "explanation": "Due to the truck occupying part of the adjacent lane, and its exact intentions or movements being unclear, it poses a potential hazard. Its size, coupled with the fact that it is carrying a tank, suggests that it might be loaded with a liquid, which could be dangerous in the event of an accident or sudden movement. The truck's current trajectory will affect driving strategy, as it occupies the space on the right, and if it changes lanes or encroaches on this lane, it will pose a potential danger."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a significant road user that catches attention - a large white truck equipped with a tank trailer. This vehicle is directly in front of us and appears to be in motion, possibly overtaking or merging into the lane ahead, based on its relative angle to the road. The presence of this truck is crucial to driving behavior due to a few reasons. Firstly, the truck occupies part of the adjacent lane, making its exact intentions or movements unclear, which introduces a potential hazard on the road. Its size, in combination with the fact that it's carrying a tank, suggests it might be transporting a liquid, heightening the risk in the event of an accident or sudden movement. Given the truck's current trajectory, it directly affects the driving strategy. It takes up space on the right, and any changes in its lane or encroachment on this lane pose a possible danger to surrounding vehicles, including ours. It is essential to monitor such a vehicle closely and adjust driving strategies accordingly to maintain safety on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the truck, and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid potential conflicts caused by the truck merging or changing lanes. Continuously monitor the truck's movement and signaling to anticipate any changes in their driving behavior. Follow standard road safety practices considering the visible road conditions. If traffic conditions change rapidly due to the truck's size obstructing the view of the road ahead, be ready to slow down at any time.",

            "description and explanation": "A large commercial vehicle, specifically a truck, is present. This vehicle typically transports goods and materials over land. For the ego vehicle, caution must be exercised due to the truck's size and potential blind spots. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance, as the truck's ability to stop quickly or maneuver may be limited compared to smaller vehicles. Overtaking such a large vehicle should be done with extra care, ensuring visibility and signal communication.",
