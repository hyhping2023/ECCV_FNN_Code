        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several road users and features are identified, impacting the driving behavior of the autonomous ego vehicle in various ways.\n\nFirstly, we have an orange construction vehicle with a crane arm extension, located directly ahead of the ego vehicle within the same lane, moving in the same direction. The size of the construction vehicle and the possibility of unexpected maneuvers such as abrupt slowing down or operational movements account for the need for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance and stay vigilant.\n\nAdditionally, there's a red sedan on the right, slightly ahead, in an adjacent lane, going the same way as the ego vehicle. The adjacency of this sedan is significant since it could potentially change lanes or alter its speed, influencing the ego carâ€™s decisions on lane switching or speed regulation.\n\nThere are also various cars parked on the side of the road to the right, with a red hatchback closest. These parked cars reduce the available width of the driving path, prompting the ego car to maintain an adequate lateral distance in case any of the parked vehicles suddenly enter the traffic flow.\n\nDistinct roadside signage is present, comprised of various commercial billboards and signs. Although they do not present immediate traffic directions or restrictions, the ego vehicle must remain perceptive of any upcoming traffic signs that may convey crucial information or instructions.\n\nThe traffic scene lacks a visual on a traffic light; thus, the ego vehicle needs to depend on road markings and remaining traffic signs to navigate.\n\nA median barrier covered with greenery is featured, splitting the lanes of opposing traffic flows. This barrier directs the ego vehicle to stay within its lane boundaries and prevents any attempt to cross over into the counterflow lanes.\n\nLastly, the scene includes trees and shrubs placed near the roadside, as well as light poles and trees aligned with the sidewalk. While these natural and infrastructural elements do not directly interfere with the path of the ego vehicle, they are usual roadside features that the vehicle should acknowledge but generally will not affect its driving behavior unless an atypical event occurs, such as a tree being uprooted."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle equipped with an articulated arm and a bucket attachment. This heavy-duty equipment is commonly used in construction activities for digging, earthmoving, or lifting materials. The presence of a construction vehicle on the road indicates that there may be construction work ahead or ongoing road maintenance. Due to its size and the nature of its work, this vehicle may obstruct traffic flow or require lane closures. Consequently, the ego car must be prepared to slow down, possibly stop, or change lanes if the construction activity encroaches upon the car's path, adhering to any temporary traffic signs or signals that may be in place to guide vehicles around the work zone.",

Be wary of the red sedan in the adjacent lane, and prepare for potential lane changes or adjustments in speed by the other vehicle. Continue monitoring for traffic signs and traffic lights, as well as any new road users that may enter the driving scene. Stay within the lane boundaries set by the road markings and the median barrier. Monitor the parked cars for any signs of movement, such as brake lights or turning wheels, to anticipate and react to potential hazards. As the traffic situation is dynamic, stay alert for any changes and adjust the ego car's speed accordingly."
