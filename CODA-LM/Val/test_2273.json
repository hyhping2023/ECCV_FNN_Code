        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present. However, there is a traffic light directly ahead of our vehicle displaying a green signal. This green traffic light indicates that the vehicle has the right to proceed, but the driver must still be aware of surrounding traffic and road users. Additionally, there are no traffic cones in the scene.\n\nA notable observation is a red obstacle on the right side of the vehicle. The presence of this obstacle suggests there might be roadblocks or detours. If the lane of the autonomous vehicle is affected, a lane change might be necessary to navigate around the obstacle safely.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the presence of bright lights flickering into the camera lens, coming from the vehicles and street lighting ahead. This lens flare may cause visibility issues with the camera sensor, potentially affecting the recognition of objects and traffic signs. This could pose a challenge for the autonomous driving system, requiring it to adapt to these conditions to ensure safe navigation."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead and pay attention to obstacles on the right in case the lane closes or there is a need to change lanes due to construction. Care should be taken while driving due to reduced visibility from lens flare and the increased stopping distance caused by the wet and slippery road surface. Be prepared for changes in oncoming traffic and be aware of any vehicles that may enter the lane from the parking area indicated by signs. Stay alert to any movement around roadside obstacles, which may signal road construction ahead or lane closures, and adjust your lane position as necessary, all while maintaining a safe speed for the road conditions. Due to slippery road conditions, slow down and be ready to merge left if the lane is blocked by a parked red vehicle. Watch for any maneuvers the oncoming white vehicle may execute at intersections. Since the traffic light is green, comply with basic right-of-way rules and adjust your driving according to the actions of other drivers.",
