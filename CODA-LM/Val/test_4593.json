        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several features of note.\n\nThere are two parked vehicles. The first is a yellow van on the right side of the road, facing away from the vehicle. Its presence has reduced the available driving space in the lane, creating a potential hazard if it starts moving. Secondly, a dark-colored sedan is positioned on the left side of the road, facing the direction of our vehicle. This sedan reduces the available road space and may conceal potential dangers such as individuals stepping out from behind it or doors suddenly being opened.\n\nA pedestrian is also present in the scene, standing beside the sedan on the right side of the road. It is unclear if they intend to cross the street or if they are simply distracted, but either way, they may enter the roadway and necessitate cautious driving behavior, including possibly slowing down or stopping.\n\nIn addition, there are barriers at the roadside. Specifically, there are temporary barriers with adjacent piles of garbage to the right, which limit lane usage and could obscure the view of further hazards such as pedestrians or animals, leading to sudden obstructions. On the left, a low concrete barrier runs along the roadside, effectively demarcating the limits of the road and private properties, ensuring the autonomous vehicle remains within the appropriate driving zone.\n\nLastly, on the right and near the temporary barriers, there are piles of trash. The scattered trash presents the possibility of becoming an unforeseen obstacle on the road if displaced by animals or wind.\n\nThe image lacks traffic signs, traffic lights, and traffic cones."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Be prepared to stop or slow down if pedestrians attempt to cross the road. Watch for any parked vans on the right that might start moving. Due to wet road conditions and potential debris, slow down to increase reaction time and ensure safety. Keep a safe distance from parked cars and debris on the right to avoid potential dangers. Monitor the yellow van for any sudden changes in trajectory and be ready to give way if necessary. If there is a safe distance to pass, proceed cautiously, checking for obstacles on the left. Given the presence of stationary vehicles, pedestrians approaching the road, traffic cones, and parked cars, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or navigate around unexpected obstacles. The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the yellow van and be alert for any signals of intent from pedestrians or the van. Additionally, the vehicle should monitor any potential hazards from garbage piled by the roadside entering the road. The wet road conditions mean that the vehicle should increase stopping distance and slow down.",

It consists of various discarded materials, which could potentially include trash, construction materials, or other waste items that are not appropriately disposed of. The presence of such debris could indicate an area undergoing construction or neglect. The debris could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by narrowing the usable width of the road, leading to the need for cautious driving to avoid any materials that might extend onto the roadway. Additionally, if the debris spills into the road, it may pose a hazard that requires drivers to swerve or stop to avoid a collision.",
