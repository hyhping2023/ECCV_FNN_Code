To the left, there is a blue bus positioned in the neighboring lane, slightly overlapping into the ego vehicle's lane. The bus's position suggests it might be merging into the ego vehicle's lane, presenting a potential hazard that needs to be monitored closely.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a black sedan in the same lane with its brake lights on. This indicates that the sedan is either slowing down or coming to a stop, which means the ego vehicle must also reduce speed to avoid a collision and prepare for possible traffic congestion ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there are red trucks visible ahead but in the opposite lanes, facing the opposite direction. While these trucks are not directly affecting the ego vehicle's immediate movements, they are indicative of the traffic flow and potential obstructions that could be encountered in the opposite lanes.\n\nLastly, there are trucks parked on the right side of the road, aligned in a row. They are not currently interfering with the flow of traffic, but their presence is noteworthy. It is important to remain vigilant to ensure that they do not make any sudden movements that could obstruct the ego vehicle's path.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving scenario."

Monitor oncoming traffic, including the red trucks on the opposite side, to stay aware of overall traffic conditions and any potential hazards that may arise."
