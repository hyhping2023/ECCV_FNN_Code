A dark-colored SUV is ahead, positioned directly in front of our vehicle, occupying the left lane and partially extending into our lane. The self-driving car needs to reduce speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance and be alert to any sudden stops or turns from this SUV. There is also a white van in the left lane up ahead, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle. Our vehicle must monitor the speed and direction of the van in case it changes lanes or slows down to turn. Additionally, a red car is parked on the side of the road to the right of our vehicle and could potentially pull onto the road. The self-driving car should be attentive to any signs of movement from this parked car. \n\nFurther, there is a gas station on the right dotted with a few other stationary vehicles, which currently do not directly affect the road. However, attention should be paid to whether they will enter the lane. Additionally, the right lane has many other vehicles participating in the traffic flow, and our vehicle should closely monitor them to avoid sudden lane changes, stops, or turns that could affect traffic flow.\n\nAs for other objects, the gas station on the right may attract vehicles to slow down or stop for refueling. The lead vehicle should be cautious of vehicles that may suddenly decelerate to enter the station, as this increases the risk of rear-end collisions."

Stay alert for vehicles that might slow down to enter a gas station. As traffic lights or signs are not visible, adhere to general traffic rules and be prepared for standard road conditions. Be ready to slow down or stop based on the brake lights of the vehicle ahead and closely monitor changes in the environment, such as newly appeared traffic signs, signal lights, or new road users entering the scene.",
