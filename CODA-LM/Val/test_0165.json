        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are various road users and elements that influence driving behavior. Firstly, there is a blue car directly in front of the ego car, displaying illuminated brake lights. This indicates that the car is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego car prepare to decelerate or stop as well, in order to maintain a safe following distance. \n\nAdjacent to this, on the left side of the road, there are directional traffic signs visible, which indicate a bend in the road ahead. It's important for the ego car to be aware of this upcoming change in the road's direction and to adjust its speed accordingly to navigate the bend safely.\n\nAdditionally, a red traffic light is observed ahead, which the car in front seems to be responding to by slowing down or stopping. This signals that the ego car must also prepare to stop at the traffic light, unless the light changes to green before reaching the intersection, allowing the traffic to proceed.\n\nMoreover, there are orange and white traffic cones placed on the left edge of the road. These cones indicate a demarcated lane or signify road works ahead. Their presence suggests potential hazards or ongoing road work, requiring the ego car to stay clear of the delineated area to avoid any possible dangers.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the traffic scene, suggesting their absence in this specific driving context."
