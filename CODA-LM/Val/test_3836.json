        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects that are influencing driving conditions. Firstly, there is a yellow taxi and a white vehicle parked on the left side of the road, which are partially obstructing the lane. This situation suggests that a vehicle may need to adjust its position slightly to the right to safely pass by these parked vehicles while staying within the lane boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white bus ahead that is occupying both the leftmost lane and the middle lane, and it appears to be either stationary or moving very slowly. This could indicate that the bus is in the process of picking up or dropping off passengers, or it could be reacting to traffic conditions. Drivers behind the bus should be prepared to either slow down or change lanes, depending on whether they can maintain their speed and have a clear lane to move into.\n\nFurthermore, blue traffic cones have been placed to direct vehicles into the far left lane. This arrangement of cones suggests that there may be road construction, lane closures, or the need to navigate around the parked vehicles mentioned earlier, requiring lanes to merge or change.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."

At the same time, be aware of the potential movements of other vehicles around the bus. It is recommended to maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared to stop if the bus is picking up or dropping off passengers.
