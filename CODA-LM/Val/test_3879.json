There is a green construction vehicle mounted on the back of a white truck directly in the ego car's lane, moving in the same direction and occupying the full width of the lane. This necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and potentially preparing for a lane change. Ahead of the ego car in the left lane, a white van moving in the same direction may necessitate a lane change to maintain a steady speed.\n\nAdditionally, multiple cars are moving in adjacent lanes to the right, which may affect the ego car's ability to safely change lanes due to their proximity and speed. A red heavy vehicle is on the overpass, moving perpendicularly to the ego car's direction, but it does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions since it is on a different roadway.\n\nSeveral cars are in the left lane moving in the same direction as the ego car, with some at a standstill and others moving slowly, causing potential risks of sudden braking. There is also a green combine harvester being transported on a flatbed truck ahead in the right lane, which could reduce visibility and may also move more slowly, necessitating a possible lane change.\n\nMoreover, orange traffic cones are present on the left side of the road, indicating lane closures ahead. These cones suggest changes in the traffic pattern, lane reductions, or active road work, which may require the ego car to merge or slow down."

The future driving behavior of the ego car would involve maintaining a safe following distance due to the size and weight of the construction vehicle, which may affect its braking distance and maneuverability. Additionally, sudden turns or stops by the mixer truck could lead to potential hazards, prompting the ego car to stay alert and prepared to react.",
