The first is an oncoming car in the opposite lane that has its headlights turned on, which could cause vision problems for others due to glare. The second vehicle is directly ahead in the same lane, and its brake lights are on, indicating that it is slowing down or coming to a stop. This requires attentiveness from the following drivers and may necessitate deceleration to maintain a safe driving distance. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that have been described or that affect driving behavior in the image."

Caution is advised while driving due to possible brief visibility issues caused by the headlights of oncoming vehicles. If safe to do so, it is suggested to follow lane-change yielding laws to avoid emergency vehicles, and be ready to stop in response to traffic lights and potential emergency service obstructions. Given the presence of cyclists on the right, the vehicle should reduce speed and prepare to yield.",
