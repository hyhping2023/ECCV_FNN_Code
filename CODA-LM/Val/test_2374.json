Due to the size and operational nature of such vehicles, it usually moves slower than regular traffic. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates that there might be construction work nearby, or it is in transit to a construction site. In either case, it suggests the potential for unexpected stops or slow movement, which requires other vehicles, including the ego car, to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for possible delays or obstacles in the path.",

Additionally, caution should be exercised to keep a safe distance from the partially encroaching truck. Checking the ego car's mirrors and blind spots for any other vehicles switching lanes due to the truck's position is advised. The ego car should wait for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding, ensuring that the truck has either fully occupied its own lane or proceeded ahead, clearing the path."
