Notably, there is a white car on the right and several cars in the distance on the left side, along with a yellow van. These parked vehicles reduce the available lane width for the ego car and could potentially open doors or pull out unexpectedly, which requires careful maneuvering and increased attention.\n\nPedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk to the right, with one individual walking parallel to the road. Although they are not currently crossing the street, they should be monitored in case they decide to cross at an unexpected location. Since pedestrians close to the curbside could enter the road, the ego car needs to be vigilant and prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nThe traffic image also includes a blue directional sign indicating a fork in the road ahead, a right turn lane, and a pedestrian crossing. Additionally, there is an orange diamond-shaped sign that likely signals construction or road work ahead. These signs suggest that the ego car must be ready to follow right-of-way rules, watch for pedestrians, and anticipate changes in traffic patterns due to the potential road work.\n\nLastly, there are piles of boxes, bags, and possibly discarded items on the sidewalk to the right, adjacent to the driving lane. While these objects are not currently in the driving lane, they could become a hazard if any items were to fall or be thrown onto the road, so caution is advised.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, so these categories do not require attention in this scenario."
