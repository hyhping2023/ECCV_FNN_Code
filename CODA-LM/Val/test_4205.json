On the left side, an orange backhoe loader is present, indicating ongoing construction or road work; this machinery takes up the lane, requiring our vehicle to either safely switch lanes or reduce speed. Alongside the construction area, on the right, there's a barrier fence extending from behind the construction vehicles, marking off the construction zone from the road and urging drivers to watch for any unpredictable obstructions or access points by the barrier. Additionally, the streetscape includes streetlights, trees, and roadside signs on both sides of the road that currently do not impede or influence driving conditions; nevertheless, constant vigilance is advised to accommodate any abrupt changes."

The vehicle must also pay attention to any temporary traffic signs or signals that may arise due to road construction and comply accordingly. Continue to monitor the situation and adjust driving behavior as needed to maintain safety and abide by traffic regulations. As the vehicle approaches the construction area, it should maintain a moderate speed and be prepared to respond to the traffic light status that it is about to encounter. Ensure a safe distance is kept from cars parked on the right to prevent potential conflicts from car doors opening or pedestrians suddenly emerging from between parked cars. It is advised to continuously monitor the construction vehicles and obstacle zones to be ready to react to any sudden movements. Stay alert for workers or pedestrians who may approach the construction vehicles, particularly as their presence could indicate nearby work activities. Keep a sufficient safety distance from any vehicles ahead to allow time to respond to any unforeseen events. Additionally, be prepared to slow down if any movement is detected from the construction area.",
