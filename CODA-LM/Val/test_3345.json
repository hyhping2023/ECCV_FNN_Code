Firstly, there is a white vehicle on the right side, which is only partially visible and appears to be parked. Although this vehicle does not pose an immediate threat, it should be kept under observation in case it makes an unexpected movement. Additionally, there is a golden vehicle parked in the distance, in front of a building with green signage. This vehicle is stationary and located off the roadway, so it does not directly affect the current driving decisions, but it is important to maintain visual clearance.\n\nA motorcyclist is also present in the center of the image, moving diagonally from the right side to the left across the road. This motorcyclist is an active road user who influences the traffic flow, necessitating that the ego vehicle either yields or adjusts its speed to prevent a collision.\n\nOn the side of the road, there are round concrete barriers aligned in a row. These barriers serve as a visual guide to the boundary of the road space and must be avoided by keeping a safe lateral distance.\n\nLastly, there are several spherical bollards on the sides of the road. While these bollards do not directly affect the ego vehicle's path, they mark the boundaries of the drivable area and should be monitored to ensure a safe distance is maintained.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this image."

It serves as a visual and physical barrier to vehicles to prevent them from entering specific areas. The presence of a bollard will influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by indicating that it should not drive over or across the delineated boundary where the bollard is located. The ego car driver should remain vigilant to ensure that the correct pathway is adhered to, avoiding any areas that are separated by such barriers.",

The driver should reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary to allow the motorcyclist to pass safely. It is also important to remain within the drivable area, avoid the bollards, and maintain a safe distance from the round concrete barriers on the side of the road. Continuous monitoring of the motorcyclist's trajectory is important to react appropriately to their movements. Since other road users and objects present are not affecting the drivable path, no other immediate actions are necessary."
