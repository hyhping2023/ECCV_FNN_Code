On the road ahead, an oncoming vehicle is detected in the opposite lane with its headlights on, indicating active traffic flow in that direction. This presence requires heightened situational awareness and could limit our vehicle's potential maneuvering options. Additionally, there are several vehicles parked on the right side of the road, indicating that the lane usage is somewhat restricted and could be blocked for certain maneuvers.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of traffic cones along the center of the road constitutes a modified driving environment. The cones are in place to separate lanes or serve as a temporary boundary within the roadway. As a result, the drivable area has been reduced and lanes have been narrowed, demanding careful driving from autonomous vehicles to ensure safety and compliance with the changed road conditions.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are observed in this scene, so these categories do not factor into the driving behavior in this current image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please drive carefully as the roads are wet and rescue vehicles may be parked due to roadworks or incidents, requiring you to slow down. Observe the movements of motorcycles closely and be ready to adjust your lane position if necessary, ensuring a safe distance from obstructing and parked vehicles. Be prepared for the possibility of bright-colored vehicles stopping suddenly due to traffic conditions ahead. Remain alert to any new signs, signals, or sudden changes in traffic patterns. Considering that rescue vehicles may indicate roadworks or emergencies, and the presence of traffic cones, the vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to change lanes if needed. Additionally, maintain a safe distance from motorcycles and be aware that pedestrians or workers might approach parked motorcycles. The headlights and taillights of other vehicles may provide clues about traffic flow and potential obstacles ahead. Be prepared to follow temporary traffic instructions or signals from road workers.",
