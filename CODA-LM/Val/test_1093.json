A white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, oriented in the same direction as the ego car, with no apparent activity. This parked car narrows the usable width of the road for the ego car and could potentially start moving or have its doors open, posing a risk of collision.\n2. A white hatchback car is parked ahead on the left side, facing away from the ego car. This car is also parked and should be monitored for movement as the ego car passes by.\n3. A blue hatchback is visible ahead, parked on the left side, facing the opposite direction of the ego car. Although it is stationary, the presence of this vehicle could indicate that this is an area where vehicles may enter or exit parking spots, requiring caution from the ego car.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is:\nA pedestrian with a pushcart and child on the sidewalk to the right, while a dog is on the road ahead of the ego car. The pedestrian is not immediately in the path of the vehicle but should be monitored in case they enter the road. The dog on the road presents an immediate potential hazard that requires the driver to slow down and be prepared to stop.\n\nFor traffic signs:\nDirectional road signs are affixed high on a post to the left of the road, indicating through lanes and turning options. These signs help the ego car navigate upcoming intersections or lane changes and should be observed for traffic flow adjustments.\n\nA barrier:\nThere is a road barrier diagonally positioned on the right sidewalk near the parked white sedan. The barrier appears to be present for maintenance or construction purposes and does not directly affect the vehicle path, but suggests the possibility of nearby activity that could impact road use.\n\nFinally, there is another object:\nA bus shelter is on the sidewalk to the right of the scene. While the bus shelter itself does not directly affect the driving behavior, the area may be associated with pedestrians alighting from a bus or waiting for a bus, who could step onto the road unexpectedly."

The vehicle should slow down, prepare to stop if necessary, and monitor the dog's movement, ensuring that it does not come into the path of the car. Additionally, keep a safe distance from the parked sedan on the right side to avoid any collision if it suddenly moves or if a door opens. Lastly, remain vigilant for any pedestrians that might transition from the sidewalk onto the road near the bus shelter and parking sign area. The directional signs must be observed to plan for any required lane changes or turns ahead."
