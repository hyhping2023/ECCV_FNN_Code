The crane truck's significant size and its position directly in front necessitate that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and speed. Additionally, a white and green bus is traveling in a lane to the left of the ego car, moving parallel and slightly ahead. This bus may change lanes or stop to pick up passengers, requiring the ego car to potentially adjust its speed or position.\n\nAlthough the traffic light is not visible in the image, this lack of information means the ego car must be prepared to react to potential changes in traffic light signals at upcoming intersections. White barriers are positioned on the right side of the road, separating the roadway from the pedestrian area. These barriers confine the driving area and restrict the ego car from moving outside the designated lanes."

Stay aware of the possibility of encountering traffic lights and adjust speed accordingly. Keep within the marked lanes, taking note of barriers that indicate boundaries of the driving area. Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared to slow down or stop if the vehicle makes unexpected movements. Monitor the bus to the left for any signs of it stopping or changing lanes and be ready to adjust speed or switch lanes if needed. Keep clear of the barriers on the right and stay within the marked lanes."
