This stationary bus may obscure visibility for any potential pedestrians or vehicles that may emerge from ahead of it, suggesting the possibility of pedestrians around the bus due to loading or unloading passengers. Additionally, various cars are parked on the side of the road, including a silver car positioned perpendicular to the ego car and facing to the right. These parked cars might obstruct the view of the road ahead, and there is a risk of pedestrians stepping out from between them unexpectedly. The silver car's position might indicate it is parking or preparing to enter traffic.\n\nA group of pedestrians is visible near the stationary bus on the left, who are likely crossing the road or waiting to cross. Multiple pedestrians are also walking near the parked bus on the side of the road. These pedestrians are unpredictable and may enter the roadway, which means the ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to stop.\n\nOn the right side of the road, traffic cones are positioned, indicating a possible lane closure or road work ahead. These cones are placed in a line, narrowing the driving lane on the right, suggesting a potential obstruction. The ego car may need to maintain or reduce speed and possibly change lanes if necessary, as the cones may indicate a road hazard or construction zone.\n\nLastly, a dustbin is positioned on the sidewalk to the right side of the image, beside the road, but not obstructing the road. While the dustbin does not directly affect the drive path, it suggests the presence of pedestrian activity and could obscure the visibility of pedestrians, so it should be monitored for any unexpected movements from nearby pedestrians or animals."

Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe speed and readiness to stop or maneuver. Keep an eye on the silver car for any signs of movement as it may enter traffic. Be prepared to change lanes if the traffic cones indicate a road closure or obstruction in the right lane. Continually check for pedestrians or cyclists that may be obscured by the bus as the ego vehicle passes. Maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles on the left to avoid any unforeseen doors opening or pedestrians emerging from in front of parked cars. Continue to observe the general road conditions and traffic for any other changes. Proceed with caution, maintain reduced speed and be prepared to stop for pedestrians that might emerge from behind the parked bus or any parked vehicles. The ego vehicle should also shift slightly to the left within the driving lane to distance itself from the parked cars and the traffic cones on the right."
