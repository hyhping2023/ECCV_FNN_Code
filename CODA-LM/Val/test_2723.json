It appears stationary or moving slowly, as indicated by the lack of motion blur and the clear visibility of its rear lights and license plate. Its position relative to the ego car suggests that it is either parked on the side of the road or driving in the same direction. In response, the ego car should maintain a safe distance if the vehicle is in motion, or move slightly to the left while passing if it is parked, ensuring it does not enter the opposing traffic lane.",

The headlights should be properly adjusted to ensure visibility of the road ahead without dazzling other road users. It's also vital to keep an observing eye for any pedestrians that might be around the parked cars, even though none are visible at the moment. Maintain a safe following distance from any vehicle in front to compensate for the low visibility conditions. Drive at a speed suitable for the visibility conditions and be prepared for unexpected movements from the parked vehicles."
