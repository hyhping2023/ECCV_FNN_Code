These barriers restrict maneuvering space to the left and may indicate an industrial or construction zone.\n\n- **Other Objects**: Large industrial cable spools are positioned on the right side of the road but off the drivable surface. While not currently an obstruction, their presence should be noted in case they are moved or otherwise obstruct the road."
