These vehicles are stationary and do not pose an immediate dynamic threat, but they reduce the available width of the road and may obstruct pedestrians or hide other potential dangers.\n\n2. **Barriers**: There are construction obstacles in the distance on the left side, with temporary fencing installed. These obstacles indicate that there might be construction nearby which could affect the road layout, necessitating reducing speed and heightening caution. Additionally, there's a black-and-yellow striped barrier on the right side, indicating the road corner or edge. These barriers serve as visual cues to maintain a safe distance from the edge of the driving lane and to carefully navigate the upcoming road curves.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: On the left side, there are sections of the fence along the road covered with netting. This signifies a boundary and does not encroach upon the road, but it should be noted that the failure of any material could obstruct the path. Also, there's a utility pole by the roadside that marks the boundaries of the road and does not pose an immediate danger."

    "driving_suggestion": "Proceed with caution, reducing speed to safely navigate any potential hazards that may arise, such as due to parked vehicles and the narrowing of the road indicated by traffic cones or potential construction areas. Pay close attention to pedestrians who might emerge from between parked vehicles. Ensure that while traversing sections where the road width is reduced, your vehicle stays within the traffic pathway marked by cones. Be prepared to stop or follow detour signs due to traffic cones and construction barriers. Remain highly vigilant for individuals entering the lane from the right side, as well as construction workers or vehicles that may enter the roadway.",
