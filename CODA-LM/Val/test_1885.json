This can impair visibility and reduce traction, increasing stopping distances. Additionally, a vehicle with hazard lights is parked on the right side of the road, slightly obstructing the lane. This suggests a potential hazard or temporary stop, requiring the ego car to possibly change lanes for safe passage.\n\nSeveral motorcycles and bicycles are parked on the right side of the road. This indicates the potential presence of pedestrians or cyclists who might suddenly enter the roadway, necessitating cautious driving. Some details are unclear due to low resolution and lighting conditions, suggesting the presence of potential road users near the parked vehicle or roadside, hence caution is advised.\n\nNo visible traffic signs can be discerned due to the image quality and angle, meaning the ego car must rely on other cues such as road markings and the behavior of other road users. No traffic lights are visible in the scene, indicating they are not influencing the current driving behavior.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the lane, leading to a merging pattern towards the left. This implies a road narrowing or diversion ahead, requiring the ego car to merge left and reducing available driving space.\n\nAlthough there are no visible barriers, there is glare from the lights of the vehicle with hazard lights, which may obscure vision. This reduced visibility necessitates driving with additional caution to recognize road users or obstacles effectively."
