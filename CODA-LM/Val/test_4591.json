        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers present. However, attention is drawn towards the presence of traffic cones and other objects indicative of roadwork or construction activities. Specifically, red and white traffic cones are placed on both the right and left sides of the road. The cones on the right signal that the area may be a construction or danger zone, suggesting that autonomous vehicles should slow down and be prepared to navigate around possible obstacles or restricted areas. Similarly, a traffic cone on the left indicates the presence of ongoing road construction or zones to avoid, implying that vehicles should steer clear of the cones and any potential hazards they mark. Adding to this, temporary structures and construction-related equipment are observed on both sides of the road. The collective presence of these objects alongside the traffic cones indicates construction activities that could influence road conditions, necessitating a deceleration of vehicle speed to ensure safety."

Maintain lane discipline when passing by traffic cones on the right side of the road, to ensure safe navigation around possible road construction or obstacles.

            "description and explanation": "The object is a traffic cone, commonly used on roads and in driving scenarios to mark areas that are off-limits to vehicles, guide traffic in a certain direction, or indicate hazards. It is typically orange with white horizontal stripes for high visibility. The cone suggests that there may be road work ahead, an obstruction on the road, or a change in the traffic pattern. When driving, one should reduce speed and proceed with caution when approaching and passing a traffic cone, as well as be prepared for potential diversions or alterations in the available driving lanes.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a safety device, typically cone-shaped, made of a thermoplastic material with a reflective strip. Its bright color and reflectivity draw attention to itself, signaling to drivers the need to be cautious and usually indicating that they should move away from a certain area due to roadwork, obstacles, or potential hazards ahead. For the ego car, seeing a traffic cone would mean that the driver should slow down and be prepared to alter their course to avoid a zone of caution or construction.",
