        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is one vehicle detectedâ€”a car parked on the right side of the road with its headlights on, facing towards the ego-vehicle. The fact that its headlights are active and positioned to possibly enter the roadway means the ego vehicle should proceed with caution as this car may start moving into traffic.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users or traffic signs present in this image, there are traffic cones that require attention. Several cones are aligned, partially obstructing the right side of the road, which directly affects the path of the ego car. These cones suggest a closed or restricted lane and serve to direct traffic away from potential hazards or ongoing roadwork.\n\nAccompanying the traffic cones, a barrier is also in place on the right-side sidewalk, reinforcing the restricted area's boundaries. This ensures that the ego vehicle and other road users do not drive onto the sidewalk or into the sectioned-off zone, enhancing safety.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes other objects that impact the driving conditions. A large and brightly-lit electronic sign positioned on the right side could be displaying important information or warnings for drivers, necessitating close attention to any communicated changes or road conditions. Moreover, the presence of bright lighting sources like street lamps and various reflections create glare which may affect the perception systems of the ego vehicle, potentially reducing visibility due to lens flare or glare and requiring careful navigation."
