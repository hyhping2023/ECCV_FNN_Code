On our left, there is a red dump truck, either in motion or stationary, positioned with its rear end closer to our vehicle. It poses a risk by taking up the lane next to us, potentially obstructing our view and increasing the likelihood of a collision due to its size and merging movements.\n\nDirectly ahead in our lane, we can see a cement mixer truck moving forward, which may require a longer following distance as it could slow down for turns or at intersections. Its substantial presence might also block our line of sight, hindering our ability to foresee upcoming traffic conditions.\n\nRegarding road signs, a blue circular sign with a white arrow pointing diagonally front-right is situated on the left. This indicates that vehicles in that lane must turn right, prompting us to position ourselves appropriately to comply if that's the intended route.\n\nAs for the traffic lights at the upcoming intersection, they present a green signal, allowing for both straight travel and right turns. This means we are authorized to continue through the intersection as long as the path is clear.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned, indicating that these categories are not present in the scene or not affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this instance."

    "driving_suggestion": "Based on the traffic signals and the conditions ahead, your vehicle can safely continue forward while maintaining a safe distance from the cement mixer. If the cement mixer begins to turn right, your vehicle should be prepared to slow down or stop to ensure it does not overtake on its right side. Moreover, your vehicle should pay attention to the area marked with cones in the center of the intersection and follow any revised lane markings or instructions given by traffic directors. Maintain a safe distance from the cement truck ahead to achieve sufficient visibility and reaction time. Be ready to respond to potential lateral movements of the red truck to the left and continue to monitor its position. Ensure you stay in the correct lane to comply with mandatory turning signs (if applicable to your intended route). Proceed with caution at green lights, mindful of the traffic conditions and potentially unseen pedestrians.",
