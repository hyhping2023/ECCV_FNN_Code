        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present. However, there are notable traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers that influence driving behavior.\n\nA blue pedestrian crossing sign is visible on the left-hand side of the road, indicating a designated crossing area for pedestrians. Additionally, there is a yellow sign with '60' displayed on it, positioned further ahead on the right side of the road, likely indicating a speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour for this section. The presence of the pedestrian crossing sign suggests a potential area where pedestrians may be crossing or present, requiring drivers to exercise caution. The speed limit sign informs drivers, including the ego car, of the maximum legal speed they can travel on this stretch of road.\n\nA series of orange and white traffic cones are arranged diagonally across the road, starting from the left side and extending toward the center. This arrangement suggests a lane closure or roadworks ahead, indicating that the ego car should not cross into the area delineated by the cones. This setup is likely intended to channel traffic away from a hazard or construction zone.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, barriers are positioned to the left of the cones, further reinforcing the boundary of the area that vehicles should avoid. These barriers serve as a physical marker, emphasizing the path that the vehicle should not take and complementing the guidance provided by the traffic cones.\n\nIn summary, the traffic scene is marked by clear indications for drivers to adjust their behavior due to a pedestrian crossing area, a specified speed limit, and roadworks or hazards indicated by traffic cones and barriers."
