Firstly, there is a black sedan traveling ahead in the same lane and direction as our vehicle, which influences traffic flow and necessitates potential lane changes or speed adjustments for our self-driving car. Secondly, a silver van is present in the lane to the immediate left of our vehicle, which restricts the self-driving car's ability to safely change lanes to the left.\n\nMoreover, pedestrians are visible on the right side of the road, beyond the parked vehicles. These pedestrians may cause the autonomous vehicle to drive more cautiously, especially since they might attempt to cross the street.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the traffic image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the black car ahead. If the black car suddenly turns or stops, you should be prepared to slow down or stop. Increase your vigilance towards pedestrians near the road and anticipate their intention to cross. Due to the surrounding vehicles, especially the silver van on the left, exercise caution when changing lanes. The vehicle must not enter any areas marked with \"No Entry\" signs and should pay attention to traffic lights and signs ahead, even if they are not clearly visible or identifiable in the current image. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and watch its brake lights to guard against sudden stops. Closely monitor the white SUV on the left for potential lane changes. Be aware of unexpected actions from the gray van on the left. Pay attention to pedestrians at intersections and be ready to yield. Observe the blue overhead signs and red side traffic signs for navigation cues, and comply with local traffic regulations. Stay alert to any changes at intersections, including potential crossing vehicles.",

            "description and explanation": "An outdoor billboard with a blue surface is elevated on a pole on the roadside. Its large size suggests it is designed to display advertisements or information visible from a distance. In a driving scenario, while the billboard might contain relevant information, it should not be a primary focus for the driver of the ego car, as attention should remain on the road and the traffic conditions. The structure poses no immediate influence on driving behavior, unless it obstructs the driver's field of vision or distracts from the road.",
