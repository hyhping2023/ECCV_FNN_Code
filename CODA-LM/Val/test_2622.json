        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, no vehicles or vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present. Additionally, there are no visible traffic signs or traffic lights. However, there are several orange traffic cones with reflective stripes positioned diagonally from left to right across the screen. The arrangement of these cones likely signifies a lane closure or diversion, suggesting that there could be road construction or an impassable section of the roadway. Consequently, these cones necessitate a change in lane position for vehicles navigating this area.\n\nFurthermore, there appears to be a large obstacle located on the upper right side of the image, which may be a gate or a boom barrier, extending across the road. This barrier is indicative of a closed road or one that has restricted access, and therefore, it requires vehicles to come to a stop or take a detour to continue their journey. No other objects are observed that affect the driving environment."

Adjust your lane position, avoid sections marked by traffic cones, pay attention to any road workers or unmarked obstacles, and continue to look out for any additional signs or signals that may appear ahead. Your vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop or change lanes as directed, as barriers ahead indicate the road may be closed.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is typically colored in highly visible shades such as orange, red, or lime green, and often has a reflective strip to increase visibility during nighttime or low-light conditions. Such cones are used to mark out areas where roadwork is occurring or to designate traffic lanes that are closed for safety reasons. The presence of a traffic cone indicates that the ego vehicle should maneuver to avoid it, typically by changing lanes or adjusting its position within the same lane to maintain a safe distance from the work area or hazards associated with the cone's placement.",

It is used to guide vehicles and alert drivers to specific conditions on the road, such as construction zones, hazards, or changes in traffic patterns. In this case, the ego car must steer clear of the traffic cone, indicating either a lane closure or a need to maneuver around an obstacle on the road. The driver should proceed with caution, potentially reducing speed and being aware of any workers or machinery that might be present in the area.",
