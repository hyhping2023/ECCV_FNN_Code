        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a white car parked on the side of the road with all of its doors, including the trunk, open. These open doors are partially blocking the driving lane, which poses a potential hazard as they extend into the path of traffic. This could cause unexpected movements from individuals around the car and disrupt the normal flow of traffic as well as influence the movement path of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is an adult male standing between the open front and rear doors on the driver's side of the parked car. He is facing away from the road and appears to be engaged with an object in his hands. The proximity of the person to the open doors and his engagement with the object suggests that he may be unpredictable in his movements. As a result, the autonomous vehicle must remain alert and be prepared to stop or safely maneuver around him if he were to step into the driving lane unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, there is an indistinct object that the pedestrian is placing into the trunk of the parked car. It is likely to be personal belongings or some sort of cargo. Although the object itself does not influence the driving behavior directly, the pedestrian's actions related to loading the car might lead to sudden movements, which would require the autonomous vehicle to monitor and respond accordingly.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers or any other objects noted in the image that affect driving behavior."

It is crucial to monitor the individual's movements and be ready to react if they step into the driving lane. The ego car should also be alert for other traffic that may be approaching from behind or from the opposite direction as the road users react to the parked car and its open doors. If traffic conditions allow, the ego car may need to change lanes to avoid the obstruction safely, but only after confirming it is safe to do so."
