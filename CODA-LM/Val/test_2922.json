Reduce your speed due to the wet road conditions, and maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and traffic cones. Be prepared to stop or adjust your lane position if necessary. As you approach the intersection, further assess the road conditions and confirm the status of the traffic lights. Pay attention to whether parked vehicles are moving.

The appearance of a traffic cone suggests a potential hazard or alteration in the expected traffic pattern, such as road work, an obstacle, or a temporary traffic reroute.
