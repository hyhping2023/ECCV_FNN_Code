This situation requires the ego car to maintain an appropriate following distance and potentially adjust its speed to match the vehicle in front.\n\nDespite the rainy night and low visibility, there are no pedestrians or cyclists visible in the image. However, the conditions suggest that the ego car should remain cautious, especially in areas where such vulnerable road users might be present, as they are more difficult to spot under these circumstances.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a reflective road warning sign is visible, indicating a diversion or caution ahead. This sign is crucial for alerting the ego car to potential hazards or changes in driving conditions that lie ahead, necessitating a reduction in speed and increased vigilance.\n\nA traffic light displaying green is observed in the distance, indicating that the ego car may proceed, provided the path is clear. The green light suggests the right-of-way is with the ego car, but it must remain wary of the vehicle directly in front and ensure it is safe to move forward.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the ego car, likely marking a construction zone or a lane closure. The presence of these cones may necessitate a lane change or prepare the ego car for narrower lanes ahead.\n\nA warning sign or barrier on the right side of the road signals potential roadwork or hazards. This warning advises the ego car to possibly slow down and be ready for changes such as lane closures or the presence of workers on the road.\n\nLastly, a small, unidentifiable object is spotted on the road in front of the ego car. Any unknown object on the roadway represents a potential hazard, and the ego car must be ready to safely navigate around it, avoiding sudden movements that could compromise safety."
