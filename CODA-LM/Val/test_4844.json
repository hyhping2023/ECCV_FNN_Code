On the right side, vehicles have some parts extending into the lane, limiting the available road width and requiring careful navigation to avoid collisions. Various vehicles of different colors and types, ranging from cars to SUVs, are stationary on the left side. While these parked vehicles pose no immediate dynamic threat, vigilance is necessary for any sudden opening car doors or pedestrians crossing between them.\n\nIn addition, there are traffic cones placed in front of the parked vehicles on the roadside. These black and yellow cones may indicate temporary road conditions or construction, necessitating that drivers reduce speed and proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the road is an enclosed area that appears to be the entrance to a residential or commercial building. Though it does not directly affect the autonomous vehicle's route, it is essential to be attentive to any moving vehicles or pedestrians entering the road from the main gate."

    "driving_suggestion": "When passing parked vehicles, the driver should reduce speed, especially when some vehicles slightly protrude onto the road. Maintain a safe distance from the parked vehicles to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances, such as a car door suddenly opening or pedestrians walking out from between vehicles. At the same time, be ready for possible changes in the lane ahead or construction work, pay attention to any changes indicated by traffic cones, and stay alert for any signs or signals that may be placed further along the road to guide vehicles through the altered traffic conditions. Be cautious when driving forward, as parked vehicles on the left may obstruct pedestrians or suddenly open doors. Watch for any changes around the traffic cones on the right and remain within their set boundaries. Adhere to the normal road rules, and keep the speed appropriate for the surrounding environment that appears urban. Always be prepared for sudden obstacles or road users that may appear in blind spots or not visible in the image.",
