        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic environment, there is a significant presence of a large truck on the left side, with its flatbed trailer occupying the neighboring lane and positioned perpendicularly to the direction of travel of our vehicle. The sheer size of the truck and the possibility of falling debris or objects create a potential hazard that needs to be monitored carefully. The fact that such a large vehicle is on the road nearby may indicate construction activities, suggesting the need for increased vigilance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier situated ahead that seems to be part of a fence wall, topped with what looks like construction or protective netting. This barrier delineates the boundary of the road from an adjacent property and is suggestive of ongoing construction. This can influence both the road conditions and the behavior of other road users, necessitating further consideration in navigation and safety measures. \n\nNo other categories of road users—such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects—are present in the current traffic scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from trucks in adjacent lanes and be vigilant for potential hazards they may obscure or any maneuvers they might execute. Observe the truck's signal lights to detect any signs of lane changes or turns, and be prepared accordingly. Due to the presence of the truck and its cargo, along with possible signs of construction nearby such as roadblocks, and the lack of traffic signs or signals indicating adherence to standard road rules, it is advised to drive cautiously, following speed limits and yielding rules.",

            "description and explanation": "This is a large industrial vehicle commonly referred to as a flatbed trailer, which is transporting a wide load, possibly a section of pre-constructed concrete for infrastructure development. The vehicle occupies a significant portion of the road, leaving limited space for maneuvering around it. Considering the size and nature of the load, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid any possible debris falling from the load and should be prepared for potential abrupt stops or slow movement by the trailer.",
