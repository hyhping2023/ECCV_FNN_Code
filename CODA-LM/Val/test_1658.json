This vehicle reduces the available width of the road, requiring us to adjust our trajectory to maintain a safe distance when passing by.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: A pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk in the same direction as our vehicle on the left side. Although they are on the sidewalk, they should not affect driving behavior unless they step onto the road.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: On the left edge of the road ahead, a silver sedan is parked beside a traffic cone. The cone indicates potential road construction or danger ahead, advising drivers to proceed with caution and possibly change lanes if necessary.\n\n- **Other Objects**: There is a phone booth on the right sidewalk, which does not obstruct the road. However, attention should be paid to its presence in case a pedestrian walks out from behind it.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers are observed in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "This vehicle should be driven with caution, maintaining a safe speed to respond to any sudden movements that motorcyclists or pedestrians may exhibit. When passing parked vehicles, ensure a sufficient gap and stay alert for any activity between them. If traffic cones are detected, be prepared for unexpected road conditions or construction areas that may lie ahead. In such urban environments, continual observation is vital to safe driving. Also, be mindful of any unforeseen actions by pedestrians near phone booths.",

It usually indicates areas that are off-limits or where drivers need to slow down or be cautious of potential hazards. Seeing this object, the driver of the ego car should be alert for possible construction, road work, or other disruptions ahead and be prepared to adjust their driving accordingly.",
