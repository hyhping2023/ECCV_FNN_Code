This vehicle is considered significant because it obscures the view and requires the autonomous car to maintain a safe following distance, given that it limits maneuverability. Additionally, there are several large trash bins positioned right next to the curb on the right side of the road. These bins are important to consider as potential obstacles; they must be monitored to ensure they do not move into the driving lane and that the autonomous vehicle avoids any collision with them. There are no other road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, reported in this scene."

If necessary, it should monitor the surrounding traffic to find safe opportunities to change lanes, and pay attention to the conditions of the wet and slippery road surface, adjusting speed in a timely manner to ensure safety. Given the density of the surrounding vehicles, caution is advised when changing lanes. Additionally, our vehicle should stay alert and be aware of any changes in the location of the garbage bins on the right side.",
