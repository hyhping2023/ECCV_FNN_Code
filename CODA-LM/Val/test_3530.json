        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image viewed, there is a large truck ahead in our lane that has stopped on the right side, which is partially blocking the lane. The presence of the truck may necessitate a change in driving behavior, such as a possible lane change or speed adjustment to maintain safety due to the reduced lane availability. Additionally, there is a blue circular traffic sign with a white arrow on it, indicating a mandatory direction of travel, which implies that all traffic, including the ego vehicle, must follow the direction pointed to by the arrow.\n\nMoreover, a sequence of traffic cones has been placed on the right side of the road around a construction area. These cones are an indication that there are temporary alterations in the traffic flow or the presence of obstacles, signalling the need for drivers to stay vigilant and potentially switch lanes to circumvent the construction zone. Accompanying the traffic cones, there is a barrier or marker post with red and white stripes near the construction area, further indicating that access to a section of the road is prohibited due to what is likely construction activity. Drivers are cautioned to switch lanes if needed to avoid entering the restricted area.\n\nLastly, there are brown trash cans aligned behind the traffic cones on the right sidewalk. While these trash bins don't actively affect the driving decisions, it is important to monitor for any unexpected shifts in their position that might introduce them onto the road, thereby creating a hazard. All other categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and any other objects not described, are absent from the image and therefore do not require consideration in the summarization of the scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes to the left, safely passing the truck parked by the roadside and the construction zone, while obeying the upcoming red traffic signal, and coming to a complete stop if necessary. They should also be more alert to sudden changes that may be caused by road workers entering the lane and construction activities. Drivers should cautiously maneuver and properly steer to the left within the lane to avoid the towing vehicle, ensuring not to enter the oncoming traffic lane. Due to the slippery road surface, drivers should slow down and pay attention to any signs or changes within the work area, and be prepared to make a left turn as indicated by traffic signs. Drive carefully and be ready to change lanes to avoid the yellow truck parked on the right side. Follow the blue mandatory instruction signs and detour to the right as directed. Slow down due to the changes in road conditions caused by the slippery surface, and be prepared to merge if the lane narrows ahead due to obstacles and traffic cones.",
