This vehicle could potentially change lanes or slow down, requiring the ego vehicle to be aware and possibly adjust speed or lane position.\n   - A red car is visible in the opposite lane, moving in the opposite direction. There is no immediate action required, but the ego car should monitor the red car in case of any unexpected maneuvers.\n   - Various vehicles are in the background on the other side of the road. These do not immediately affect the ego car but are worth monitoring for changes in traffic dynamics.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - An adult pedestrian is crossing the road from right to left, pushing a stroller with a child in it, in front of the ego car. The pedestrian has priority, and the ego car must yield to let them cross safely.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - There is a traffic sign on the right indicating a junction ahead. This sign alerts the driver to potential vehicles and pedestrians emerging from the side street, requiring increased caution.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light directly in front of the ego car is green.

Once the pedestrian has cleared the crossing, the ego car can continue on its way in accordance with the green traffic light, while remaining cautious of the junction ahead and the potential for other vehicles to enter the intersection. Proceed with caution, giving priority to the pedestrian crossing the road. Maintain a safe following distance from the green car ahead. Continue to observe the red car on the adjacent lane for any potential lane changes. The green light allows movement, but pedestrian safety is the priority. Keep an eye out for any changes in the traffic light. Monitor the surroundings for any additional road users or changes in road conditions."
