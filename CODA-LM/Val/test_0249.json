There is also a parked white vehicle on the right shoulder, partially on the pavement, which constricts the available road space and requires cautious passing by the ego car for safe clearance.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, a pedestrian is walking in the same direction as traffic, necessitating monitoring in case they step onto the road. Also on the right shoulder, a person stands with their back to the road near a bicycle or light motorized vehicle, creating a risk due to their potential to enter the driving lane unexpectedly.\n\nAbove, traffic signs are in place, indicating no overtaking, and setting a speed limit of 40 km/h, requiring compliance from the ego car. However, the traffic light's state is not visible in the image, prompting the ego car to proceed with caution and be ready to react to possible changes based on the other vehicles' behavior.\n\nAdditionally, two red and white traffic cones on the right side of the road mark the driving area boundary and suggest a narrowing of the road, possibly hinting at nearby roadwork or a temporary obstacle. This requires the ego car to slow down and navigate safely through the reduced space. Lastly, red and white striped poles are present on the right side, signifying a division from the sidewalk, marking the drivable area's limit, and highlighting no-go zones for the ego car. \n\nThere are no other objects reported in the scene that would impact the driving decisions of the ego car."
