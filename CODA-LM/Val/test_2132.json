These barriers signal that traffic should detour to the right.

Pay close attention to other road users who may be temporarily invisible due to dim lighting, and be prepared to stop or take evasive actions at any moment. If possible, safely distance yourself from motorcycles and potential obstacles on the side of the road, leaving them ample space. Lastly, be aware of any debris on the road and avoid it to prevent damage to your vehicle. If necessary, use high beams to improve visibility, provided that it does not affect other road users.",
