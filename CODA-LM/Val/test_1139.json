Overtaking may not be possible due to the vehicle's width. This vehicle may act unpredictably due to its size and possible operations related to construction. Its presence may also reduce visibility ahead for the ego car."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a large yellow construction vehicle directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. It is equipped with a backhoe loader on top and displays visible company logos. The vast size of this vehicle requires that the ego car maintain a safe distance behind it since overtaking may not be possible given the vehicle occupies the full lane. The construction vehicle may move slowly or stop suddenly, additionally reducing the visibility for the ego car, which must be ready for unpredictable maneuvers related to construction activities.\n\nAlongside the roadway, there are multiple pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, with one particular individual walking close to the curb in the same direction as the traffic. The ego car must be vigilant around this pedestrian due to the risk of them stepping into the road, necessitating continual observation even though they aren't on the road at the moment.\n\nOverhead directional traffic signs provide lane information and destination details important for navigation purposes. While these signs don't directly change how the ego car drives at this exact moment, unless a lane change or turn is needed, they are critical for the vehicle's route planning, indicating which lane to use for the intended path of travel.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the traffic image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Monitor the pedestrian movement closely in case any pedestrians enter the roadway, reducing speed if necessary to ensure safety. Continue monitoring the road ahead for any traffic signs or changes in traffic conditions. If it becomes safe and legal to do so, consider changing lanes to overtake the large vehicle, provided it can be done without compromising the safety of road users or violating traffic laws. Use directional signs to position the ego car in the correct lane well ahead of time to make any necessary turns or exits."
