However, the image does contain barriers, specifically a series of cylindrical barriers located on the left side of the road. They are patterned in red and white, signifying an upcoming work zone. These barriers serve the purpose of alerting drivers to modifications in traffic patterns or road conditions, which in this case is likely due to construction activities."

Meanwhile, maintain your lane and decelerate. Due to construction potentially altering traffic patterns, be prepared to encounter workers or machinery ahead. Stay alert for any temporary road signs or signals set further along the road, and follow any directions. With reduced visibility and the possible presence of workers or equipment in the construction area, slow down and increase the following distance. Stay vigilant around the construction zone marked by obstacles, ready to respond to other road users who might suddenly enter the traffic lane.",

This barrier would indicate to the drivers to stay in the appropriate lane and to proceed with caution, particularly since it could be indicating a change in normal traffic patterns or the presence of workers or machinery on the road ahead.",
