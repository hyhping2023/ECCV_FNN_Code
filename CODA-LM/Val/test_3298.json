        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, various road users and objects are present which influence the driving dynamics and require careful consideration by the autonomous driving system.\n\nA single vehicle is present in the scene, identified as a large yellow maintenance vehicle. It is parked on the right side of the road with its boom extended towards an overpass. The current position and activity of this vehicle suggest that there is ongoing work, potentially impacting traffic flow and necessitating caution while navigating past this area.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users or traffic signs visible in this scenario, other elements significantly affect the driving environment.\n\nNotably, orange traffic cones have been positioned in front of the maintenance vehicle, on its right. These cones likely demarcate a work zone, signaling a change in traffic patterns or the presence of workers. This setup implies that the autonomous vehicle should decrease speed and be prepared to either stop or maneuver safely away from the indicated work zone.\n\nAdjacent to this setup, a series of green temporary fencing panels can be seen. These are placed on the right, effectively separating the sidewalk and the work zone from the roadway. The presence of these barriers indicates ongoing construction or maintenance efforts on the side of the road, and they serve to restrict access to areas that may pose dangers to unchecked entry.\n\nAdditionally, an object of interest is described as being partially obscured with a white tarp, situated on the right side near the truck. Although this object does not directly impede the driving path, it is part of the construction zone that the vehicle is passing by. It's an indicator of the broader context of work activities in the area, reinforcing the need for vigilance.\n\nOverall, the described scenario paints a picture of a section of road undergoing maintenance or construction work, featuring a maintenance vehicle, traffic cones, barriers, and additional objects indicating ongoing activities. These elements collectively signal the autonomous driving system to exercise increased caution, adapt its speed and be ready for potential alterations in the usual traffic flow to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations."

Change lanes if the current lane is obstructed by the maintenance operation and it's safe to do so, or follow any temporary road guidance. Continue to monitor the road conditions and watch for any additional signs or signals indicating further changes in traffic patterns due to construction or maintenance work. Proceed with caution along the left lane, maintaining a safe distance from the truck and cones on the right. Reduce speed due to wet road conditions, stay alert for potential movement from the construction zone, and be prepared to adjust the path if necessary. It is also important to watch for signs or signals from construction workers who might be present."
