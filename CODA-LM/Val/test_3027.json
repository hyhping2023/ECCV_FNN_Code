        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vehicles and one traffic sign that are noteworthy. The first vehicle is a white bus parked on the left side of the road, at a slight angle towards the shoulder, facing our direction with its right side parallel to the curb. The bus's position suggests it may be temporarily stopped to pick up or drop off passengers, which could lead to pedestrians stepping onto the road. It also partially blocks the lane, which might require a lane change to pass. The bus could obscure visibility and restrict movement, so extra caution is advised as pedestrians could appear from in front or behind the bus.\n\nThe second vehicle is a yellow construction vehicle parked on the right side of the road, adjacent to a parked car, with its front loading arm extending into the roadway. The presence of the construction vehicle implies there might be ongoing work or potential obstacles near the road, which could result in unexpected movement or debris on the roadway. Even though the vehicle is not moving, there is a risk it could start up or inadvertently move onto the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue indicator sign above the road on the right, which provides information about lane usage and directions. This sign is crucial for route planning and understanding lane divisions, although it does not require immediate action. It does not directly influence driving behavior but assists in vehicle navigation and preparing for lane changes if needed to follow the indicated direction.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to change lanes to the right when necessary to avoid lanes that are partially blocked due to buses stopping. At the same time, be vigilant for pedestrians who may enter the road near the bus. Attention should also be paid to construction loaders, which may indicate nearby workers or obstacles. It is advised to keep an eye on vehicles parked on the side of the road to prevent them from suddenly moving. Expect buses to stop and therefore maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Steer clear of the right edge of the lane and carefully pass parked construction loaders in case of potential movement. Observe traffic cones and stay alert for any work-related activities that might affect traffic flow. Regularly check for dynamic changes in road conditions or the behavior of static objects, which may affect driving decisions. Continue to drive cautiously and comply with road signs for navigation assistance. Maintain a moderate speed to ensure adequate reaction time. When preparing to drive around parked buses, check oncoming traffic and signal when needed to change lanes. Be prepared for pedestrians that might appear around stopped buses and any unforeseen changes due to construction vehicles and traffic cones. Keep a safe distance from vehicles and cones parked on the right side of the road and remain alert for any signals or personnel that may emerge from the cone-marked areas.",
