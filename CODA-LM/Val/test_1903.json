These vehicles vary in color and size and are positioned both near and far away. Their potential actions, such as slowing down, changing lanes, or stopping unexpectedly, necessitate the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and stay prepared for any sudden changes in traffic flow.\n\nMoreover, several vehicles are noticed in the adjacent left lane, including a white sedan and a white van among others; their potential lane changes could influence the ability of the ego car to switch lanes when needed.\n\nAn important traffic sign visible in this setting is a green overhead directional sign that provides lane and route directions, which will help the ego car with navigation and in making necessary lane adjustments for future exits or turns.\n\nOn the right side of the highway, starting from the midground and extending towards the horizon, a series of orange traffic cones are placed to demarcate a closed lane, indicating to the ego car that the right lane is out of service and signaling the need to stay in the current lane or make a lane change if required.\n\nLastly, solid barriers are present on both sides of the highway. These barriers prevent any crossing over or pedestrians from entering the carriageway, ensuring the stability of traffic flow and maintaining the direction on the highway.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in the current traffic image."

The ego car should also be aware of the overhead directional sign and upcoming junctions for any necessary lane adjustments. Continued vigilance is advised due to the presence of the lane restrictions indicated by the traffic cones."
