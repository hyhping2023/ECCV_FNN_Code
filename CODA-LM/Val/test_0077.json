        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a white van on the left side of the road, facing towards the ego car. The van is in a lane that could be for opposing traffic, which means the ego car needs to be cautious, especially if the van turns or if the ego car tries to pass. The presence of a green traffic light above the van indicates that vehicles in that lane, including the van, can proceed, influencing the ego car's decision to continue straight or turn.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are multiple vehicles parked, which narrows the available road space and could hide pedestrians or other hazards from the ego car's view. Ahead of the ego car, in the same lane, a silver car is driving, which means the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be ready for any sudden stops or changes in the silver car's speed.\n\nThere is a group of pedestrians on the right sidewalk, some near the crosswalk, suggesting they might want to cross soon. The ego car should watch them closely and be ready to yield. Additionally, a cyclist is riding in the same direction as the ego car on the left side, and the ego car should pass with care and keep a safe distance.\n\nThe road has pedestrian crossing signs on both sides, indicating a crossing area where the ego car should yield to pedestrians. Next to one of the signs, there is a right directional arrow, signaling that the road will curve to the right, which the ego car will need to follow.\n\nA green traffic light is visible on the left, above the white van, giving the right of way to traffic in that lane, but the ego car should still be cautious as it proceeds. Orange traffic cones are placed along the left edge of the road, suggesting there might be roadwork or a lane closure, and the ego car may need to merge or adjust its lane position accordingly.\n\nLastly, trees and bushes are on both sides of the road, which could limit visibility and conceal potential hazards like animals or pedestrians. There is also a dustbin on the right sidewalk near the pedestrian crossing, which doesn't affect the road but should be noted by the sensors for a complete environmental assessment."

Maintain a vigilant speed as approaching the pedestrian crossing, be prepared to yield to pedestrians, and monitor for any signals from the traffic light or movements from the van or parked vehicles. If necessary, merge safely to the right to navigate around the traffic cones. The ego car should proceed with caution, adjusting speed to prepare to stop for pedestrians at the crossing, and maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. While doing so, the ego car should also be prepared to safely pass the cyclist and the parked van while adhering to the marked deviation of the path as indicated by traffic signs and cones."
