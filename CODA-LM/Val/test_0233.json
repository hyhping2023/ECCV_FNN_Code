This vehicle directly affects the driving behavior of the ego car, as it determines the car's speed and the following distance to maintain safe driving conditions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, several pedestrians are present, positioned behind traffic cones. Some of these individuals are stationary while others are in motion, signaling a potentially active roadside situation. The presence of pedestrians near the roadway prompts the ego car to approach with caution, staying ready to stop and vigilant for any person who may unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nA blue rectangular traffic sign is situated on the left side of the road, parallel to the driving direction. This sign is informational, likely providing directions or locations, and does not have an immediate impact on the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are placed to the right of the ego car, acting as a barrier between the road and the pedestrians. These cones suggest there could be road work or an event taking place, requiring the ego car to remain within the lane markings and stay alert to potential changes in road conditions or unforeseen obstacles.\n\nFinally, a structure resembling a stone monument is positioned on the right side of the image, but it is situated away from the active driving area and does not influence the current driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nThe image does not contain any traffic lights or barriers that need to be considered in this context."
