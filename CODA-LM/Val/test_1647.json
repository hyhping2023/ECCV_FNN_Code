This vehicle directly influences the immediate driving behavior of the ego car, requiring it to reduce speed or stop, and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the right side of the ego car, slightly ahead, and facing away from the car. The pedestrian might be crossing or walking along the road. Due to the pedestrian's proximity and unpredictability, the ego car needs to exercise caution and be ready to stop to ensure their safety. The ego car should monitor the pedestrian's movements cautiously.\n\nOn the right edge of the road, beside the pedestrian, there are two traffic cones and a caution sign. These could indicate a hazard or reduced road width ahead, signaling the need for the ego car to slow down and possibly change lanes if it is safe to do so. The ego car should also be alert for potential hazards or a work zone.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large yellow cautionary sign beside the traffic cone. Although it is not directly on the road, it reinforces the presence of road work or a hazard. This sign indicates potential nearby hazards that could affect pedestrians or road conditions."

Monitor the pedestrian on the right for any signs of intending to cross the road and be ready to yield. Approach the traffic cone with caution, slowing down and staying alert for potential hazards or changes in road width that could require a lane change if it is safe. Given the nighttime driving conditions, reduce speed appropriately and maintain heightened awareness of the driving environment. Additionally, the presence of a traffic cone and caution sign suggests the need for reduced speed and heightened awareness for possible road work or obstacles ahead."
