This needs attention as the truckâ€™s maneuver will likely slow down or stop, requiring the ego car to possibly adjust speed or change lanes.\n   - Multiple cars are in the adjacent left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles may change lanes or impact traffic flow, demanding attention and possible adjustments from the ego car.\n   - A blue car is visible farther away in the leftmost lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Monitoring this vehicle helps anticipate any potential lane changes or impacts on traffic flow.\n   - A white car is visible in the rear view, at some distance, in an adjacent lane to the right. Keeping an eye on this vehicle is important to understand the overall traffic scenario and be ready for any lane changes from this car.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A road sign on the right side of the road indicates a right curve ahead. This sign informs drivers to prepare for the upcoming curve and to adjust their speed.\n   - A blue informational sign with arrows pointing forward and left indicates directions for lanes. This helps the ego car understand lane designations and potential maneuvers of other road users.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - There is a green traffic light ahead for the direction in which the ego car is traveling. The green light gives the right of way to proceed but suggests being prepared to stop if the light changes.\n   - Traffic lights ahead, just beyond the intersection, are displaying a red signal. The red light requires all traffic in this lane, including the ego car, to stop at the intersection.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - A road median on the left, with plants and flowers, separates the opposite directions of traffic. This barrier prevents the ego car from crossing over to the opposite side of traffic and must be considered when evaluating possible lane changes."

Remember to signal in advance and check blind spots if a lane change is chosen, while monitoring the adjacent lane for other cars. As the light is currently green and may change, be prepared to stop if it does. Most importantly, adjust the speed of the ego vehicle according to the upcoming curve as indicated by the road sign. Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck ahead, be prepared to stop due to the red traffic light at the intersection, and stay alert for any unexpected movements from vehicles in the adjacent lanes. Observing lane discipline and abiding by traffic signals are priorities to ensure safe and lawful driving behavior."
