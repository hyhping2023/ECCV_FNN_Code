Since they are close to the driving lane, there's a potential risk that they might inadvertently step into the roadway. The autonomous vehicle must be aware of this possibility and prepared to react accordingly to prevent any incident.\n\nAdditionally, there are large industrial spools and a trash bin located on the side of the road. Despite being stationary and not directly impeding the vehicle's path, these objects are suggestive of possible industrial activity nearby. There might be instances of vehicles stopping or unloading items in the vicinity. As a result, the ego vehicle should remain alert to such activities, which could affect the regular flow of traffic, and monitor these objects as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe JSON data indicates the absence of other road users like additional vehicles and no observable traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the image."
