On the left side of the scene, there is a white car parked next to a fence. Although this vehicle is stationary and does not pose a direct threat, it is important to maintain spatial awareness because the car doors might open or the vehicle might move into the traffic flow. On the right side, there is a dark-colored car partially coming into view. This vehicle is not an immediate risk, but caution is advised for any sudden movements or the possibility of pedestrians walking between parked cars.\n\nAdditionally, a metal fence is located directly in front of our vehicle and is partially illuminated by the headlights. This barrier indicates that the vehicle cannot proceed on its current path and must find an alternate route.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drivers should exercise caution and maintain a low speed due to limited visibility and the potential risk of pedestrians or other road users suddenly emerging from vehicles parked along the roadside. Barricades define the available driving space, and drivers should operate within these constraints, ensuring no action is taken that might result in contact with the barriers. If barricades indicate that the road is closed or leads to a dead end, drivers should not proceed further and should instead turn around or reverse when it is safe to do so. If there is a safe and legal way to bypass the barricades, vehicles should proceed with caution, paying special attention to stationary vehicles on both sides and any possible cross traffic.",
