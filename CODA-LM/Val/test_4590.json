However, there is a notable presence of other objects on the side of the road, specifically a pile of debris that includes bags and various other items. This debris poses a potential hazard, as parts of it may extend onto the roadway or shift onto the driving path. It's crucial for the ego car to keep an alert eye on this debris to anticipate and react accordingly should any of it move onto the road, impacting driving behavior and possibly necessitating a change in the car's trajectory or speed to avoid it."
