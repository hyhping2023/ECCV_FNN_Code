        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, various road users and objects are present, each influencing the driving behavior of the ego car in distinct ways. \n\nFirstly, there is a bus stopped on the right side of the road ahead, facing the same direction as our vehicle. The presence of the bus is critical as it may begin to move at any time or passengers might start to disembark, potentially affecting the flow of traffic and requiring adjustments in the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic sign is noticeable. It is a blue circular sign with a white arrow, placed on the right side, indicating the direction lanes must follow. This sign plays an essential role in guiding drivers to choose the correct lane and direction, thereby influencing lane selection.\n\nTraffic cones have been placed on the right side of the road as well, demarcating a section presumably set aside for construction or maintenance purposes. The positioning of these cones suggests that there may be obstacles ahead or that the right lane might be closed, advising the vehicle to progress with caution and be ready to merge to the left if necessary.\n\nA temporary fence set up on the right side of the road further indicates an area possibly under construction or off-limits to vehicles. This situation implies that the vehicle should maintain a leftward lane preference to circumvent the fenced area and any potential risks, such as obstacles or pedestrians unexpectedly entering the roadway from the enclosed area.\n\nLastly, behind the traffic cones and along the same side of the road, trash cans are arranged, highlighting the boundary of a non-passing area. While these objects are not directly expected to alter driving behavior, their unforeseen movement onto the road could necessitate swift responsive action.\n\nIn summarizing, the observed traffic scenario features a stopped bus, directional guidance through a traffic sign, implications of lane adjustments due to construction indicated by traffic cones and a temporary barrier, and the presence of non-passing markers via trash cans on the right side of the road. Each element plays a role in dictating cautious and informed driving behavior, ensuring safety and compliance with road regulations."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a moderate speed in your vehicle, be vigilant of surrounding buses and potential pedestrians, and prepare for motorcycles that may merge into your lane. Pay attention to changes in construction areas. It is advised to stay in the current lane unless there is an obstruction in the right lane ahead, then prepare to safely merge left. Continue to monitor changes in traffic lights and proceed with caution. Due to wet road conditions, appropriately reduce your speed and increase the following distance to accommodate for the potentially slippery surface.",

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It serves as a warning for drivers to avoid certain areas on the road, often due to construction work or other road obstructions. In this scenario, it indicates that the driver of the ego car should remain cautious and stay clear of the area demarcated by the cone, potentially requiring a change in the driving path to maintain safety.",
