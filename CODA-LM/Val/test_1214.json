The presence of these vehicles requires the ego car to adjust its speed and lane choice accordingly, and to be prepared to respond to any sudden braking or turn signals. Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked on the right side of the road, partly illuminated by street lights. The ego car must be vigilant for any unexpected movements such as car doors opening or pedestrians stepping out from between the parked vehicles. Another vehicle is also observed in the left lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego car, which necessitates monitoring for potential lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a parking sign, indicating a designated parking area. This sign alerts the ego car to the possibility of vehicles entering or exiting parking spots. Reflective traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the ego car's lane, signaling a delimited area that may be due to construction or a temporary road layout change. The ego car is required to steer left to avoid these cones. Furthermore, temporary road barriers are installed to the right, creating a separation between the active road and the delimited area, which effectively narrows the available road width for the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."

Continue monitoring the environment for any other road users or changes in road conditions. Pay extra attention to the parked vehicles on the right for any unexpected movements or pedestrians. Heed the traffic cones by preparing to slow down or merge if necessary, and monitor the road condition continuously for safe driving. Keep left to avoid the traffic cones and barriers to the right without drifting too close to the vehicle in the left lane. Be aware of the parking area to the right as other road users may slow down or stop to park."
