While this vehicle is not an immediate threat, there is a potential risk if it were to move unexpectedly, which would require monitoring.\n\nOn the sidewalk, also on the left side, there is a pedestrian standing beside a scooter, which is near some construction machinery. Although they are not directly on the road, their proximity to the roadway means they should be watched carefully to ensure they do not step into the path of oncoming traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a metal fence and traffic cones on the right side of the road, delineating a construction area. These barriers are important for autonomous vehicles to recognize and navigate around, as they may necessitate lane changes or speed adjustments to maintain safety.\n\nLastly, a construction crane is present on the sidewalk on the left side and is partially extending into the road. This crane could potentially cause movement or create obstructions, so it should be approached with caution.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

    "driving_suggestion": "When passing through, the vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the parked red car, monitor pedestrians near the construction site, and be prepared for any pedestrians entering the lane. Drive cautiously, maintaining a speed that allows for quick responses to unexpected obstacles. Slightly adjust the lane position to the right to stay away from the parked car while remaining within the lane. Stay alert and watch for any sudden movements from construction workers or within the construction zone. Since there are no vulnerable road users or traffic signs nearby, no immediate action is required, but the vehicle should still closely monitor the changing road environment. Due to the construction signs, the vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to adjust the lane position as needed to maintain a safe distance from traffic cones and obstacles. Stay vigilant for any sudden movements from construction equipment or within the construction area.",
