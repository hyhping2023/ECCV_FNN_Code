The parked truck occupies part of the lane and may obscure pedestrians or obstacles appearing from in front of or beside the truck.\n   - A blue and yellow taxi is parked on the right side ahead, facing the opposite direction of the autonomous vehicle. The taxi may obstruct the view ahead, and it might begin to merge into the lane, so vigilance is required to respond at any moment.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A pedestrian is standing on the left side of the road. Pedestrians approaching the roadway may suddenly cross the street; hence, it is necessary to remain vigilant and be prepared to stop at any time.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - Temporary barriers are placed in the middle of the road to separate the flow of traffic in two directions. These barriers guide the flow of traffic and prevent any vehicles from crossing over into the oncoming lane."

Watch for any sudden movements from pedestrians, and slow down if necessary to ensure safety. If you need to change lanes, make sure to keep a safe distance from parked vehicles, road workers, and pedestrians. Reduce your speed to ensure there is enough safe stopping distance and to make emergency turns if needed.",
