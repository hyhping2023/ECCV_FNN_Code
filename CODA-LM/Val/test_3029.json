The taxi's front end is facing perpendicular to our vehicle's direction of travel. This taxi needs to be carefully monitored as it may perform unexpected maneuvers, such as stopping to pick up passengers or changing lanes, which could affect our driving behavior.\n\nAdditionally, there are large round industrial spools stacked next to a fence along the roadside. While they currently do not pose a direct threat, it is important to keep an eye on them. They could potentially become an obstacle or cause changes in the environment that may impact driving, such as if they were to roll onto the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe following distance from the taxi ahead, paying attention to its brake lights and turn signals to gauge its driving intentions. Drive cautiously due to the presence of parked vehicles, while also being mindful of the resulting spatial limitations. Given the road conditions and the absence of any emergency traffic restrictions, the vehicle should maintain a prudent speed, monitor any potential hazards from industrial reels placed by the roadside, and keep a safe distance from taxis parked along the curb in case they suddenly start moving. The vehicle should adhere to standard driving procedures, adjust driving behavior according to road conditions, and remain vigilant for any changes in traffic or environmental conditions.",

This object is stationary and located outside the roadway, seemingly within an industrial or storage area. For the ego car, the presence of this object should have no immediate influence on driving behavior, as it does not pose any hazard nor does it interact with the traffic flow.
