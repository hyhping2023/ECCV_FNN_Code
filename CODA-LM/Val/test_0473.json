This vehicle is significant as it dictates the ego car's speed and following distance to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a cyclist to the right, riding adjacent to a blue fence, and traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the cyclist requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance, be ready for potential evasive actions, and keep an eye on the cyclist's movements to avoid any accidents. Alongside the road, there is a continuous blue fence on the right side, which serves as a barrier between the roadway and an adjacent construction or off-limit area. This barrier limits access to the side area and reduces the available road width, signaling that the ego car needs to be mindful of the limited space available for maneuvers. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

The ego car should continue to observe the road for any potential changes in the road users' behavior or new road users entering the scene."
