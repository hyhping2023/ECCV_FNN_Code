This suggests the ego car must maintain a safe following distance. Slightly ahead of the blue van on the left side is a white sedan, also stationary or in slow traffic, reinforcing the notion of heavy traffic or a potential stoppage, necessitating the ego car's attentiveness and readiness to stop.\n\nAhead, a cyclist is moving across the intersection, possibly crossing the ego car's path. The ego car must yield to the cyclist until they have safely crossed. Additionally, pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right. While they are not currently crossing, they may do so, requiring the ego car to remain alert for any individuals who might unexpectedly enter the road.\n\nAbove the intersection, a red traffic light is visible, instructing the ego car to stop and not proceed until the light turns green. Furthermore, roadside trees and bushes to the right limit visibility of the sidewalk and side street, which could conceal pedestrians or vehicles that may unexpectedly enter the road."
