Additionally, the ego car should stay alert for any instructions or changes in the behavior of the vehicles ahead, as well as for any possible updates from traffic management present due to the construction or detour indicated by the barrier sign and traffic cones. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The ego car should be prepared to change lanes if necessary due to the obstructed right lane by the parked truck and excavator. Adhere to the indications on the red signboard and be prepared for unexpected road conditions or directions due to potential construction work. Nighttime driving conditions require additional attention to the road surface and increased readiness to react to unforeseen obstacles."
