The condition of the van's windows being closed and the indistinguishability of the vehicle's brand logo are noted, attributable to motion blur. The presence and movement of this van are potentially indicative of it overtaking or traveling in parallel with the autonomous vehicle, a critical factor that may influence the autonomous vehicle's decision-making regarding lane changes or speed adjustments. There are no other road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, nor are there any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this image."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to limited visibility and blurred images, the primary suggestion is to maintain a safe following distance from the white van on the left and to stay alert to any possible merging or lane-changing actions of the vehicle. Given the uncertainty of road conditions, the ego car should continue to drive cautiously, reducing speed when necessary, to ensure there is adequate response time for unexpected situations. Special care must be taken especially when changing lanes to the left or turning left where the left-side view is needed. Maintain a safe distance from the van to prevent any sudden stops or unforeseen movements. Be prepared to adjust speed or direction in response to any hidden obstacles that may become visible after moving away from the van.",
