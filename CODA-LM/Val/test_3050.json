        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, a large yellow truck is present in the same lane as our autonomous vehicle. It is easily noticeable by its high chassis and the visible license plate. The truck takes up most of the lane's width. This creates a situation where the autonomous vehicle's ability to move forward in the lane is hindered, and the driver's view of the road ahead is significantly obstructed. Additionally, there's a row of bicycles parked on the right side of the autonomous vehicle, within a designated bicycle parking zone. While the parked bicycles do not interfere with the flow of traffic, their presence suggests a location of potential interactions with pedestrians or cyclists, which the autonomous vehicle should cautiously monitor."

Stay alert, pay attention to the truck's turn signals, possible turns or stops, and be mindful of other road users, especially around parked bicycles, as they may suddenly enter the road. Proceed with caution when your direct line of sight is obstructed by the truck.",

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle is a heavy machinery unit typically used for construction tasks. In this case, the construction vehicle seems to be a yellow excavator being transported on a flatbed truck. The presence of such a vehicle suggests that construction work might be occurring nearby or that the vehicle is being moved to or from a construction site. As a consequence, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance as construction vehicles can make unexpected movements, such as sudden stops or turns, and may sometimes have protruding parts that require additional clearance. Extra caution should be exercised to account for the potential of construction debris or related activities in the vicinity.",
