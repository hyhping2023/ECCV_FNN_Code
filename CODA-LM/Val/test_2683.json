The truck's large size and load suggest it might move slower than smaller vehicles, and its width takes up most of the lane, leaving little room for the ego car to pass without changing lanes.\n\nRoad work signs are present on the right side, indicating road construction ahead. These signs warn the driver of potential hazards or workers on the road, suggesting that the driver should proceed with caution and possibly at a reduced speed.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones and barriers are set up on the road, narrowing the drivable space of the lane, which likely indicates roadwork or an obstruction ahead. These cones guide traffic and require the ego car to adjust its path to avoid them, maintaining a safe distance.\n\nTemporary traffic barriers are also on the right, separating the work zone from the lanes of traffic. These barriers define the road work area and demonstrate that the right lane is obstructed, necessitating that vehicles use the left lane instead.\n\nMoreover, there are some objects like bags, debris, or tarps near the traffic cones on the right lane. These objects could potentially move into the ego car's lane due to wind or other disturbances, and they need to be monitored closely."
