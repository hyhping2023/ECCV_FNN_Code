The car's partially visible tail lights suggest that it is active, but it is unclear whether it is moving or stationary from this still image. As a result, the ego car must keep a safe following distance, remain alert to the possibility of the car ahead being stationary, and watch out for any brake lights that may indicate the car is slowing down or preparing to stop.\n\nWhile scrutinizing the area for traffic signs, none are visible within the frame that would dictate immediate driving behavior. Consequently, the ego vehicle should adhere to the general road rules and any prior knowledge of the area when making driving decisions.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, the image does not show any. The ego vehicle should, therefore, continue to be vigilant for any traffic lights that may appear in view moving forward.\n\nThere is a brightly colored traffic cone on the right side of the road, near the curb, signalling a possible road hazard or construction area. To address this, the ego car should be ready to cautiously adjust its lane position to the left if it is safe and feasible, ensuring to steer clear of the cone while remaining in the marked lane.\n\nLastly, there are no barriers or other objects in the image that would affect the driving path or behavior of the ego vehicle."

It is an unusual and unexpected obstacle within the driving path that the ego vehicle would need to navigate around to continue driving safely.
