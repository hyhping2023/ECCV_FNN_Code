Due to the significant size of the truck and how it fills the lane, it is essential for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance to avoid any safety risks.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones present which are brightly colored and have alternating yellow and red stripes. These cones create a taper leading from the left to the right lane. This setup suggests that there is a lane closure forthcoming and implies that vehicles should prepare to merge to the right lane if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, the scene includes temporary barriers that delineate an area of work from the active traffic lanes on the left side. These barriers serve a protective purpose for road workers and equipment, thus necessitating that drivers remain alert and be ready to adjust their speed or merge in response to the road signage or the conditions presented by the worksite.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects presented in the image that impact the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle."
