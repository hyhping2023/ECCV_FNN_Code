This vehicle may either start driving or remain parked, which could affect the ego vehicle's turning or merging maneuvers, and caution is advised due to its unpredictable status. A white sedan is positioned perpendicular to the ego vehicle's lane, blocking the path and potentially requiring the ego vehicle to stop or navigate around it. A silver sedan is oriented diagonally across the lanes, possibly in the process of parking or maneuvering, affecting traffic flow and indicating a potential lane change or stop. There is also a white SUV parked on the side of the road, which does not immediately affect traffic but should be watched for any sudden activity like doors opening or pedestrians appearing. Additionally, several other vehicles are in the background, including parked cars and one preparing to enter traffic, which should be monitored for unexpected movements.\n\nVulnerable road users include a cyclist crossing the street in front of the ego vehicle, necessitating the ego vehicle to yield. Pedestrians are on the sidewalk to the left, with one carrying an umbrella, and they could decide to cross, requiring the ego vehicle to stop. Traffic officers are also present in the middle of the intersection, directing traffic, and their instructions must be followed over regular traffic signals and signs.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a '30 km/h speed limit' sign and a 'No Parking' sign are visible to the left, indicating the maximum speed and parking restrictions that the ego vehicle must obey. Behind these signs, a 'No Entry' sign is also visible, indicating a road restriction that must be adhered to unless directed otherwise by a traffic officer.\n\nA traffic light is installed overhead in the distance, but its current state is not visible, meaning the ego vehicle will need to determine the right of way when the light becomes visible.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed around the intersection, suggesting caution and possibly indicating road work or a change in traffic patterns, which means the ego car should proceed carefully.\n\nLastly, a police officer in a high-visibility jacket is directing traffic in the center of the image, indicating a special traffic situation or incident being managed, and drivers should follow their instructions.\n\nNo barriers are present in the image."
