            "description and explanation": "A large construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, is seen occupying the road space directly ahead. The vehicle's size and type suggest slower acceleration and maneuverability. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance to account for the construction vehicle's possible sudden stops or changes in speed. Regardless of the future intentions of the ego car, such as maintaining the current lane or changing lanes, awareness of the sizable disparity in acceleration and braking characteristics between the ego car and the construction vehicle is crucial. Driving behavior should be adjusted accordingly to ensure safety and compliance with road regulations.",

Do not attempt to overtake the truck if the barriers on the right or any other road conditions prevent a safe maneuver. Monitor the environment for any additional signs, signals, or changes in road conditions that might further influence driving behavior. Regularly check mirrors and blind spots for other road users who may be approaching or attempting to overtake. Regularly assess the state of the green traffic light as the ego car approaches to prepare for a potential stop if the light changes. Keep headlights and taillights on for visibility and be vigilant of the surroundings due to reduced night visibility."
