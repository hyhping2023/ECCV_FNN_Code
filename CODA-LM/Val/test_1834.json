Its body is slightly angled towards the road, which may suggest that the driver is preparing to merge into traffic or leave the parking space. Due to the unclear intentions of the parked vehicle, our autonomous car should remain alert and ready to respond to the possibility of the car entering our lane.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the left, there is a group of pedestrians, including students accompanied by adults. Some individuals are close to the edge of the crossing area. The proximity to the pedestrian crosswalk means there is a risk of pedestrians stepping onto the roadway, and as such, our vehicle must proceed with caution in this area.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic officer is present on the right side of the pedestrian crossing. The officer is wearing a high-visibility vest and seems to be directing traffic and pedestrian flow. This situation may require the autonomous vehicle to be prepared to follow any hand signals or instructions given by the officer.\n\nThere is also a cyclist moving towards our vehicle in the opposite lane. Cyclists are considered vulnerable road users, and it is important for our vehicle to maintain a safe distance when overtaking or in case the cyclist decides to change lanes.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a \"No Parking\" sign is visible. This sign indicates that stopping is not permitted at that location, which is important for maintaining a smooth flow of traffic.\n\nThe JSON data does not include any traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image, indicating that these elements are not present or not relevant in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "When driving, one must proceed with caution, especially when nearing a pedestrian crossing where schoolchildren and traffic police are present. Be prepared to yield to pedestrians and follow the instructions of the traffic police (if present). Additionally, closely monitor vehicles parked on the left side of the road ahead to prevent them from entering your lane. Also, maintain a safe distance from motorcycles to accommodate sudden stops or changes in speed. Since there are no traffic light signals, rely on traffic rules and any instructions from traffic police when crossing intersections. Exercise caution when passing tricycles parked on the left, and be vigilant for any unexpected movements.",
