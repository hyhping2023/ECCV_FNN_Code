A group of workers in high-visibility clothing is dispersed across the intersection, indicating potential road construction or maintenance activity. This requires the ego car to drive cautiously and be prepared for possible detours. \n\nMultiple traffic signs and temporary barriers are present, signaling road work or a construction zone ahead. The ego car must comply with any changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures or reduced speed limits, as dictated by these signs and barriers. \n\nTraffic cones are arranged to suggest that a portion of the road ahead may be closed for construction work. The ego car should be ready to adapt to a new traffic flow pattern or a lane shift as indicated by the cones. \n\nTemporary barriers have been set up around what appears to be a construction zone, blocking off part of the road. These barriers serve as a safety measure to keep vehicles out of the construction zone, and the ego car may need to slow down or stop as necessary. \n\nLastly, machinery and materials related to road work are visible around the construction area, which could present unexpected obstacles or movement that the ego car should be aware of. There are no traffic lights in the image, so no action is required in that regard."
