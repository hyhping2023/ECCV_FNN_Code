The rear view of the truck is visible, showing the cargo area and details such as brandings and reflective markings. Since the truck is directly in front of the ego vehicle, the driver of the ego car would need to maintain a safe following distance to react effectively to the truck's actions such as braking or turning. The ego vehicle may also need to consider the truck's slower acceleration and larger blind spots when contemplating overtaking or navigating around it.",
