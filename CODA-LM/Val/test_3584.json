It presents a potential danger as it may move into or obstruct the self-driving car's lane, necessitating caution. Additionally, a white car is seen at a distance, traveling in the same direction as our vehicle, which poses no immediate threat but requires monitoring for any changes in speed or lane.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, there is a white sedan located on a road perpendicular to ours, crossing what appears to be an intersection. The sedan could interfere with our vehicle's movement, impacting the decision to either continue straight or execute a turn, based on the sedan's anticipated path.\n\nMoreover, the green traffic light in view signals that the vehicle is allowed to proceed through the intersection. Also noted are barriers on the right side of the road indicating possible construction or roadwork, which may result in narrowed lanes and require heightened attention to changing traffic patterns."

    "driving_suggestion": "Your vehicle should drive cautiously and maintain a safe distance from the red forklift, which is in an unpredictable position. Continue to observe any behavior changes in the white car ahead. Proceed according to the green traffic light signal but be aware of potential obstructions or lane changes due to obstacles. Stay vigilant and pay attention to road signs or indications of ongoing construction ahead. When the green light is on and the vehicle's direction aligns with the signal, it has the right of way, but should be careful of the white sedan at the intersection and any possible obstacles or dynamics in the closed area on the right. The vehicle should approach the intersection at a controlled speed, ready to yield to oncoming cars if necessary, and stay alert to workers or unexpected obstacles around the construction zone. Due to the presence of obstacles and the forklift indicating possible nearby construction activities, drive cautiously. Pass through the intersection when the green light is on while monitoring for any sudden movements from the forklift.",
