        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several noteworthy elements affecting vehicular movement and requiring attention for autonomous driving systems.\n\nFirstly, an orange forklift is parked on the right side of the road, facing in the direction of traffic. It's positioned with its mast raised, and is partially occupying the street and sidewalk. The presence of the forklift is significant because it may obstruct the lane or make unexpected movements. This situation poses a potential hazard and could lead to a reduction in lane width, necessitating increased caution when navigating past.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users in close proximity to the forklift. A cyclist is observed moving in the same direction as the vehicular traffic, just past the forklift. The cyclist's presence is crucial as they might change positions within the lane or be impacted by road conditions. Therefore, it is essential for the leading vehicle to maintain a safe distance, being ready to adjust speed or change lanes for a safe overtaking maneuver. Further down the road, on the right sidewalk, a pedestrian is walking in the same direction as the vehicles. Given pedestrians' unpredictability and potential to step onto the road, our vehicle should closely monitor their movements to prevent any incidents.\n\nAdditionally, there's a barrier set up along the sidewalk that extends along the road. This barrier is essential for guiding the flow of traffic and separating the sidewalk from the roadway. It signifies that autonomous vehicles need to be conscious of these obstacles as they limit the space available for any potential maneuvering.\n\nIn this scene, no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects are reported, indicating their absence or irrelevance in the current traffic scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the forklift, be prepared to stop or slow down at any time to respond to sudden movements of the forklift, and monitor the position changes of cyclists ahead. Overtaking should only be considered when there is clear and safe visibility, also taking into account potential oncoming traffic that may not be visible from the current perspective. Additionally, keep a safe distance from obstacles and monitor the movements of pedestrians. If pedestrians or any other unexpected obstacles enter the road, drive cautiously and be prepared to yield. Due to the slippery road surface, the vehicle should reduce speed and be ready to stop or safely maneuver around the forklift. It is also advisable to continuously monitor any changes in the behavior of the forklift and cyclists.",
