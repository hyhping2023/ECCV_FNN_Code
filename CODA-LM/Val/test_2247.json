The circular pedestrian crossing sign is located on the left side of the road and is illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. This sign is intended to alert drivers of potential pedestrians crossing the road, prompting them to adjust their speed and maintain focus. Additionally, there are orange and white reflective traffic cones arranged in a linear pattern on the right side of the road, indicating possible road closure or construction. These cones signal that vehicles should avoid crossing into the demarcated area due to potential hidden dangers or ongoing maintenance."
