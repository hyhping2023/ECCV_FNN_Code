The crane is equipped with an extended boom and is possibly in a working or transport state. Due to its large size and slower speed, this crane may reduce the available road space and pace for the ego vehicle, necessitating attention and potential maneuvering.\n\nFurther ahead, there are several cars in the middle and left lanes, with one white car closest in the middle lane. These vehicles influence the overall flow of traffic and potential lane-changing decisions for the ego vehicle.\n\nIn terms of barriers, there are green noise barrier walls running along both sides of the highway. While these influence noise levels, they do not directly impact driving behavior unless there are concerns about lane demarcation or visual obstruction. Additionally, a green fence runs along the road on the right-hand side, defining the edge of the roadway and restricting access, which ensures that the ego car remains within road boundaries."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a mobile crane truck which is equipped with a crane and outriggers stabilizing platform. This type of vehicle is commonly used for lifting heavy materials and assisting in construction tasks. Its presence on the road suggests ongoing or upcoming construction work in the vicinity. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle, as such vehicles often perform unexpected maneuvers or may slow down or stop unexpectedly to conduct operations. Additionally, the ego vehicle should be prepared for potential lane closures or diversions due to construction work and follow traffic signs or signals accordingly.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the presence of a mobile crane vehicle in the rightmost lane, the ego vehicle should prepare to maintain a safe following distance or consider a lane change to the left if the crane is moving more slowly than the flow of traffic. However, any lane change should be done cautiously, considering the positions and speeds of other vehicles further ahead, particularly in the middle lane. The ego vehicle should continue to monitor the crane and surrounding traffic to adapt to any sudden changes in the road environment. Since there are no visible traffic signs or lights, the ego vehicle should adhere to standard highway driving regulations, like speed limits and safe passing rules."
