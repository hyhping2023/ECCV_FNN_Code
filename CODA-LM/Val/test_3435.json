The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance due to the potential for sudden stops and to account for the truck's size, which may obscure the road ahead. Additionally, there is a white car parked on the side of the road with its trunk open and a person standing nearby. While the parked car itself is not on the road, there is a risk of the person stepping into the lane, so caution is advised. Furthermore, there is a truck moving away from the ego vehicle on the same road, which doesn't pose an immediate threat but should be observed for any unexpected behavior.\n\nOn the vulnerable road users front, there is a person by the parked white car who could pose a danger if they enter the roadway unexpectedly, requiring the ego car to remain vigilant and ready to react.\n\nGreen traffic cones are sited on the right edge of the road, which indicates a demarcation for ongoing road work, signifying possible lane narrowing or obstructions. The driver should be ready to alter the vehicle's lane position if necessary.\n\nA fencing barrier along the road signifies ongoing construction or restricted area access, providing a clear boundary and reducing the likelihood of unexpected crossings into the road from that side.\n\nLastly, there is a construction site visible on the right, complete with heavy machinery and materials. This indicates high activity and potential for random obstructions or people entering the road, which requires the ego vehicle to exercise additional caution when navigating the area."
