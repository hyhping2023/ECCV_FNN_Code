This van reduces the available lane width, potentially causing a hazard as it affects the drivable space.\n   - Several cars are parked to the left side of the road. These parked cars limit road width and visibility ahead, requiring the ego car to maneuver cautiously in case car doors open or motorists enter traffic.\n   - A white truck is parked on the right side of the road facing away from the ego car, with a red car parked adjacent to it on the sidewalk. These static objects narrow the drivable pathway and may obscure the view of the road ahead, potentially hiding other road users or obstacles.\n   - A red car is parked on the right side of the road, positioned perpendicular to the direction of travel. The presence of this parked car reduces the available width of the road for the ego vehicle to maneuver.\n   - A larger white vehicle, possibly a van or small truck, is parked facing the ego vehicle on the opposite side of the road, partially obscuring the road ahead. This vehicle may pose a risk if it suddenly moves or if it hides oncoming traffic.\n\n2. **Other Objects:**\n   - Trees are present along the roadside. These trees can obstruct street lighting and reduce visibility, necessitating greater caution.\n   - Possible patches of snow or ice on the ground on the roadside. These patches could make conditions slippery, requiring the ego car to maintain a reduced speed and increase following distance to avoid skidding or sliding.\n   - A tree is adjacent to the road on the right. While it does not directly impact driving behavior, it contributes to the complexity of the roadside environment."
