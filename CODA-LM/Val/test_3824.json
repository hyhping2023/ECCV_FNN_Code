        "description and explanation": "In the captured traffic scene, there are various elements that the autonomous vehicle must consider to navigate safely. \n\nOn the left side of the road, a white van is observed moving away from the vehicle, followed by another car maintaining the same direction, but at a farther distance. These vehicles indicate that the right side lane is clear, demanding no immediate action from the autonomous vehicle regarding these vehicles. \n\nAdditionally, there are several cars on the opposite side of the road, driving towards the autonomous vehicle, with a median strip dividing the traffic. While these cars do not directly impact the vehicle's immediate driving decisions, staying vigilant for oncoming traffic is important for safety. \n\nFurthermore, on the right side, a white van is driving in the same direction as the autonomous car, necessitating the monitoring of its distance and trajectory to ensure a safe following distance. There is also a white bus on the left side, facing the same direction as the autonomous vehicle, although it's partially hidden. Buses may merge into the lane or pedestrians may appear suddenly, thus caution is advised.\n\nOn the right side path, a pedestrian can be partially seen beyond an obstruction. The autonomous vehicle might need to prepare to slow down or stop in case the pedestrian enters the driving path. \n\nA continuous barrier lines the road on the right, signaling the need for attentiveness due to limited visibility and possible risks that might appear from the other side of the barrier. \n\nLastly, there are other objects present like a green tarp near the guardrail, suggesting there could be debris or ongoing maintenance work potentially affecting traffic. Additionally, the presence of building materials or debris behind the obstruction on the right, although not directly in the vehicle's way, indicates proximity to a construction area, which also requires heightened awareness.\n\nSummarily, the autonomous vehicle's surroundings include vehicles that are at a safe distance, potential hazards like a pedestrian and nearby construction, and obstacles like a continuous barrier that could hide other hazards, all of which the self-driving system must consider to ensure smooth and safe operation on the road."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain your lane and proceed at a safe speed, while paying attention to the road construction on the right ahead. Be prepared to slow down and yield if pedestrians step onto the road. Monitor the road conditions of the oncoming traffic lane, but primarily focus on the traffic flow in your direction of travel or any behavioral changes that may affect your route. Keep a safe distance from the white van ahead, and be cautious of vehicles or pedestrians that may be obscured by obstacles or buses. Due to the presence of construction cones, adhere to the lane markings, and reduce speed to ensure sufficient reaction time due to limited visibility ahead caused by the lengthy obstacles.",

Its presence on the road indicates that the ego car driver may need to be cautious of frequent stops or slower speeds as buses often halt to pick up and drop off passengers. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the bus to allow for sudden stops and to provide passengers with a safe space to embark and disembark.",
