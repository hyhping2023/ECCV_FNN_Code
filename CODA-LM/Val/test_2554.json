        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several key road users and signs that dictate the behavior of the autonomous vehicle:\n\nFirstly, there is a yellow trailer belonging to a road service company parked partially in the adjacent lane on the right, facing the rear of our vehicle. Since the trailer may be assisting another vehicle, it leads to a potential reduction in lane width. Consequently, this requires vehicles in our lane to either merge left or slow down to navigate around the obstacle safely.\n\nSecondly, a white truck with the \"IVECO\" logo can be seen parked to the right side of our lane. The truck is stationary, as indicated by the lack of flashing turn signals or reverse lights. This truck potentially obstructs the pathway, necessitating a lane change from our vehicle to maintain a safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, there are several vehicles moving in the left lane, positioned at a moderate distance in front of our vehicle. While they are not immediate obstacles, the dynamic nature of traffic flow means they must be continuously monitored. They particularly impact the safe lane-changing options for our vehicle due to their presence, which could be restricted by these vehicles' movements.\n\nLastly, blue road signs mounted on an elevated structure are visible. These signs provide directional information and lane guidance, which will be considered by our vehicle to make appropriate lane choices that align with the predetermined route.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in the image and thus do not affect the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle in this scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "After confirming that there are no vehicles in the left lane, prepare to merge safely. The driver should signal in advance, check the rearview mirrors and blind spots for other vehicles, and then change lanes at a safe speed to bypass the parked truck. Additionally, the driver should always be aware of any potential changes in the traffic conditions, such as pedestrians approaching the vehicle or the parked truck suddenly moving. The vehicle should also maintain a safe distance from the yellow trailer ahead, be prepared to merge left to avoid the trailer if necessary, and monitor overhead signs to ensure the correct lane positioning for upcoming navigation decisions. Meanwhile, stay alert to any changes in traffic flow or any road users emerging from the shoulder area.",

Its presence on the side of the road suggests that there might be ongoing construction or maintenance work in the vicinity. The future driving behavior of the ego car should involve increased alertness and readiness to respond to potential obstructions, changes in traffic patterns, or instructions from construction personnel. The driver should also be prepared for possible lane closures or detours and should slow down to ensure safety near the work zone.",
