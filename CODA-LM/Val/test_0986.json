This vehicle is significant for the ego car's driving behavior, as it necessitates a reduction in speed or a complete stop by the ego car to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are yellow reflective traffic cones positioned on the right side of the road. These cones are likely indicating lane boundaries or signaling the presence of road work ahead. They serve to guide the ego car and ensure it does not veer into potentially hazardous or restricted areas.\n\nFurthermore, a continuous red and white striped barrier is present on the right side of the lane. This barrier signifies that the lane is closed or restricted, which may compel the ego car to alter its lane position towards the left to stay within the correct flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
