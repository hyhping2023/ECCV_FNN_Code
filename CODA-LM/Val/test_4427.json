These cones indicate that the ego car should merge or shift to the right, possibly due to a part of the lane ahead being closed or the presence of road works.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there is a continuous white concrete barrier that ensures the ego car will not encounter any oncoming traffic and helps maintain a clear distinction between the directions of traffic. Similarly, on the right, a high concrete median barrier is present, confirming the separation of opposite lanes of traffic and restricting the ego car from any lateral movement into oncoming lanes.\n\nThere are no reported vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects affecting the driving behavior in the image."

It is often used to mark areas of the road that are under construction, potentially hazardous, or where traffic needs to be directed away from a certain point. In this driving scenario, the cone signals the driver of the ego car to remain in the current traffic lane and not to drive or swerve into the area blocked off by the cones. This may indicate road works ahead or an obstruction on the roadside that requires drivers to steer clear for safety.",

It is often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when part of the road is closed for utility work or an accident. Upon seeing the traffic cone, drivers should become alert to potential hazards or changes in driving patterns ahead and be prepared to adjust their driving path as necessary, often by reducing speed and moving away from the cone to avoid the section of road it is marking.",

Do not attempt to overtake due to the presence of traffic cones and the concrete barrier on the left side."
