The large size and position of the truck necessitate that the autonomous driving system of the ego car maintains a safe distance and stays alert for any potential stops or turns the truck might take.\n\nAdditionally, there is an overhead traffic sign which is blue and square with a direction arrow showing a right turn. This sign also provides information about an upcoming road exit. The sign's guidance may affect the driving plan of the ego car, possibly requiring a lane change if the direction indicated by the sign aligns with the car's intended route.\n\nAlong the right edge of the road, there are orange traffic cones set up, beginning near the ego car and stretching into the distance. These cones are demarcating the sidelines and are indicative of road work or a lane closure, prompting the ego car to avoid the affected area and to proceed with heightened caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in this image that have an impact on the driving behavior of the ego car."

Prepare to change lanes if necessary for navigating around the truck or following road exit signs if the indicated direction is part of the intended route. Reduce speed slightly and stay alert as the cones may indicate workers on or near the road. The ego car should also monitor any signals from the truck in case it is preparing to turn into the parking area indicated by the sign. If planning to overtake, check for signs of road work ahead due to the presence of traffic cones and ensure the adjacent lane is clear before maneuvering."
