This vehicle's actions directly influence the required safe following distance.\n   - In front of the white sedan, a silver SUV is also in the middle of the lane, affecting the white sedan's movements and, by extension, our vehicle’s behavior.\n   - Several cars, including taxis, are in the opposite lane approaching our vehicle. These vehicles indicate the flow of traffic and potential oncoming traffic when changing lanes.\n   - A white car on the left side has just passed an orange cone, traveling in the opposite direction, requiring monitoring to maintain a safe distance.\n   - A silver SUV and a white van are also on the opposite lanes, moving away from our vehicle, indicating two-way traffic.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Pedestrians are walking on the right side of the road, parallel to our vehicle’s direction. This proximity requires heightened alertness to avoid veering onto the roadway accidentally.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road indicates an upcoming crossing area, requiring readiness to yield to pedestrians.\n   - A No Parking sign precedes the pedestrian crossing sign, indicating a parking restriction in that area.\n   - A temporary no parking sign next to our vehicle further advises against parking due to possible ongoing road work or temporary traffic conditions.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Multiple orange traffic cones along the center of the road create a guided path for traffic, instructing vehicles to navigate within the designated lanes.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n   - On the left side of the road, green fences extend into the distance, marking an area where vehicle traffic is prohibited, likely due to construction or maintenance.\n   - A green temporary fence on the left side also suggests restricted access to certain parts of the road or sidewalk, affecting pedestrian movement and available space for cars.\n\n6. **Other Objects**:\n   - A no parking sign close to a series of traffic cones on the right side of the road reiterates a temporary parking restriction, compelling private vehicles to keep moving instead of parking.\n\nThis summary captures all detectable entities from the image, including their descriptions and implications for the autonomous car’s navigation and safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white sedan ahead, prepare to slow down or stop for pedestrians, and follow the temporary road guidance indicated by traffic cones. At the same time, the vehicle should watch for pedestrians' movements on the roadside and, due to the no parking signs, must not stop arbitrarily in the current section of the road. The vehicle should slow down and be ready to stop for pedestrians. When bypassing the parked white sedan, caution is needed, and if necessary, it is safe to change lanes while also paying attention to the reduced lane width caused by traffic cones. It is also important to monitor the opposite lane for safe lane-changing opportunities. Staying alert and watching for pedestrians who may cross the road at pedestrian crosswalk signs is crucial. Therefore, the vehicle should drive carefully, prioritize pedestrian safety, and carefully change lanes to bypass obstacles when necessary. Due to the presence of pedestrians and the road narrowing because of traffic cones, the vehicle should slow down, drive carefully, and pay close attention to pedestrians who might enter the lane. Compliance with the temporary no parking signs, avoiding parking in this area, is required. Keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, ready to deal with possible obstacles or changes in traffic flow caused by the lane narrowing.",
