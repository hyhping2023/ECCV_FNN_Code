        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are several elements affecting the driving conditions:\n\nThere is a blue bus on the left side moving in the same direction as our vehicle, while partially blocking the lane, which could hinder the traffic flow especially if it's stopping for passengers. Additionally, a white SUV is ahead on the same road, also traveling in the same direction with a safe distance maintained, which influences the speed and following distance of our vehicle. The road to the right is crowded with several cars lined up, indicating heavy traffic or a jam, and this requires our vehicle to adjust speed and be prepared to stop urgently. There's also a white car parked on the right shoulder close to the driving lane, posing a hazard as it may open doors unexpectedly or pull out, suggesting that drivers should proceed with caution.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene include a motorcyclist in the bus lane ahead to the left, who might change lanes or could be challenging to spot, presenting a potential risk. A pedestrian is also about to step onto the street from the right, in front of a parked car, prompting the need for our vehicle to be ready to slow down or stop to yield.\n\nThe traffic signs present indicate a bus station to the right, alerting drivers that the bus seen could likely stop, hence they should stay vigilant and be prepared to decelerate or halt. In this scene, there are no traffic lights.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are positioned on the right, marking an area that might be under construction or restricted, signaling the possibility of lane narrowing or obstacles ahead. Drivers must slow down and stay alert when approaching this area.\n\nLastly, elements such as sunlight reflections and potential grime on the windshield can impair visibility, affecting the driverâ€™s ability to react promptly and assess danger on the road.\n\nThus, the driving behavior must be adjusted considering these varying factors to ensure safety and smooth traffic flow."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a steady speed and keep a safe following distance from the white SUV ahead, while also being aware of city buses that may stop at stations marked with a bus sign on the left. The traffic cones on the right indicate that a specific area should be avoided, therefore the vehicle should stay to the left side of the lane to ensure safe passage. It seems that there is no immediate need to change lanes or overtake. The driver should continue to observe the surrounding environment to be prepared for any sudden occurrences, such as pedestrians or vehicles entering the road, or changes in traffic signals. Additionally, if necessary, measures should be taken to increase visibility, such as using windshield wipers or a defogging function.",
