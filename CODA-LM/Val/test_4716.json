Firstly, a vehicle is visible, identifiable by its rear end positioned on the left side, seemingly parked or stationary, paralleled to the sidewalk. It does not directly affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle at the moment, assuming it remains stationary. However, there's an advisory for caution, considering the possibility of it resuming movement unexpectedly.\n\nSecondly, an animal, which might be a dog, is seen in the center of the road, possibly illuminated by headlights or street lights. This presents an immediate hazard due to the unpredictable nature of animals. The potential for sudden movement in any direction necessitates a cautious approach from the ego vehicle, possibly requiring a complete stop to ensure safety."

Headlights should be utilized effectively to increase visibility, and if they are not already, high beams could be turned on if no other vehicles are present to improve the visible range on the dark road."
