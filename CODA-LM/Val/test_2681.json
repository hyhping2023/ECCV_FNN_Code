This car remains stationary, but our vehicle should travel in the lane farthest from it to avoid any potential risks such as sudden door openings or abrupt movements.\n\nNext, on the right side of the image, one person is partially obscured by an obstacle and is near our lane. Since pedestrians may enter the roadway, our vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, a metal barrier extends from the right, separating a construction site from the road and extends in the direction of our vehicle. This barrier suggests the presence of a construction site or road division, which may reduce the drivable road width or impose other restrictions on the vehicle's path.\n\nLastly, there is a large green waterproof tarp on the ground near our vehicle's path, next to another obstacle. Although this tarp is not an immediate danger, it could become one if not properly secured. The autonomous vehicle should monitor this object as it passes by."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please exercise caution when passing parked vehicles and maintain a safe distance from the roadside. Be prepared to stop or slow down for pedestrians close to obstacles. Watch for any movement in the green coverings; this may indicate that it will enter the roadway. Stay alert for any unexpected obstacles or pedestrians that may enter the road from a worksite or from beyond parked vehicles. Due to the presence of barriers and traffic cones indicating possible lane closures, your vehicle should slow down and be prepared to merge left or stay in the left lane. Maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead, and stay vigilant for any construction workers or machinery that might enter the roadway. Pay attention to partially obscured road construction signs; they may require extra caution or adherence to reduced speed limits. Drive carefully, keep a safe distance from white cars, and remain alert for any potential hazards that may arise in the construction area. Monitor parked vehicles for any indication that they might move into your lane, and be prepared to adjust your speed or lane position accordingly. Continue observing the road ahead and respond as necessary to any traffic signals or signs that may occur.",

In this scenario, the pedestrian appears to be close to the curbside, potentially preparing to cross or walk along the street. As a traffic policeman, you should monitor the pedestrian's actions to ensure they safely follow traffic rules and signal to drivers when necessary to be aware of the pedestrian's presence, especially if they intend to cross. The ego car should reduce speed if necessary and be prepared to stop to let the pedestrian cross.",
