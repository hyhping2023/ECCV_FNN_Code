        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, several road users and objects are observed, each affecting the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles in different ways.\n\nStarting with vehicles, three are notable in the scene. Firstly, a white van is on the right side, either entering or leaving a parking space, acting as a direct obstacle to autonomous vehicles, which might necessitate stopping or maneuvering to maintain safety. Secondly, a white sedan is parked on the left side of the road. Despite being stationary, its presence indicates the area might be used for parking, suggesting vigilance for other vehicles potentially moving in or out of spaces. Lastly, there's a white SUV parked close to the curb on the right side, which, while already parked and not obstructing the main traffic flow, should be registered by the autonomous vehicle but doesn't pose an immediate concern.\n\nThe image lacks vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, and traffic lights, indicating no immediate influence from these categories on the driving conditions in the displayed scene.\n\nA traffic sign is visible â€“ a circular yellow sign with black lettering on a pole on the left side of the road. It likely indicates a designated area for taxis, suggesting that autonomous vehicles should be prepared for taxis that might stop or decelerate unexpectedly in that area.\n\nThere are also various stationary objects by the roadside, such as trees, which, while not directly impacting driving conditions, should be continuously monitored by autonomous driving systems to ensure comprehensive environmental awareness.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a scenario with parked and potentially moving vehicles, a traffic sign indicating a taxi-related area, and static objects that collectively require detailed consideration by autonomous driving systems to navigate safely and efficiently."

    "driving_suggestion": "Autonomous vehicles should monitor white vans for any sudden lane changes, slow down to prepare for a possible stop, and adjust the speed accordingly. Although not currently visible in this scene, it is still advisable to remain vigilant for other potential road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists. At the same time, attention should also be paid to any sudden movements from parked vehicles. Continue driving along the permitted route, maintaining a safe distance from vehicles that may need to brake or turn to avoid an obstacle. Additionally, be aware of obstacles on the right side, and stay alert for vehicles that may enter the main road. If necessary, slow down to allow for safe merging.",

This sign informs drivers that the area is designated for taxis to pick up or drop off passengers. The presence of this sign would require the ego car to be aware of potential taxis slowing down or stopping to maneuver into the taxi stand, possibly causing interruptions in traffic flow. The ego car should prepare to slow down if necessary and be mindful of taxis entering or exiting the stand.",
