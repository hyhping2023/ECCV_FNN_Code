There is less immediate risk since this pedestrian's trajectory is away from the road, but monitoring them in case of unexpected movement towards the roadway is still important.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small dog on a leash near the pedestrian with the red scarf.

Proceed with caution while monitoring the pedestrians and the dog to the right. Stay within the speed limit and be prepared to stop if any pedestrian steps onto the road or if the dog gets loose. Keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the right side to allow for a safe reaction time should any doors open or if someone steps out from between the vehicles. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe speed that allows for adequate reaction time in the event of a pedestrian or pet unexpectedly entering the roadway. Ensure a safe lateral distance is kept from the parked vehicles on the right side. Stay vigilant for any changes in the environment that may require a change in driving behavior, such as the movement of the pedestrians or other road users possibly opening car doors or pulling out from their parked positions."
