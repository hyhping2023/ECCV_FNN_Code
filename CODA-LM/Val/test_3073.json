The presence of pedestrians close to the road increases the risk of them stepping onto the roadway unexpectedly, which means the ego car must be vigilant and prepared to brake suddenly.\n\nSurrounding the yellow vehicle, traffic cones have been placed, signaling a temporary stationary object in the roadway. These cones indicate a temporary alteration in traffic flow, suggesting that the ego car should proceed with caution and might need to navigate around the obstruction, potentially at a reduced speed.\n\nLastly, there is a cardboard box on the ground near the opened rear doors of the yellow vehicle.

It should also be ready to stop or navigate around the box if it enters the driving lane. Increased vigilance and preparedness to react to pedestrians' actions are required. The ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to change lanes to the left if it is safe to do so. It should monitor the positions of the pedestrians and the traffic cones to pass the parked van without hindrance. Continuous observation of the surroundings and readiness to react to the actions of other road users, especially around the delivery activity, are crucial. If a lane change is not possible due to traffic, proceed with caution, allowing for increased stopping distance in case pedestrians move into the road. The ego car should reduce speed when approaching the van and the traffic cones to ensure ample reaction time for any unexpected pedestrian movement or vehicles circumventing the parked van. Additionally, the driver should be ready to stop or maneuver gently if necessary, while also checking mirrors and blind spots when passing the parked van. Furthermore, keeping a safe distance from the moving cars on both sides of the road is crucial to accommodate for sudden stops or lane changes."
