        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects of interest. A yellow and blue taxi is positioned ahead on the left side of the road, facing the opposite direction to our vehicle. The taxi's presence is crucial for the autonomous vehicle's decision-making, as any movement by the taxi could influence the driving maneuvers required. Additionally, there is a glimpse of another yellow and blue taxi on the far right, which may be parked or stationary. This taxi also requires monitoring in case it decides to move.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pedestrian walking a dog, crossing from the left to the right side of the road, directly in the path of the autonomous vehicle. This situation demands immediate attention and action from the vehicle to ensure the safety of both the pedestrian and the dog. A cyclist is also present, observed on the right side of the road, currently stopped by the roadside. While the cyclist is not an immediate threat to the vehicle's path, there is a potential risk if they were to enter the road unexpectedly or ride erratically.\n\nThe image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would affect the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop to ensure the safety of pedestrians and dogs crossing. When overtaking cyclists, maintain a safe distance and be aware of changes in their trajectory. It is recommended to carefully observe the yellow and blue taxis on the right, in case they merge into traffic. Slow down or come to a complete stop to allow pedestrians with dogs to cross safely. Pay attention to the opposing yellow and blue taxis for any changes in behavior or direction. Additionally, watch to see if the cyclists remain within the bike lane to avoid them entering your driving path. Once the pedestrians have crossed and there is no immediate danger, proceed with caution. For cyclists, the vehicle should stay alert and be prepared to adjust speed or route to avoid potential accidents. Although the oncoming taxi does not currently pose a direct threat, the vehicle should still monitor for any sudden changes in behavior.",
