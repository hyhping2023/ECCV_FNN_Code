        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are a few key elements to note regarding the road users and their influence on driving behavior. First, there is a white van positioned in the left lane, leading our vehicle. It is imperative for vehicles behind to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to adjust their speed or change lanes depending on the van's actions to ensure safety. Additionally, several cars are parked along the right side of the road. These parked cars not only narrow the available roadway but may also block the view of pedestrians or other vehicles as they attempt to merge or cross the street, necessitating heightened awareness from passing drivers. Moving forward in the right lane, multiple cars are observed driving ahead. The presence of these vehicles requires constant vigilance as they may abruptly slow down, switch lanes, or halt, potentially disrupting the flow of traffic. This situation calls for the trailing car to keep a safe following distance to react appropriately to any sudden changes.\n\nFurthermore, the road scene includes several bright red traffic cones placed strategically in the middle of the road, creating a division between lanes. These cones serve as a critical visual cue, directing vehicles to stay within the designated lanes and follow the set traffic flow. This setup underscores the importance of adhering to temporary road layouts to prevent accidents and ensure smooth traffic movement.\n\nIn this specific traffic scene, there were no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects identified that would impact the driving conditions or behavior of the autonomous car."

    "driving_suggestion": "The vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the white van ahead while continuing to drive in the same lane. Avoid the parking area on the right and be aware of vehicles that may pull out from parking spots. Additionally, the vehicle should stay within the lane lines, abide by the lane divisions marked by red traffic cones, and continuously monitor any changes in traffic conditions. Pay attention to any movements of parked vehicles or motorcycles on the right. Follow the usual flow of traffic and respect no-parking signs. Keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and when necessary, adjust lane position slightly due to the traffic cones on the left. Maintain a steady speed, follow the traffic ahead, keep a safe distance, and be prepared to respond to the movements of vehicles ahead. Stay alert for pedestrians who may cross in front of parked vehicles or vehicles that may exit parking areas. Observe no-parking signs and continue to stay in the correct lane as directed by traffic cones. Regularly check the rearview mirrors to always be aware of the traffic situation around and behind your vehicle.",

As a moving object with the potential to change speed or direction, it should be monitored carefully. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the moped decelerates, turns, or changes lanes. Observing the moped's indicators and behavior is critical for predicting its movements and reacting accordingly.",
