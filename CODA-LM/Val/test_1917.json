Ahead, on the left lane and slightly in front of the ego car, there is a car with visible rear lights, indicating it is braking or preparing to stop, possibly in response to the traffic ahead or a traffic signal. Additionally, numerous vehicles are seen on the opposite side of the median, traveling in the opposite direction, which must be watched for any unexpected maneuvers into the ego car's path. Lastly, there's a dark-colored sedan on the opposite side of the road with its headlights on, moving away; this vehicle has no immediate effect on the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nTraffic Signs: There is a speed limit sign showing 60 kilometers per hour on the right, mandating the ego car's compliance with this speed restriction. A no parking sign alongside another speed limit sign is also observed in the same area, specifying road rules which the ego car must not violate, assuming adherence to the speed limit and no intention to park.\n\nTraffic Lights: There are several traffic lights visible with red signals, requiring the ego car to stop before the intersection and wait for the change to a green light to continue.\n\nBarriers: Yellow and black median barriers separate the opposite lanes of traffic, defining the lane paths and requiring vehicles to remain within their lanes. Another barrier with yellow and black stripes on the right side protects a median or pedestrian area, making it clear that this space is not meant for vehicles, aiding the ego car in recognizing the road's usable boundaries.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this traffic image."

There are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or other objects that would require immediate attention, but the driver should remain vigilant for any changes in the traffic environment. The ego car should begin to decelerate smoothly to prepare to stop due to the visible braking car ahead in the same lane and the red traffic lights indicating that traffic is required to halt at the intersection. It is important to remain vigilant for vehicles on the opposite side of the road, maintain the speed limit of 60 km/h until needing to stop, and stay in the correct lane as dictated by the median barriers. The ego car should come to a stop at the intersection due to the red traffic lights directly ahead and wait for them to turn green before proceeding. It should also monitor the traffic lights' change to prepare for a safe acceleration. Maintaining the speed limit as indicated by the speed sign is necessary once the car proceeds. The presence of barriers indicates that the ego car should stay in its current lane and there are no immediate obstructions requiring avoidance."
