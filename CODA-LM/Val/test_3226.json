        "description and explanation": "The image displays several elements that are pertinent to autonomous driving and road safety. Firstly, noticeable are several vehicles traveling on a parallel road to the left, moving in the opposite direction to our vehicle. Although these vehicles are separated by obstacles and will not directly influence the immediate driving decisions of our car, their presence is crucial for maintaining situational awareness.\n\nFurthermore, a median strip is present on the left side, acting as a barrier between our lane and the adjacent one. This barrier plays a dual role; it prevents vehicles in the adjacent lane from accidentally entering our lane, enhancing safety. However, it also constrains our vehicle's ability to change lanes swiftly in case of an emergency, which requires careful consideration in the driving strategy.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the driveway, there's a detection of a large white object, resembling a bag. This object poses a potential risk as it may enter the roadway, becoming a traffic obstruction. The autonomous driving system of our vehicle must stay alert and be ready to execute evasive maneuvers if the object becomes a direct threat to safe passage.\n\nThese observations encompass a variety of road users and objects, each contributing differently to the driving environment. By understanding these elements, an autonomous vehicle can make well-informed decisions to navigate safely and efficiently."

It has the potential to be moved by wind or passing vehicles. The presence of this item on the road necessitates cautious driving from the ego car to avoid any unexpected situations if the bag were to be lifted onto the roadway. The driver should be alert and prepared to safely navigate around the item without making sudden or dangerous maneuvers that could compromise road safety or cause distraction to other road users.",
