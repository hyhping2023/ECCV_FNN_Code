It shows visible signs of wear and might drop debris since such vehicles often move at a slower pace, potentially disrupting the flow of traffic and posing a hazard to other road users.\n\nAbove the road, there are directional signs that provide information on lane directions as well as indicating upcoming exits or routes. These signs assist drivers in making navigation and lane choice decisions in a timely manner.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a prominent pole to the right in the foreground. While it is positioned close to the driving lane, it does not impact or obstruct the traffic flow, allowing vehicles to pass by without any required alteration to their driving behavior.\n\nThis scene does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers according to the provided data."
