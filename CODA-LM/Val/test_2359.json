This parked car reduces the drivable width of the road and could potentially open doors or pull out into traffic, requiring caution and possibly a lane change from the ego car. Further ahead on the left side of the street, several cars are parked facing the ego car. These parked vehicles should be monitored in case one starts to move or a door opens, which could affect the traffic flow. Directly in front of the ego car, there is a dark sedan partially on the road, obstructing the lane and possibly maneuvering to park or depart, thus demanding the ego car's attention. Additionally, several cars are parked in a line along the curb on the right, ahead of the black car, indicating a busy roadside with a higher likelihood of pedestrians, doors opening, or cars pulling out.\n\nThere are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the image, allowing the focus to remain on vehicular traffic and fixed obstacles. The quality and angle of the image do not allow for the determination of the presence of traffic signs, which means normal road rules apply unless a sign is observed later. No traffic lights are discernible in the current field of view, so the ego car should proceed under the assumption that there are no immediate traffic signals affecting its movement. The absence of traffic cones suggests there is no nearby construction or lane closures to consider. Lastly, no barriers are observable in the image, allowing for normal lane navigation without the need to consider barrier-related restrictions. There are no other objects mentioned in the data."

Be prepared to adjust the ego car's path to ensure safe passage around the parked vehicles, allowing for unexpected movements by them or doors opening. Regularly check mirrors for any indications of those vehicles becoming active in the traffic scene. Due to the parked vehicles on the right, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the parked cars to avoid any sudden obstructions. Since the parked car is partially occluding the lane, the ego car should be prepared to change lanes if necessary, after checking for traffic in the adjacent lane. Since visibility is partially reduced due to glare, the ego car should also proceed with caution with respect to speed and remain vigilant for any unforeseen hazards that may become visible as it gets closer. Always be ready to adapt to dynamic situations such as pedestrians that may appear suddenly from between parked cars or vehicles that may initiate pulling out."
