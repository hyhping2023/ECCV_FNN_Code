To the left, there are several parked cars which, although not in the direct path of the ego car, demand caution from the ego vehicle to anticipate any sudden movements such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging unexpectedly from between the parked vehicles.\n\nIn the middle of the road, pedestrians are observed crossing, with what appears to be a child following an adult, and a dog accompanying them. These pedestrians are in the ego vehicle's path, necessitating that the car yield to allow them to cross safely.\n\nAlong the right side of the road, yellow and black striped traffic cones are noticeable. These cones are placed to separate the bicycle lane from the driving lane, dictating the path the ego vehicle should take and marking an area that the car should not enter.\n\nAdditionally, parked bicycles are situated on the right-hand side of the road. Though they do not block the ego vehicle's path directly, they could influence the usable width of the road for the vehicle, as well as possibly affect pedestrian movements.\n\nLastly, there is a temporary structure or obstruction on the right, resulting in a reduction of the available driving space. This obstruction mandates that the driver of the ego car navigate carefully and remain vigilant to avoid any potential collision, particularly in the presence of pedestrians. Traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers are not mentioned within the data, which indicates that there are none in the scene that would have an impact on the ego vehicle's driving behavior."

It should also slightly adjust its trajectory away from the road obstruction on the right, ensuring not to infringe on the pedestrian's space, and pass with caution."
