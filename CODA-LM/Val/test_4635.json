There is a white car positioned ahead on the right side of the road, which is partially obscured by street furniture, suggesting that it is parked. Although this car is not an immediate obstacle for the ego vehicle, attention should be paid to the surrounding area. Pedestrians could potentially move around the parked car, or the car may start to move into traffic.\n\n2. Further ahead, there are several vehicles with their tail lights on, indicating they are moving away from the position of the ego vehicle. The autonomous driving system should keep an eye on these vehicles to maintain a safe distance. It's important to monitor their speed and trajectory to anticipate any stops or turns that could affect the navigation of the ego vehicle.\n\nOther Objects:\n\nA line of mopeds is parked on the right-hand side of the road by the sidewalk. While these parked mopeds do not pose an immediate danger, it is important to watch for any individuals who may approach the mopeds with the intention of moving them or potentially stepping out onto the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the observed image, so these categories do not require consideration in this instance."

It is a two-wheeled motor vehicle with pedals that can be used to propel it, creating a combination of bicycle and motorcycle.
