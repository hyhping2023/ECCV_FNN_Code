    "driving_suggestion": "Due to slippery roads and low visibility, please drive cautiously, reduce your speed to accommodate the increased braking distance. Leave more space for parked trucks, and avoid areas near the roadside where the grip might be lower. Be aware of potential hazards, such as manhole covers, and circumvent them safely. Because of the low visibility and the difficulty in seeing nearby traffic signs or lights, use appropriate lighting to ensure your vehicle is visible to others. Vehicle lights and sensors should be fully utilized to enhance visibility and detect potential hazards that are hard to see due to nighttime conditions.",

It is positioned on the side of the road and does not seem to be moving, possibly parked or stationary for unloading purposes. For the ego car, the presence of this truck necessitates caution, especially if any part of the truck or related activities encroach upon the road. It must be prepared to slow down or stop to ensure safety and possibly navigate around the truck if a portion of it occupies a part of the lane intended for the ego car.",
