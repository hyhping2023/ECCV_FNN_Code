        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, several road users and signs are present, each affecting the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle, referred to as the ego car. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a white truck ahead in the left lane, sharing the same direction as the ego car. It is essential to continuously evaluate the relative speed and distance to this truck, to either maintain a proper following distance or to prepare for a lane change if overtaking is desired. Additionally, a stationary black van is parked on the right side, its rear hatch open and partially blocking the right lane. This may lead other vehicles to merge into the ego carâ€™s lane to avoid the van and also poses a risk of someone unexpectedly stepping out from behind it. Further on the right, multiple cars are parked, signaling a parking zone, and necessitating heightened vigilance for the possibility of doors opening or pedestrians emerging between vehicles.\n\nConcerning vulnerable road users, pedestrians are present on the right-side sidewalk, moving parallel to the road. Though not immediately on the roadway, their movements must be observed carefully by the ego car in case they decide to enter the road.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a blue parking sign denotes available parking with certain restrictions, indicating the area is used for parking, which could mean parking maneuvers nearby that may affect traffic flow. There is also a distant traffic sign whose details are not yet clear. As the ego car approaches, it will need to identify the information on this sign and act accordingly.\n\nLastly, there is a green traffic light at an upcoming intersection, giving the ego car the indication to proceed. Nevertheless, the ego car should maintain caution and be ready to stop if the light changes to yellow or red.\n\nNo traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the image, suggesting that these categories do not contain any road users or items of relevance in this scenario."
