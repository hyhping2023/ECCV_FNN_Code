This pedestrian is close to the roadway without a sidewalk barrier, posing a risk that necessitates cautious driving.\n\nA green traffic light is visible ahead, signaling the ego vehicle to proceed, but with caution due to the surrounding construction vehicle and pedestrian.\n\nAccumulated snow is observed on the sidewalk and along the side of the road, potentially obscuring road edges and hindering visibility, requiring the ego vehicle to stay vigilant for potential hazards."

This vehicle is usually equipped with special machinery for construction and may indicate ongoing or upcoming roadwork in the area. Given its size and the nature of work typically associated with such vehicles, it might obstruct part of the road. Caution should be exercised when driving past, maintaining a safe distance and reducing speed if necessary, according to the road conditions and any nearby traffic signs or signals.

Monitor the pedestrian for any signs of intending to cross the road and be prepared to yield. Due to parked vehicles and potentially reduced road width, reduce speed to safely navigate through the narrowed space. Pay attention to the road conditions and adjust speed accordingly to maintain control on the potentially slippery surface. Additionally, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian and be vigilant for any unexpected movements. Considering the construction vehicle obstructing the right lane, the parked cars on the left, and the blue truck ahead, the ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to switch to the left lane if it is safe to do so."
