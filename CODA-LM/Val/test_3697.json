However, there are multiple traffic cones arranged on both sides of the road, extending from the roadside towards the center. These cones are likely marking an area that needs to be avoided due to road construction, obstacles, or other hazardous areas, necessitating vehicles to navigate around them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large temporary barrier on the right side of the road, which is partially extending into the lane. This barrier may be associated with a work area or activity by the roadside, requiring the vehicle to adjust its lateral position to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle.\n\nFurthermore, beyond the fence to the right of the road, there is a structure that resembles a large tent. This could indicate that there is a roadside event or construction work taking place. While this structure does not directly encroach upon the road, its proximity to the barrier and the potential nearby activity could affect road conditions or lead to other road users slowing down or stopping.\n\nThere are no traffic signs or traffic lights indicated in the image.
