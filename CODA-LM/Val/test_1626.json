This situation indicates that these vehicles are stationary and lined up along the side of the road. As a result, the right side of the road is not available for driving. This condition necessitates that our vehicle may need to adjust its position to stay further to the left side of the lane to navigate safely through the area. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this image that affect driving behavior."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, especially because pedestrians may be walking near parked vehicles where visibility is limited. Reduce speed to respond to potential dangers posed by pedestrians or other hazards that may emerge in dim light. Stay alert to notice other road users or obstacles that may not be immediately visible. Slow down to react to any suddenly appearing obstacles or road users. For safety, increase the distance from bicycles and be prepared to stop or change lanes if the bicycle changes direction. Be cautious when overtaking bicycles, ensuring there is sufficient lateral space between you and the bicycle. It is recommended to regularly scan the road and surroundings ahead to anticipate any new situations in time. Drive carefully, particularly because of vulnerable road users by the roadside. Slow down and be ready to stop in case a pedestrian with a bicycle starts to cross the road or moves suddenly into the lane. Use low beam headlights to ensure visibility without blinding oncoming drivers or pedestrians, and stay alert to other potential hazards that may be difficult to see in dim light.",
