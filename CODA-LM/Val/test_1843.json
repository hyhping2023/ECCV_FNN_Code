The ego car will need to monitor this vehicle's speed and maintain an adequate following distance.\n\nApproaching from the opposite direction is a white car. Although no immediate action is required, the ego car should monitor this oncoming traffic for any unexpected behavior.\n\nOn the far left, ahead of the ego car and traveling in the same direction, is a motorcyclist. Due to the motorcyclist's smaller size and vulnerability, the ego car should keep a safe distance and be prepared for any sudden movements.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is centrally positioned in the left lane ahead of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. The cyclist presents a potential hazard due to their lower speed and the need for the ego car to pass them safely while maintaining a safe distance."

As part of future driving behavior, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle due to its large blind spots and the potential for sudden stops or turns. The driver should be alert for any indications that the construction vehicle may be entering or exiting a construction site, which may necessitate yielding or changing lanes to accommodate its movements.",

It should also be ready to adjust speed and position if the construction vehicle makes any indication of merging or changing lanes. The ego car must attentively monitor the oncoming traffic for further situational awareness. Maintain a prudent speed that allows for unexpected events and ensures safe maneuverability. Maintain safe following distance from the construction vehicle and the blue car ahead. Be prepared to change lanes if the construction vehicle slows down traffic flow or if overtaking is safe and legal. Continuously monitor the motorcyclist's position and give them enough space. Drive at a speed that is appropriate for the conditions and observe road signs for any additional instructions or restrictions."
