Additionally, a white van is noticed in the opposing lane, going in the opposite direction, indicating that caution is needed for any lane changes. Further ahead, several cars are distributed across the lanes going in the same direction as the ego car, influencing the traffic flow and potentially the speed of the ego vehicle. There is also a white van located slightly ahead of the ego vehicle on the left and in a parallel lane; this van might change lanes or adjust speed, necessitating vigilance. Lastly, multiple cars are visible in the opposite lane facing oncoming traffic. Although they do not immediately affect the ego vehicle's path, they should be monitored.\n\nAlso noted are static objects such as trees, buildings, and utility poles on the sides of the road. While these objects are passive in nature and do not impact driving behavior directly, they still need to be monitored by the autonomous system.\n\nThe JSON data does not indicate the presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the current traffic image."

These vehicles can carry large quantities of material such as soil, rock, or construction debris. Due to this vehicle's size and operating characteristics, drivers must be cautious when maneuvering near it and should maintain a safe following distance. Sudden stops or slow movements are common with such vehicles, so the ego car must be prepared to adjust speed or lane position accordingly to maintain safety and traffic flow.",

Overtake when an adjacent lane is clear and it is safe to merge back. Stay vigilant for any sudden stops or speed changes from the construction vehicle. Continuous observation of the van's behavior as well as tracking the pace of the traffic ahead will be important for smooth and safe driving."
