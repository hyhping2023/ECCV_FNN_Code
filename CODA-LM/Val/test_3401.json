        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several road users and obstacles that present unique challenges and considerations for autonomous driving behavior. Firstly, there is a truck parked ahead on the road, which is partially blocking the lane. This situation suggests that the vehicle might have to take a detour or enter an adjacent lane to safely pass the truck. Additionally, a car is observed parked on the right side of the road, which, although it does not block the lane directly, limits the available road space and necessitates careful maneuvering to avoid any potential issues.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is an adult crossing the road in front of the car, highlighted by the car's headlights. Since pedestrians have the right of way, and considering the safety hazards they pose, the vehicle is required to either stop or yield to avoid any dangerous situations.\n\nFinally, the presence of barriers, in this case, snow piled up by the roadside, further complicates the driving scenario. The reduced usable width of the road due to the snow piles demands a reduction in speed and an increase in vigilance from the vehicle to ensure safe passage.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in the scene, indicating that these elements do not currently pose challenges or considerations for navigating the observed traffic scene."

    "driving_suggestion": "As pedestrians are crossing the street, our vehicle should come to a complete stop to ensure their safe passage. The vehicle should also be ready to stop at the upcoming red light. Extra caution is needed when passing parked vans and maneuvering around piles of snow. The wet and potentially icy road conditions should prompt our vehicle to maintain a lower speed and a longer following distance. Appropriately using headlights and hazard lights can help improve visibility and communication with other road users. After the pedestrians have crossed at the crosswalk and since the light ahead is red, our vehicle should remain stopped. Only when the green light comes on and it is safe should we continue driving. Please make sure to leave enough space for pedestrians with dogs, so they can safely reach the right side of the road.",
