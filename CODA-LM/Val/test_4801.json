        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image being observed, there are several notable road users and objects that have implications for driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there's a black sedan parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the viewing perspective. It is partially obstructing the rightmost lane, which can affect the driving route by reducing available drivable area. Careful navigation is required to pass through or around this obstacle without any issues.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are observed parked on both sides of the road, within designated parking zones. These cars help delineate the traffic lanes from parking areas. As a consequence, driving through this environment demands heightened caution to avoid any collision with these stationary vehicles, as they define the limits of the safe driving space available.\n\nAnother point of interest is the presence of cardboard boxes and other miscellaneous items piled up beside the road, on the right side of the image. While they are not placed directly in the path of oncoming vehicles, they indicate that there might be loading or unloading activities nearby. This could potentially lead to unexpected pedestrian movement or temporary blockages, suggesting a need for vigilance in anticipation of sudden changes in the road environment.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are identified in this image, indicating their absence or irrelevance in the current traffic scenario. This summary encapsulates all the crucial information provided, relating to both the physical and implicit conditions that could influence driving decisions and safety measures."

    "driving_suggestion": "Due to the potential for unforeseeable pedestrian activity around parked vehicles and cardboard boxes, self-driving cars should reduce speed and be prepared to stop or yield. They should maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and remain vigilant for pedestrians that may emerge from between vehicles. Since the parked sedan occupies part of the rightmost lane, self-driving cars should also be prepared to navigate within the narrow lane. If there is oncoming traffic, the self-driving car may need to wait for a clear road before continuing. Furthermore, the presence of loading and unloading activities means that self-driving cars should be ready to stop or avoid unexpected obstacles. Self-driving cars should keep a safe following distance, slow down, and be prepared to stop.",
