        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, several categories of road users are present. \n\nFirst, two vehicles are noted. A white SUV has come to a stop directly in front of our vehicle, slightly to the left, with its brake lights off, potentially indicating it might be moving or about to move. This affects the following distance and speed adjustment of our vehicle, as it directly influences our driving path on the same lane. Additionally, there are several vehicles in the rightmost lane, including a delivery truck and some cars, partially obscured by construction workers and obstacles. This suggests that traffic in this lane may move slowly or stop frequently due to road construction activities.\n\nWithin the category of vulnerable road users, two observations are made. A construction worker wearing high-visibility clothing is near the divider on the right side, indicating potential road construction that might require our vehicle to slow down and be prepared for sudden movements or temporary traffic control. Additionally, pedestrians can be seen on the distant left sidewalk beyond the obstacle. It's important to monitor these pedestrians in case they attempt to cross the road or there is a crosswalk ahead.\n\nIn the traffic cones category, a series of yellow and black traffic cones line both sides of the road, directing the flow of traffic likely due to a construction site or road obstruction. This requires a safe merge to the left or lane adjustment for our vehicle.\n\nIn terms of barriers, temporary red traffic barriers placed along the central divider have narrowed the lanes, indicating ongoing construction work or potential road hazards. This necessitates a reduction in speed and heightened vigilance. Additionally, on the right side of the road, there is a large green construction barrier used to shield the worksite, limiting visibility of potential hazards and marking the construction area, which requires caution when driving alongside them.\n\nFinally, in the other objects category, workers are seen loading and unloading a pile of boxes to and from a red vehicle by the roadside. These activities may lead to obstacles or distractions on the road."
