Notably, one vehicle is parked close to the center on the right side, potentially reducing the available driving space. This requires the autonomous vehicle to proceed cautiously to ensure a safe distance is maintained and to avoid any collisions with the parked cars.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic cone positioned on the right side of the road, close to a pile of debris. This cone may indicate ongoing roadwork or the presence of an obstruction. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle must navigate around this area with caution to maintain safety.\n\nNear the traffic cone, there is also a distinct pile of debris. The location and presence of this debris pose a risk to the vehicle's tires and undercarriage. The autonomous vehicle needs to alter its driving path to avoid this hazard, steering around it to prevent any potential vehicular damage."
