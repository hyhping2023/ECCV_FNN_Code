        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, there are multiple traffic signs present. One set includes signs indicating a speed limit of 30 km/h, an advance warning for road works, and a parking sign showing availability to the right. These signs inform drivers not to exceed the 30 km/h speed limit and prepare them for potential changes or obstructions ahead due to the construction. Additionally, directional arrow signs are mounted on orange-and-white barriers, signaling a change in traffic patterns, which means drivers must adapt to a new directed pathâ€”typically because of ongoing road works.\n\nMoreover, strategically placed orange and white traffic cones, with red and white barriers, delineate areas where the road is closed or has restrictions. These traffic cones and barriers guide vehicles away from the affected zones ensuring a safe path.\n\nLastly, there are red and white striped barriers that attach to the traffic cones, creating a no-entry zone. These barriers physically restrict access and are usually in place to safeguard an area from vehicle entry during construction activities or temporary road closures. No vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights or other objects are reported in this scene."
