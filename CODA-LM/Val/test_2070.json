This truck's position could impact traffic flow and suggests nearby construction, so the ego car should be cautious of potential movements or merging back into traffic from the truck.\n   - Multiple parked cars are aligned on the right side of the road along the curb. These vehicles reduce the available lane width for the ego car and could obscure pedestrians or objects that may enter the road.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Dimly visible signs on the right side of the road, including a possibly blue rectangular sign with unidentified content. Although the exact nature of the signs is unclear, their presence indicates potential directives or information relevant to the ego vehicle's driving behavior.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - A barrier is visible on the right, separating the construction site from the road. This barrier indicates upcoming road work and could signal possible obstructions or reduced lanes, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution."

Pass the row of parked vehicles cautiously and watch for any movement that may suggest a vehicle is about to pull out. Maintain a moderate speed that will allow for enough reaction time if unexpected obstructions or movements occur. If safe and legal to do so, consider changing lanes to the left to avoid the construction vehicle and parked cars, while being mindful of the traffic around you. Reduce speed to improve reaction time in case of unexpected hazards emerging from the parked vehicles or construction area."
