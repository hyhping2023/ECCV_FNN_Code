        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a large, heavy truck directly in front of the autonomous vehicle (ego car). This truck occupies the entire lane and significantly obstructs the view ahead. The presence of the truck is particularly challenging because its close proximity and considerable size restrict the ego car's ability to maneuver and see further down the road. These limitations are critical as they impair the autonomous vehicle's capability to make timely and informed driving decisions based on the road conditions and environment ahead. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the image, making the heavy truck the primary focus for navigational consideration in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large commercial vehicle, commonly referred to as a truck. It is a vehicle designed to transport cargo, materials, or goods and is an integral part of the logistics and transportation industry. The size and mass of such a vehicle generally require more space for maneuvering and longer distances to come to a complete stop. The presence of this truck on the road directly ahead of the ego vehicle influences the driving behavior as it necessitates maintaining a greater following distance to allow for safe braking and reaction times. Additionally, the driver of the ego vehicle should be aware of the truck's potential to make wide turns, its slower acceleration, and the possibility of reduced visibility if attempting to overtake.",

Use headlights and any available night vision assistance systems to improve visibility. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down, as the limited visibility around the truck might conceal road signs, traffic signals, or other road users. Adaptive cruise control, if available, can be set to ensure a consistent gap is maintained from the truck."
