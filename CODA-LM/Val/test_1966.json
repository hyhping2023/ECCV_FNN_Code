This parked vehicle might impact the driving behavior as it reduces the amount of road available to the ego car, a situation that could become especially tricky if there are oncoming vehicles or additional obstacles present. Additionally, brightly colored traffic cones are placed on the same side of the road, suggesting there might be road work or some sort of hazard present. These cones indicate that there might be an obstruction or a reduction in lane width ahead, requiring the ego car to possibly adjust its lane position or be ready to stop if necessary. Other categories of road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects do not have any entries in this image, suggesting their absence or irrelevance in this specific scenario."
