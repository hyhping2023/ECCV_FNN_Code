A yellow construction truck is parked perpendicular to the road behind red barriers, indicating a work zone where the ego car should be cautious of potential changes in traffic patterns or construction equipment movements. A white car is parked parallel on the opposite side of the median and should be monitored for any movement despite not affecting the ego car's path directly. There is also a white sedan parked on the right side, facing the direction of the ego car, which narrows the drivable space and necessitates careful clearance when passing. A light-colored minivan and a small white pickup truck are on the opposite side of the road; both are stationary and should be monitored for unexpected maneuvers.\n\nIn the **vulnerable road users** category, several pedestrians are visible near the construction zone beyond the red barriers. These pedestrians can be unpredictable, requiring the ego car to be ready to stop or slow down if they attempt to cross the road.\n\nConcerning **traffic signs**, multiple signs are posted on a blue board next to the construction zone, though the specific instructions are not legible from this angle. Their presence at the construction site suggests there could be specific driving instructions like reduced speed limits or detours that the ego car should follow.\n\nA **traffic light** is visible on the right-hand side, next to the white car, showing a red light for the lane going in the opposite direction to the ego car. While informational for the ego car, this suggests that cross-traffic may soon enter the intersection.\n\n**Barriers** present include red plastic barriers separating the construction zone from the lane available to the ego car. These barriers reduce the available road width and guide traffic safely around the construction zone, necessitating the ego car to adjust its lane position to maintain a safe distance.\n\nNo additional objects or traffic cones are noted to be affecting the driving conditions in this image."

It should adhere to any work zone speed limits and be prepared for sudden stops or changes in the flow of traffic. The ego car should make lane adjustments early to safely navigate around the barriers while also being ready to react to the movements of parked vehicles and pedestrians."
