The first vehicle is partially visible in front of the ego car, with the left part of the image cropped, suggesting it is traveling ahead. This vehicle necessitates careful monitoring by the autonomous system to adjust speed and following distance appropriately, as it may stop or turn suddenly.\n\nThe second vehicle is a blue and white car located further ahead, partially on the right side of the road. This vehicle could influence the lane choices of the self-driving car, as it might move unexpectedly or its doors could open, potentially disrupting traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are large industrial cable reels stacked on the right side of the road, in front of the vehicle. While not directly on the road, their proximity indicates that the area may be an industrial zone, which could result in increased traffic, unexpected stops, or vehicles entering the road, all of which the autonomous driving system must be prepared to handle."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a slow speed and keep a safe distance from the police car in case it stops suddenly or makes any maneuvers. Be vigilant for other road users or work vehicles that may emerge from the industrial area on the right. Additionally, be aware of any temporary signs or signals that may have been placed on the road ahead due to police presence or industrial activities. Drive carefully, keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and be prepared for unexpected actions by the police car. Stay alert for potential dangers caused by large rolls of cable at the roadside. Comply with all standard driving rules and be ready to adjust your speed or position at any time. Approach parked vehicles with caution and be prepared to stop or navigate around unexpected obstacles. Maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles to allow enough time to react if a door opens or there is movement around the vehicle. Furthermore, be mindful of blind spots that may be caused by large cable reels or other objects on the road.",

These drums are positioned adjacent to the driving path of the ego car. While they are not directly obstructing the vehicle's route, the presence of such objects suggests that the area may be a storage or industrial site.
