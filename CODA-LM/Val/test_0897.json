On the right side of the road, there are multiple pedestrians close to a doorway. The presence of pedestrians in this area is critical as they might unexpectedly step onto the roadway. Therefore, it is important for the vehicle to reduce speed and be ready to come to a halt if necessary.\n\nOn the left side of the road, traffic cones with red and white stripes indicate the presence of potential road work or unseen obstacles. Although they are not directly obstructing the vehicle's path, their presence warrants increased awareness and caution.\n\nAdditionally, concrete barriers are placed on the left side of the road. These barriers are intended to steer vehicular traffic and provide pedestrian safety. Consequently, they serve to narrow the traffic lane which requires drivers to adjust their lane positioning.\n\nThere are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the traffic image that would impact the autonomous driving behavior."
