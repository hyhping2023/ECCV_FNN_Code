The driver should also stay alert for possible lane changes from other vehicles reacting to the construction vehicle and the signal change. If the light turns green, proceed with caution, keeping an eye on the construction vehicle's indicators for any sudden stops or turns. Maintain a safe distance from the large truck ahead, stay alert for any potential maneuvers by other vehicles around, especially the white car in the left mirror and the dark-colored sedan to the right. Continue to proceed while the traffic light is green but be prepared to stop if it changes."
