It appears to be stationary with no visible driver or intention to move. This parked van may limit the visibility of traffic or pedestrians on the left side, requiring the ego car to approach with caution. Although it does not pose an immediate threat, its presence narrows the drivable road space, necessitating increased attention to oncoming traffic.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:** People are sitting on chairs and standing near a bus stop, which is adjacent to the road on the right side. These individuals are potential pedestrians that may enter the road either to board or alight from a bus. This uncertain behavior necessitates the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down, even though they are currently not on the roadway.\n\n**Barriers:** Temporary fencing or barriers are along the left side of the road beyond the parked van, possibly indicating construction or a closed area. These barriers suggest a change in road conditions or limitations in maneuverability for the ego car, potentially requiring a lane change or reduced speed. The barriers also indicate the possibility of workers or machinery ahead, necessitating increased caution.\n\n**Other Objects:** There are several miscellaneous objects like chairs in proximity to the bus stop, and a light pole situated in front of the barriers on the left. Although these objects are not immediate hazards, their presence near the road indicates that the driving environment may be dynamic and requires close monitoring."

Approach the area with the construction barriers with caution in case of any road workers or unexpected obstacles that may appear."
