Notably, there is a large green tanker truck positioned diagonally to the left of the ego vehicle, occupying parts of two lanes. This truck affects visibility and lane space, requiring cautious driving and possibly a lane change. On the right, there are multiple vehicles, including trucks and cars, stuck in a traffic jam parallel to the ego vehicle, which may indicate congested conditions ahead. Additionally, a red truck is parked perpendicular to the road on the right, partially obstructing the lane and necessitating reduced speed and increased vigilance. Several vehicles, including a red truck and smaller passenger cars, are also parked along the right side, indicating reduced lane width and the potential for unexpected pedestrian movements between vehicles.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are visible in the image, which simplifies the driving scenario, but cautious observance is still required as they may be hidden from view. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are identified in the immediate scene."

Continuous monitoring of any lane openings or hazards is recommended. Additionally, because the road is wet, the ego car should be cautious of hydroplaning and brake gently to avoid skidding."
