The truck's position directly affects the ego car's ability to proceed forward. Its size and brake lights suggest that it is either slowing down or stopped, which requires the ego car to also slow or stop to maintain a safe following distance."

The oncoming car requires monitoring to maintain situational awareness, but it does not pose an immediate threat as it is in a different lane."

        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the ego car is facing several road elements and road users. Directly ahead, there is a large yellow and red truck occupying the same lane as the ego car appears to be stationary or moving slowly based on its engaged hazard lights and visible brake light. The truck may have stopped due to a roadside incident or is moving with caution. The ego car must consequently slow down or be prepared to change lanes to avoid the truck, as it impedes the ego car's path.\n\nParallel to the ego car and truck, there is a white car moving in the same direction in the left lane. Additionally, there is another white car situated on the opposite lane, facing the opposite direction. The presence of the white car in the left lane should be considered by the ego car in case a lane change is decided upon to avoid the truck. The oncoming white car, meanwhile, does not pose an immediate danger as it travels in a different lane, but it remains important to be aware of its presence.\n\nAlthough there are no influential traffic signs impacting the immediate driving decisions, there are generic street name signs that aid in navigation but do not necessitate any immediate response from the ego car.\n\nThe traffic situation is further defined by the traffic lights located at the upcoming intersection, where the green light is lit for the direction in which the ego car is traveling. This permits the ego car to continue through the intersection; however, caution is advised due to the truckâ€™s unpredictable status.\n\nFinally, a yellow median barrier is located to the left side of the truck, which enforces the separation of traffic lanes and signals to the ego car that left turns or lane crossings are forbidden in this location.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene according to the data."

Avoid abrupt lane changes; signal early and check the mirrors and blind spots before attempting to move into a different lane, taking into account the position of the white car in the adjacent lane. Since the traffic light is green, prepare to proceed through the intersection if it is safe to do so, ensuring that any lane change is completed well before reaching the crosswalk to ensure safety and compliance with traffic laws. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead and remain alert for the truck's movements. As the light is green, the ego vehicle should be prepared to proceed when the truck moves while remaining aware of the barrier's restrictions and the oncoming traffic. Since no left turn is allowed due to the median barrier, it should plan to either proceed straight or turn right if it's in the correct lane for such a maneuver."
