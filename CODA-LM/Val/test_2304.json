        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles and some other objects. A large yellow construction vehicle, which might be a loader, is positioned on the left side of the road with a driver visible inside. It's obstructing one side of the narrow road, facing the ego vehicle, implying that it may move into or away from the ego vehicle's path; this requires the ego vehicle to either slow down or stop temporarily until there is a clear way to pass. Additionally, there is a blue truck parked further down the left side of the road, facing away from the ego vehicle. Although the truck is not moving, its presence reduces the available driving space, necessitating an adjustment in the ego vehicle's trajectory to ensure safe passage.\n\nRegarding other objects, the scene has various electricity poles and wires over the road. They are not obstructing the carriageway, but they are still relevant for maintaining general awareness, especially should there be instances of low-hanging or fallen wires that could pose a hazard. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this particular traffic situation."

This heavy machinery is recognized by its articulated steering and the large bucket attachment at its front end, indicating its use for moving materials at a construction site. The presence of this vehicle on or near the roadway would mandate the driver of the ego vehicle to be cautious and prepared to stop or slow down if necessary, as the construction vehicle may obstruct the path, enter the road, or cause construction debris to be present.",

Prepare to stop if the construction vehicle begins to move or if there isn't enough space to safely navigate around it. Signal intentions to ensure the operator of the construction vehicle is aware of the ego vehicle's presence. If necessary, yield the right of way to the construction vehicle if it is actively working or if there isn't enough room to pass safely. Always be prepared for unexpected movements from the construction vehicle or any other unseen road users that may emerge from blind corners or adjacent properties. Additionally, watch for any signs of activity from workers or equipment that could affect traffic flow."
