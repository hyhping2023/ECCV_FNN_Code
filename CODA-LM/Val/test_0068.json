Vehicles present include a white hatchback car stopped directly ahead, with its brake lights on, influencing the ego car's following distance and stopping behavior. A white bus also stopped in the same lane further influences the car's movement, indicating that it might be in the process of passenger exchange or halted due to the traffic flow. Additionally, various parked cars are spotted to the right side of the road, which may affect the drivable width of the road and necessitate monitoring for unexpected movements.\n\nVulnerable road users are represented by a pedestrian on the right, walking away from the ego car, potentially posing a risk if they were to enter the driving lane. Another person wearing a high-visibility jacket walks in the opposite lane and requires attention as they could cross the road or impact other traffic participants’ behavior.\n\nA significant traffic feature in the scenario is a single traffic sign—a blue informational sign with a 'P' symbol—indicating a parking area to the right. This sign is indicative of the surrounding parked cars and the increased likelihood of vehicle and pedestrian movements relating to the parking area.\n\nThe driving environment is further complicated by a row of traffic cones placed on the right side of the ego car's lane, resulting in a narrower lane and necessitating an adjustment in the ego car's lane position to maintain safe passage.\n\nIn this particular scene, there are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects identified that could influence the autonomous driving system's decision-making processes."
