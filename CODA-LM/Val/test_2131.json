Our vehicle should monitor whether the other vehicle has any sudden stops or turns, as these may affect its own driving route. \n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the right, wearing a red jacket and black pants. Even though there are currently no pedestrians on the road, autonomous vehicles should be prepared to stop or slow down in case pedestrians suddenly step onto the street. \n\nLastly, at the intersection ahead, there is a traffic light on the right showing a green signal.
