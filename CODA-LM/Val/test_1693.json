        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the ego vehicle is presented with a few important road elements. Notably, there is a large white truck in the right lane adjacent to the ego vehicle. It mostly remains within its lane but slightly encroaches towards the lane of the ego car. This situation requires careful attention as the truck's size and proximity could limit visibility and potentially pose a risk of sudden lane changes or unforeseen hazards such as falling debris. Maintaining a safe lateral distance from the truck is also important for the ego vehicle's safety.\n\nAbove the roadway, overhead directional signs are visible. These provide information about the lane directions and possible destinations which are essential for navigational decisions. Depending on the desired route, the ego vehicle might need to prepare for lane changes.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a designated zone marked by yellow and black reflective traffic cones. These cones are forming a barrier indicating that part of the road may be closed off or under construction and may pose a hazard. The ego car must stay in its lane, clear of the cones, to navigate past this section safely.\n\nAdditionally, Jersey barriers are positioned to the far right side of the traffic cones. These barriers delineate the active road from a restricted area, possibly a construction site, signaling that the ego vehicle should keep to the available lanes intended for travel.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in this traffic scene that impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a brightly colored cone made of plastic or rubber. It is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It typically signals caution, provides a barrier to protect construction areas, guide traffic around an obstacle, or signal areas where vehicles should not drive. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests there may be construction, an accident, or another hazard ahead on the road, and it may indicate that the ego vehicle should potentially change lanes or slow down to navigate the situation safely.",

Stay in the current lane as indicated by the traffic cones while preparing for any necessary lane changes ahead as per the overhead directional signs. Monitoring the truck's signals and brake lights will inform if it intends to change lanes or slow down, and matching speed with traffic flow is advised to maintain a smooth drive. Stay attuned to the traffic cones and potential merges ahead, being prepared to change lanes safely if necessary. Act according to the overhead traffic signs to navigate the upcoming junction or interchange, and reduce speed appropriately for nighttime driving conditions and limited visibility."
