The ego car should be cautious of the truck's movements and be aware that such large vehicles have larger blind spots. The truck's size and position may obstruct the view of the ego car and it may also indicate the presence of a construction area or heavy equipment movement."

The ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down as well. This vehicle indicates that the traffic is currently slow or stopped, meaning the ego car should maintain a safe following distance."

The status of the traffic lights cannot be determined, so the ego car should follow the flow of traffic and pay attention to the brake lights of the car in front."

        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, the ego car is presented with a couple of road user elements to consider. Ahead and central to the roadway, there is a large truck with reflective markings, signifying it as a potential moving obstacle. The ego car needs to maintain a safe distance from this truck, be cautious of its movements, and consider that the truck's size may not only block the road view but also suggest ongoing construction or heavy equipment activity.\n\nAdditionally, a red SUV is spotted in the same lane as the ego car, positioned in front with its brake lights on. This indicates that the SUV may be slowing down or stopping, signifying to the ego car that it must also prepare to adjust its speed or come to a halt while keeping a safe distance from the SUV. The activation of the SUV's brake lights also implies that traffic may be slow-moving or at a standstill.\n\nAs for traffic regulation indicators, there is a green traffic light visible beyond the truck, indicating that traffic in the ego car's lane is currently allowed to proceed. Nevertheless, the ego car should stay alert to the possibility of traffic light changes and be ready to respond accordingly, especially considering the truck's movements which could have an effect on the traffic flow.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene, and thus these categories do not require action from the ego car at this moment."

            "description and explanation": "A large, heavy-duty construction vehicle equipped with specialized components, likely used for construction or maintenance work. Its presence indicates that there might be construction activity ahead. The driver of the ego car should remain alert for potential slowdowns, lane changes, or detours associated with construction zones and maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle to avoid any debris or equipment that may extend from the vehicle. The size and function of the construction vehicle may also suggest that it moves slower than typical road traffic, thus the ego vehicle should be prepared to adjust speed accordingly.",

The ego car should not attempt to overtake unless it is safe and legally permitted, especially considering the limited visibility of any oncoming traffic that may be obscured by the truck. Anticipate potential stops and starts due to the size of the truck and the SUV's activated brake lights. The ego car should continue to follow the red SUV at a safe distance, monitoring its brake lights for changes in speed. Caution should be used when driving near the large truck to the right, ensuring that the ego vehicle remains visible to the truck driver and is prepared for potential lane changes or wide turns by the truck. Continued monitoring of the road ahead for any unexpected events or obstacles is advised. No other specific actions are required at this moment, given the current visible scene. The ego car should remain at a safe distance behind the red SUV, observing its brake lights for signs of movement. Caution should be maintained due to the presence of a large truck, which could be indicative of nearby construction or other potential road hazards ahead. In the absence of visible traffic lights or signs, the ego car should be prepared to stop or proceed based on the surrounding traffic flow."
