The truck's proximity and size might reduce visibility for the driver, necessitating maintaining a safe following distance and readiness for sudden stops or turns. Additionally, several cars are visible ahead of the ego vehicle at various distances, driving in the same direction. Their positions will dictate the ego vehicle's speed, following distance, and possible overtaking actions.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, construction workers are present ahead on the right side of the road near traffic cones and barriers. This requires extra caution, reduced speed, and preparedness for any sudden movements into the roadway.\n\nA green traffic light can be seen ahead, indicating that the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed but should remain alert for any changes in the signal.\n\nOrange traffic cones are positioned along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, marking a construction zone. These cones dictate lane borders and restrict vehicle movement, requiring the ego vehicle to stay within the modified lane delineations.\n\nConcrete barriers and fencing are present on the right, demarcating a construction area. These barriers channel traffic away from the construction zone, resulting in a narrowed driving path for the ego vehicle.\n\nFinally, there is an irrelevant object category where questions about image capabilities are not described and bear no influence on the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
