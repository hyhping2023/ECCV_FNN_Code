On the left lane, there's a white car traveling in the same direction, positioned about three car lengths ahead of our vehicle, which requires attention to maintain a safe following distance. Another white car is spotted in the left lane but on the opposite side of the road, proceeding in the direction of traffic there, which doesn't demand immediate focus since it's separated by a median.\n\nAdditionally, ahead on the right side, a group of workers wearing orange high-visibility jackets can be seen, accompanied by a handcart. This group is close to the driving path which might present a safety risk. As a result, it is essential for autonomous vehicles to be prepared to reduce speed or come to a stop to avoid any accidents.\n\nIn relation to the workers, there are several orange traffic cones placed around the work area. These cones serve as indicators of potential work or obstacles on the road and could imply that there are lane closures or other cautions that drivers must observe.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this scenario."

When changing lanes, be vigilant of any potential movements from the white sedan in the neighboring lane. Be prepared to slow down as you approach the workers and traffic cones on the right side ahead, and drive carefully. If necessary, be ready to stop at any time. Follow the traffic sign instructions and do not enter the area on the right side. Overall, respect the road construction zones, drive cautiously, and stay alert to the surrounding traffic.",
