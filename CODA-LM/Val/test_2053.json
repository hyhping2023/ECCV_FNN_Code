Firstly, there is a green truck loaded with materials, spotted in the opposite lane and heading in the opposite direction. This truck isn't affecting our vehicle's driving behavior as there's no indication of any abnormal movement. Secondly, we see a yellow excavator being transported on a long trailer on the lane next to ours, going in the same direction. The presence of the trailer requires cautiousness from our self-driving vehicle regarding lane changes and speed adjustments due to its size and length.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes several black garbage bags placed on the sidewalk by the roadside. While they are not in the way now, there's a need for vigilance since they could potentially enter the driving lanes and become a hazard."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain your current lane and speed, observe traffic rules, and keep a safe distance from all vehicles. Be vigilant for any unstable movements or sudden obstacles that may arise from other vehicles. Continuously monitor the surrounding environment, pay attention to any changes in traffic signs or signals, and adjust your driving behavior accordingly. Keep a sufficient safety distance from the flatbed truck ahead to allow ample reaction time in case of a sudden stop. Watch for any signs of lane-changing from the green truck in the adjacent lane, and be prepared to adjust your position accordingly. Be cautious about garbage bags on the roadside, and be ready in case they suddenly roll into your lane.",

The construction vehicle's presence on the road indicates there may be construction activity nearby, which could impact traffic conditions and flow. The ego vehicle may need to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for potential stops or slow-moving traffic associated with the transportation of such equipment.",
