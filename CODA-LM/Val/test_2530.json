It has a visible rotating drum and construction markings, and its rear lights are on, which may indicate that it is slowing down or stopping. This truck's presence requires the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to avoid a potential rear-end collision. Additionally, there is a white van in the adjacent lane to the left, traveling at a similar speed and distance as the cement mixer truck, which could restrict the ego car's ability to change lanes to the left if needed.\n\nNo traffic signs are visible in the image that would directly impact the immediate driving decisions of the ego car, implying that standard road rules should be followed without any special adjustments. The traffic lights are present above the road, but their state is unclear from the image, necessitating that the ego car proceed with caution and be ready to stop if the lights change.\n\nYellow and black striped construction barriers are visible on the right, indicating a construction area that may cause lane narrowing or closures, thus requiring careful navigation. Similarly, yellow and black striped road divider barriers are on the right-hand side of the ego vehicle, suggesting that lane merging or changes might be restricted.\n\nLastly, there are no discernible debris or irregularities on the road surface in the image, so while the ego car should stay alert, there is no need for immediate evasive maneuvers."

The wet road conditions require additional caution. Since the other vehicle in the left lane is parallel to the mixer truck, the ego car should not attempt a lane change at this moment but rather wait for a clear and safe opportunity to either follow the truck or change lanes if the traffic situation and road signage ahead allow for it. As the state of the traffic light cannot be confirmed, the ego car should be ready to adjust to the traffic light when it becomes visible and clearly recognizable."
