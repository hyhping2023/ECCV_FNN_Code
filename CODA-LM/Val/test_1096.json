This necessitates that the driver stays in their own lane and maintains a safe speed due to the oncoming traffic. \n\nOn the right side of the road, a smart parking sign is visible, which indicates that parking may be required in the area ahead. The vehicle must stop or park in this area and wait for clearance before proceeding further.\n\nTraffic cones, alternately colored red and white, are tilted to the left side, suggesting that the lane is closed or it is a construction area. These cones guide the flow of traffic and indicate that the vehicle should stay in the current lane and avoid overtaking from the right.\n\nAdditionally, white safety barriers are present on both sides of the road, marking construction or temporary obstacle areas. These barriers safely guide vehicles through potentially hazardous sections of the road, possibly indicating a road narrowing ahead.\n\nLastly, the windshield is damp, implying recent precipitation, which can affect road conditions. Wet and slippery surfaces reduce tire traction and visibility, requiring the driver to reduce speed and increase braking distance for safety."

    "driving_suggestion": "Please approach the intersection cautiously, noting that the left lane is closed due to traffic cones, and observe any additional signs or instructions prompted by construction or roadworks. Drive slowly and increase your attention due to the wet road conditions. Stay alert to workers, changes in traffic patterns, or unexpected obstacles. Follow traffic regulations and consider parking or stopping nearby based on smart parking signs. Your vehicle should maintain a safe driving speed and stay vigilant. Be prepared for the presence of traffic cones and obstacles, which may indicate road works or lane closures ahead. It is advisable to monitor oncoming traffic while continuing to drive to ensure that they remain in their own lanes.",

In this scenario, a cone is used to signal that the drivers should steer clear of the area to their right, possibly due to roadworks or an obstruction. Since the traffic cone is present, the ego car must navigate the road while maintaining a safe distance from the cone, ensuring it does not go into the area that has been sectioned off for safety reasons.",
