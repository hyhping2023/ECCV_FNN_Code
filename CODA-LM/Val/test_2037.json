This truck may reduce the roadway's width and could stop or turn suddenly, impacting the flow of traffic. Additionally, a white car is driving on the left lane ahead, moving in the same direction, which could influence the lane-changing and speed-adjusting behavior of self-driving vehicles. Moreover, traffic barriers are present on the right side of the road, marking the boundary between the vehicle lane and the pedestrian area. These barriers help delineate the driving space, preventing vehicles from entering non-driving areas."

Observe the behavior of the white car, anticipating its potential lane changes or deceleration to avoid affecting your vehicle. If necessary and safe, consider changing lanes to the left to overtake the truck that is obstructing the flow of traffic. Always ensure to use the turn signal and check the blind spot before changing lanes. It is recommended to continuously monitor the surrounding environment to timely respond to other road users and maintain safety.",

The presence of this truck on the road ahead will likely influence the driver of the ego car to maintain a safe following distance due to the size and potential stopping distance of the truck. Additionally, adequate space should be allowed for the truck to maneuver, as larger vehicles may require wider turns or may move more slowly through traffic.",
