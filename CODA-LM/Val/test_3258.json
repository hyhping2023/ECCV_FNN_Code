A large concrete mixer truck is directly ahead in the same lane, occupying most of the lane width and slightly skewed to the right. This truck might slow down traffic and could make sudden movements, requiring the ego car to be cautious. Additionally, a red truck is visible on the right side of the image, parked by the roadside ahead, adjacent to a pedestrian crossing. This parked truck may obstruct the view of the crossing, and there could be pedestrians that are not immediately visible to the ego car.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road, indicating the presence of a pedestrian crossing ahead. Drivers need to be alert for pedestrians that may cross the road, potentially necessitating the stopping or slowing down of the ego car.\n\nThere is also a blue pedestrian crossing traffic sign clearly visible on the right side of the road, beside the parked red truck. This sign indicates an upcoming pedestrian crosswalk, and the ego car should prepare to yield to pedestrians.\n\nFurthermore, barriers are present on the right side of the road. One set of barriers delineates a construction or maintenance area adjacent to the pedestrian crossing, indicating a potential obstruction or distraction for road users, including the ego car. There is also a solid barrier on the right side of the road, separating the sidewalk from the road. This barrier emphasizes the need for the ego car to stay within road boundaries and be cautious of pedestrians that might emerge from behind the barrier."

Drivers behind this truck should maintain a larger following distance to account for potential stops or slowdowns as the vehicle may be navigating to or from a construction site.

The driver should be prepared to stop or slow down for pedestrians at the pedestrian crossing, especially since the red truck might be blocking the view of the crossing. Monitoring the truck's right side for any emerging pedestrians or cyclists, and reducing speed accordingly, would be advisable. Passing the mixer truck may be considered if there's a safe opportunity to do so, ensuring that there's another lane available and it's legal to pass. Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead to allow for ample stopping time, especially given the potentially wet road conditions. Remain vigilant for pedestrians due to the pedestrian crossing sign, and be prepared to reduce speed as you approach the pedestrian crossing area. Continue monitoring the road conditions and adjust speed if necessary to maintain control and react safely to unexpected situations."
