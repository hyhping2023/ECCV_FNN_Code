        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene in question is composed of several elements affecting the movement of the ego car. Directly in front of the ego car, there is a large industrial vehicle, possibly a truck or a bus, with amber warning lights activated at the top. This suggests that the vehicle might be stationary or moving slowly, potentially due to construction or a similar activity, creating an obstruction likely to slow or stop the progression of the ego car.\n\nIn addition to this, a sedan is discernible in front of the construction vehicle, slightly to the left, indicating that a queue of traffic is forming because of the roadblock. The ego car must therefore approach cautiously, ready for possible stop-and-go scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, several cars in the adjacent lane to the left are moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles could affect the ego car's ability to change lanes safely, a maneuver that might become necessary to bypass the stationary construction vehicle.\n\nOn the pedestrian front, there is an individual walking parallel to the road on the right side. They're close to the ego car's driving lane but aren't crossing the street, so there's no immediate threat to the flow of traffic. However, their proximity still warrants attention, as an unexpected attempt to cross the road would require the ego car to decelerate or stop to ensure safety.\n\nThe traffic light within sight shows green, which typically would allow traffic to proceed. However, the flow is still hampered by the large vehicle blocking the way.\n\nMetal barriers are installed on both sides of the road, which seem to direct the traffic, possibly indicating ongoing road work or a lane closure. These barriers reduce the ego vehicle's capacity for lane changes, further complicating the traffic situation.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the scene that affects the driving conditions for the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "A heavy construction vehicle is seen directly ahead. This type of vehicle is typically large and slow-moving, and it can often occupy more space on the road due to its size and the nature of its work. When driving behind such a vehicle, the driver would need to maintain a larger following distance to account for its potential stops and slow speed. Overtaking may be challenging and should only be done when it is safe and legal to do so.",

    "driving_suggestion": "Given the identified obstructions and potential hazards, the ego car should maintain a low speed and prepare to stop if necessary. Since the industrial vehicle in front has activated warning lights, the ego car should not attempt to pass until it is clear to do so safely. Monitoring the pedestrian on the right is crucial; preparedness to stop in the event of an unexpected crossing is advised. The ego car should also be ready for a possible lane change to the left if the debris obstructs the current lane and if the adjacent lane is confirmed to be clear. Caution and attentiveness to the road conditions and changes in traffic flow caused by the construction site are essential for safe navigation through this area."
