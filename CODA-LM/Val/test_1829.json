        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image presented, we have a red forklift parked on the right side of the road, with its orientation rear-end towards the direction our vehicle is travelling. It is significant because its movement may interfere with the driving path of our vehicle, necessitating an adjustment in speed and following distance to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes red and white striped barrier barrels at a construction site on the right, which are in place to prevent vehicles from entering the construction zone. These barriers indicate ongoing construction work and have the potential to reduce the drivable width of the road.\n\nFurthermore, there are large cylindrical tanks situated on the right side of the road, likely associated with the construction or maintenance activities observed. Although these tanks are static objects that might not direktly afect the car's immediate driving path,, they do pose a risk should activities related to them suddenly encroach onto the roadway.\n\nLastly, construction materials and large equipment are positioned adjacent to the barriers, reinforcing the importance of heightened alertness in construction areas due to the possibility of unexpected movements or the emergence of new obstacles."

    "driving_suggestion": "Drive carefully, be prepared to slow down or stop for pedestrians crossing the road. Closely monitor the movements of the forklift, as it may affect the drivable path. Continue to pay attention to specific prohibitions on traffic signs and ensure compliance. If necessary, prepare to merge to the left side of the road to avoid sections marked by traffic cones, ensuring it is done safely and does not conflict with potential instructions indicated by the aforementioned traffic signs. Due to signs of construction equipment and construction areas on the right side, the vehicle should reduce speed. Carefully avoid building materials parked on the right and stay in the lane not obstructed by construction equipment. Since no vulnerable road users are observed, the main consideration is motor vehicle traffic and following traffic light instructions.",

Its presence on the road is indicative of ongoing construction work nearby. Therefore, the ego car should proceed with caution, as there may be unexpected obstacles, workers on the road, or sudden movements from the construction vehicle itself. The driver may need to reduce speed and be prepared to stop or navigate around the construction zone.",
