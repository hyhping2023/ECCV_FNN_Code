        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a discernible presence of various road users and objects which collectively influence the driving behavior of the ego car. A primary focal point is the cleaning vehicle moving in the opposite direction to our car, situated in the middle of the road. Despite being at a considerable distance, its slow movement necessitates potential lane changes or speed adjustments by our car to maintain a safe progression.\n\nIn addition to the vehicle, the scene is characterized by the presence of overhead traffic signs. Although these signs appear in the distance, the details of their instructions are not clearly visible due to image resolution constraints. It is implied that these signs might carry critical information regarding lane usage, directions, or speed limits, adherence to which is essential for safe navigation.\n\nTraffic lights are also a notable part of the scene, with two red lights visible, each corresponding to separate lanes. This red indication mandates a halt at the intersection, signifying a moment of pause for both our vehicle and others sharing the road. The necessity to remain attentive to these lights is underscored, as any change in their status demands an immediate and appropriate response from the driver.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement of orange traffic cones on the left side delineates the boundary between the driving lane and an ongoing construction area. These cones serve as a visual guide, alerting drivers to the presence of construction and assisting in the navigation of the remaining drivable road space.\n\nA yellow temporary construction barrier is also observed on the right side of the road. This acts as a physical separator between the construction zone and the lanes available for vehicles, emphasizing the importance of cautious driving due to potential reductions in road width and the close proximity of construction activities.\n\nOverall, this comprehensive scene encapsulates interactions between static objects like traffic signs, lights, cones, and barriers, and dynamic elements such as vehicles, all of which necessitate prudent, informed decisions to navigate safely under varying road conditions."

    "driving_suggestion": "Maintain a safe distance from the cleaning vehicle ahead and be prepared to change lanes when necessary, while paying attention to road signs and traffic cone markings indicating lane changes and possible construction areas. Additionally, be aware of any temporary signs or signals related to the construction zone, which are usually marked by barriers. Be ready for possible speed changes, look out for overhead traffic signs to obtain important road information, and prepare to follow any construction signs as directed by traffic cones and barriers. If you see traffic lights, be prepared to adjust your speed according to their signals. Maintain a cautious speed while observing road conditions and other potential road users. Keep a safe distance from the truck ahead, watching its brake lights and turn signals to understand any changes in speed or direction. You cannot proceed at an intersection with a red light, but remain vigilant as you approach the intersection and be ready for changes in the light status. The presence of construction barriers and traffic cones indicates that you should reduce speed if necessary, stay alert, watch for any workers or unexpected obstacles, and do not attempt to enter areas blocked off by traffic cones. Adhering to these guidelines will help you safely navigate through the current traffic environment.",
