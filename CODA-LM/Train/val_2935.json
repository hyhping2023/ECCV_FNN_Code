The ego car should be cautious and ready to follow any directions given by the police due to the possibility of an ongoing incident or law enforcement activity. Along the roadside, green and orange traffic cones are placed, which suggests a construction zone or a temporary diversion, requiring the ego car to anticipate lane changes or other obstructions. Additionally, green mesh barriers are set up on the sides of the road, indicating there may be an active work zone, and thus the ego car needs to exercise additional caution for potential hazards or changes in road conditions. Lastly, there is smoke or dust visible in the distance, which could signal construction or other activities that might affect the roadway. The ego car must stay vigilant and be ready for any alterations in the road conditions. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights depicted in this image."
