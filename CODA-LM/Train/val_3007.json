This truck is partially blocking the ego car's lane, which could necessitate a lane change by the ego car to ensure safe passage around the truck. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the traffic. The ego car must maintain a safe distance when overtaking the cyclist and remain vigilant for any potential sudden movements or changes in the cyclist's direction. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

The presence of this vehicle on the road is an indicator of potential construction activity in the area. While driving, its crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle as it may stop unexpectedly or make sudden turns. Observing and anticipating the behavior of construction vehicles can help in avoiding collisions and ensuring safe navigation through the area.",

Additionally, the ego car should maintain a safely increased following distance from the truck, and give a wide berth to the cyclist while passing to ensure safety for all road users. Check rear-view and side mirrors and use turn signals before any lane changes."
