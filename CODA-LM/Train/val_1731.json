It is positioned on the right side of the road. This construction vehicle indicates the presence of a construction or work zone area. For the ego car, it means that the driver should be cautious, decrease speed, and be prepared for potential hazards or obstructions related to the ongoing construction activities. The presence of such a vehicle typically signifies that there may be workers nearby, changes in traffic patterns, or unexpected obstacles. Therefore, vigilance and adherence to any posted construction signs or temporarily adjusted traffic rules is necessary.",

It features visible characteristic like a large flatbed or loading deck and a raised cabin which is typical for heavy-duty vehicles used in construction scenarios. The presence of this vehicle indicates potential roadwork or obstructions ahead, suggesting that the ego car should proceed with caution. The vehicles size and purpose mean it might execute unpredictable movements, require additional space for maneuvering, or could be stationary for extended periods, obstructing the path. Adjusting speed and maintaining a vigilant watch on any further movements of this construction vehicle will be necessary to ensure safe passage.",
