A white car is located on the left side of the road ahead, moving away from our perspective, the ego car. This vehicle is not an immediate risk since it is moving away and not blocking our path, but it is important to keep an eye on its distance and relative speed for safety.\n\nAdditionally, there's a small, white, three-wheeled vehicle parked on the right shoulder of the road. This vehicle is currently not a direct threat but warrants caution from the ego car, as the possibility of sudden movement or doors opening from the parked vehicle could pose a risk.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, none are visible in the scene, which implies there's no need for the ego car to take immediate action concerning such road users.\n\nNo traffic signs that could influence driving behavior in the immediate vicinity are observed. Consequently, the ego car should continue to follow the standard traffic regulations applicable to the road.\n\nTraffic lights are also not present in this image, indicating that there is no requirement for the ego car to modify its behavior based on traffic signals in this particular scenario.\n\nLastly, a green dustbin is positioned on the right side of the road by the pavement. Although it doesn't present an immediate risk to the ego car, its presence should be acknowledged as a potential hazard if it were to be displaced into the roadway."
