            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used in road settings to mark areas where vehicles should not pass or to delineate construction zones and other temporary road alterations. These cones are bright and easily visible, often colored in fluorescent orange with a reflective strip to catch the light and the eye of drivers, ensuring they are noticed even from a distance or in poor light conditions. Given its placement on the road, the ego car should remain alert and may need to adjust its path to avoid the cone, maintaining safety and adhering to potential changes in traffic patterns or road layout indicated by the presence of the cone. Maintaining a safe distance from such obstacles is crucial to avoid collisions or damage to the vehicle.",

Traffic cones are typically used to mark temporary adjustments to traffic patterns, such as road work zones or lane divisions. They serve as visual cues to alert drivers to slow down, proceed with caution, or change lanes to maintain safety in a potentially hazardous area. In this scenario, the presence of a traffic cone may imply roadwork or an obstruction on the right side of the lane the ego car is traveling in, prompting the driver to possibly adjust lane position or reduce speed.",
