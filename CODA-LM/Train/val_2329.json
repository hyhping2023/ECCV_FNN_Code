This crane's size and position may obstruct part of the lane, limiting the maneuverability for the ego car.\n   - **Multiple stationary taxis**: Colored yellow and green, these taxis are parked by the edge of the roadway on the right. While parked, they could potentially move into traffic unexpectedly, so caution is needed when passing by.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - **Pedestrian**: Near the taxis on the right, standing close to the vehicles. Pedestrians can be unpredictable and might enter the roadway, necessitating that the ego car is prepared to stop or slow down if required.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - **Directional signage**: Located on the right side, it indicates parking areas and other points of interest. Although these signs do not immediately influence driving decisions, they provide important location information.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - **Traffic cones**: Positioned in front of the stationary taxis on the right, these cones suggest an area of caution or potential road work. They indicate the presence of obstacles or roadworks, requiring the ego car to reduce speed and proceed cautiously.\n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other objects were detected in the image."

Featuring a sizable crane mechanism along with multiple axles to support its heavy frame, this vehicle is robust and usually operates in areas requiring major construction work.

It's also advisable to keep a safe distance from the stationary vehicles on the right and the crane, keeping an eye out for any signs of them entering the road. Monitor the road ahead for any additional signage or changes in road conditions. If visibility or road conditions are poor, activating hazard lights could be considered to alert other road users to the ego car's presence."
