Additionally, there is a vulnerable road user, specifically a person wearing a high-visibility vest, standing near a construction vehicle on the side of the road. The ego car must exercise extra caution and be ready to slow down or stop, as the person may have to move into the road for work. Moreover, a construction vehicle with an extended arm is parked on the side, prompting the ego car to keep a safe distance since the vehicle may need to operate or move unexpectedly. Also present in the scene are power lines and utility poles along the side of the road; these necessitate the ego car to stay alert to possible obstacles or hazards associated with the utility infrastructure. The image contains no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that necessitate consideration in this context."
