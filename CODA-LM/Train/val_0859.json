        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, two vehicles are visible. The first is a black sedan positioned to the left of our ego vehicle and slightly ahead. It has its brake lights activated, which could signify that the vehicle is slowing down or coming to a stop. Consequently, this indicates to the ego car that it may need to decelerate in order to keep a safe distance from the sedan. Additionally, there is a yellow construction vehicle in the scene. It is located ahead of the ego car to the right, occupying the right lane and traveling in the same direction. The construction vehicle's presence demands extra caution; due to its larger size and potential for slower movement or unforeseen maneuvers, the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and be prepared to alter speed or switch lanes if necessary.\n\nNo other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the traffic image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a type of heavy machinery frequently used in roadway or building work. This vehicle features large, rugged wheels and equipment attached to the back, possibly for digging or lifting. Due to its presence on the road, it likely affects the traffic flow, requiring surrounding vehicles, including the ego car, to potentially reduce speed and maneuver carefully to maintain a safe distance. The involvement of such a vehicle in the traffic scene usually indicates nearby construction activity, which might involve additional precautions such as lane shifts or temporary closures.",

Monitor the construction vehicle in the right lane for any changes in speed or direction. No immediate actions required, but maintain a safe following distance and be ready to change lanes if the traffic situation ahead changes and it becomes necessary to overtake. Always observe for any implicit traffic cues that might not be visible from the current perspective, such as upcoming traffic lights or signs."
