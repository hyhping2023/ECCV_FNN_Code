There are two vehicles noted; a concrete mixer truck is in the left lane ahead with its brake lights on, which indicates it may be stationary or at a reduced speed, possibly due to construction work nearby. This truck poses an obstacle that might require unpredictable maneuvering or dealing with spillover construction on the road. Also, there's a white car right in front of the ego vehicle, in the right lane, with its brake lights on, suggesting either slow-moving traffic or a halt in progress, which requires the ego vehicle to be prepared to stop or slow down.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is spotted on the road's right side, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, and is wearing a light-colored hoodie. Given the close proximity, there's a need for careful monitoring of the cyclist since there's a risk of sudden movements that may require the ego car to adjust its speed or direction.\n\nAt the intersection ahead, the traffic lights are displaying a red light for the direction the ego car is traveling, indicating that a complete stop is required.\n\nYellow traffic cones on the right side define a construction zone, signaling a need for vehicles to stay within the lanes available and potentially causing traffic to reduce speed or merge.\n\nFinally, barriers and construction materials are on the road's right side, indicating ongoing construction work. These barriers are a sign of confined road space and could affect the path of the cyclist and other vehicles, thus calling for increased attention.\n\nNo traffic signs or other objects are present in the traffic image."
