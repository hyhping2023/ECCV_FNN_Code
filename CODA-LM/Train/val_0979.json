It could be a truck or a bus, distinguished by its bright headlights. The presence of this large vehicle is significant as it affects the ego car's driving behavior; the ego car needs to adjust its lane positioning and speed control to maintain a safe distance and be ready for potential lane changes due to the size and proximity of the vehicle.\n\nSecondly, there appears to be a vulnerable road user, possibly a pedestrian or a cyclist, crossing the street in front of the approaching vehicle and is visible due to the illumination from the vehicle's headlights. This situation requires the ego car to be vigilant and prepared to either stop or slow down to yield to the vulnerable road user, ensuring their safety and preventing a possible collision.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Trucks are typically used for transporting goods, and due to their size, they require more space for maneuvers such as turning or stopping. The presence of this truck influences the future driving behavior of the ego car by requiring the driver to maintain a safe following distance and to be cautious of potential slow-downs or sudden changes in the truck's speed and direction, ensuring safety and avoiding collisions.",
