A concrete mixer truck on the right side of the intersection, facing forward. Although stationary, its size and position need consideration for maneuvering.\n3. A red truck in the middle distance driving straight through the intersection. This truck is moving away from the ego car's lane but should be monitored.\n4. A sedan in the middle distance, slightly to the right, also driving straight through the intersection. This vehicle is moving in a similar direction as the ego car and should be considered when planning the trajectory.\n\nThere are directional signs above the intersection indicating lanes and directions, aiding in understanding the allowed maneuvers and the proper lane to use.\n\nA green traffic light is visible above the intersection, permitting the ego car to proceed but requiring it to yield to other vehicles already in the intersection.\n\nSeveral traffic cones are placed along the edges of the intersection, demarcating driving lanes and areas under construction to guide the ego car's path.\n\nFinally, on the left side of the intersection, construction cranes and building structures are observed. The ongoing construction suggests that workers or equipment might unexpectedly enter the road, necessitating caution."
