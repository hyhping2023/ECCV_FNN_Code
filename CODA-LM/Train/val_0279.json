This requires the autonomous vehicle to exercise caution and be ready to yield, as the bus's actions could influence the vehicle's decision-making process.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign indicating a height restriction of 4.5 meters attached to a bridge. This information is critical for the autonomous vehicle, especially if it is a tall vehicle like a truck or bus, to ensure it does not exceed the height limit and can safely pass under the bridge.\n\nFurthermore, yellow and black striped warning patterns are present on pillars and barriers around the overpass. These serve as a caution for potential hazards such as sharp turns or narrow lanes. The autonomous vehicle must adjust its speed and positioning accordingly to navigate safely through the underpass.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior."
