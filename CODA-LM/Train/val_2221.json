The vehicle should also have its headlights on, if not already, and use windshield wipers to improve visibility. Additionally, increased following distances from any vehicle ahead will decrease the risk of collision due to slippery surfaces. Checking the vehicle's systems to ensure that all lights and necessary equipment are functioning correctly is also advised before continued driving."
