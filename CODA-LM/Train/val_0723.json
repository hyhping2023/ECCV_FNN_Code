The truck faces the direction in which the ego car is traveling. The presence of the truck may obstruct the path of the ego car, posing a potential hazard that could necessitate a lane change or a reduction in speed to ensure safety. No other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other obstacles are observed in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer. Characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement components, it is typically found on or near construction sites. For the ego car, this indicates the potential presence of construction activity ahead which may result in temporary disruptions like reduced lanes or altered traffic patterns. The ego vehicle might need to reduce speed and exercise heightened caution, possibly following directions from construction signage or personnel directing traffic around the work zone.",
