This vehicle is not in motion but is close to the driving lane, indicating ongoing construction activities and the possible presence of workers. There is a blue informational sign on the right side of the road, positioned before the construction vehicle, which likely provides directions or details about road conditions that inform driving decisions. Additionally, there's blue temporary fencing along the right side of the road, enclosing the construction or work area. This barrier suggests a delimited zone, prompting the need for reduced speed or caution due to potentially narrowed lanes."

The presence of such a vehicle on or near the roadway can significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego car. The driver should maintain alertness and possibly reduce speed, as construction vehicles can be indicators of nearby construction work, temporary obstacles, or unexpected vehicle movements, which require increased caution while driving.",
