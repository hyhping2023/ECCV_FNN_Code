It is equipped with a large rotating drum used to mix cement with water, sand, and gravel to make concrete. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, recognizing this vehicle is crucial as it indicates potential nearby construction sites requiring heightened attention. The presence of such a vehicle can lead to sudden stops or slow-moving traffic as these trucks enter or exit construction sites, and extra caution is advisable to accommodate the unique size and movement patterns of these vehicles.",

Regular checks in the mirrors should be performed to maintain awareness of the surrounding traffic and to find a safe opportunity to overtake the concrete mixer if necessary."
