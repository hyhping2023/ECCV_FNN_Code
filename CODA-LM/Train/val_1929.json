This sign serves as a warning for the priority at the upcoming intersection, suggesting that the ego vehicle should be cautious of potential vehicles that might cross its path.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal guardrails installed along both sides of the road. These guardrails are critical as they delineate the boundary of the road and define the safe driving area for the ego vehicle, ensuring it does not veer off the roadway.\n\nLastly, there is an item of debris, which could be a plastic bag or some other waste material, located on the right lane of the road. This debris is a potential hazard, and the ego vehicle must be vigilant as it could affect tire traction or lead to other unforeseen road hazards, especially if larger objects are involved. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."
