Firstly, we have a silver sedan parked to the right of the ego car, which necessitates that the ego car remains in its current lane without drifting right. Directly ahead and within the same lane, there's a white commercial van that the ego car should follow at a safe distance, being ready to slow down or stop based on the van's movements.\n\nOn the zebra crossing to the right, pedestrians are present and appear to be waiting to cross or actively crossing the street. The ego car must be prepared to yield to them, ensuring their safety and complying with traffic rules. In close proximity to the road, but not within the traffic lane, cyclists are noticed. The ego car should stay alert and be prepared to respond if the cyclists enter its path.\n\nOverhead directional signs provide necessary information for lane selection aligned with the intended direction of the ego car, offering an important navigational aid. There's a traffic light ahead that is green, giving the ego car the right of way. Despite this, vigilance is required to account for other road users who might cross or enter the intersection unexpectedly.\n\nThe scene includes red and white bollards placed at the edge of the pedestrian crossing on the right side of the interaction. These serve the purpose of directing the flow of traffic and preventing vehicles from intruding into the pedestrian zone.\n\nIn this scenario, the JSON data does not mention any traffic cones or other objects present in the image, which indicates their absence in the context of this specific traffic situation. All this information collectively informs the driving behavior of the ego car within the depicted environment."
