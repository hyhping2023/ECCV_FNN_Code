Firstly, there is a three-wheeled vehicle on the right side of the road, aligned parallel to the lane with various items loaded on the back. This vehicle could potentially start moving into the lane of the ego car, or the driver may attempt to unload or access the load, which can affect the traffic flow and safety. Additionally, a silver sedan is parked ahead on the right side, parallel to the lane. The parked car occupies part of the roadside parking area and should be noted in case it starts moving or a door opens into the lane of the ego car.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a person standing next to the three-wheeled vehicle on the sidewalk, facing away from the ego car. The person might move into the street unexpectedly or engage with the load on the vehicle, potentially entering the pathway of the ego car.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, directional road signs are visible above the right lane, indicating a forward or right turn lane ahead. These signs help the ego car to anticipate the road layout and required lane positioning for the desired route.\n\nThere is also a green fence barrier on the right side of the road, indicating construction or a restricted area. While the barrier itself does not pose an immediate threat to the ego car, it signifies closer boundaries on the right side and potential activity nearby that could affect the road situation.\n\nLastly, a silver dustbin is placed on the sidewalk close to the three-wheeled vehicle. The dustbin does not directly influence the ego car but is an object to be aware of in case of any pedestrian movement around it.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or traffic cones present in this image."
