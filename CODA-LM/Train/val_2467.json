Even though the cyclist may affect the lateral clearance, they are not an immediate hazard as they are distancing themselves from the ego vehicle's path.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is noted to be crossing the road ahead of the ego vehicle, transitioning from the left to the right side. This pedestrian has a direct impact on the driving behavior, necessitating that the ego car yields to allow the pedestrian to cross safely.\n\nThe scene is controlled by multiple red traffic lights visible to all lanes, enforcing a stop condition. Thus, the ego car is obliged to halt due to these traffic signals.\n\nOn a sidelight, there are objects presumed to be trash bins or carts located on the right side of the road, with one being maneuvered by the pedestrian. Although these objects do not directly impact driving behavior, they should be closely observed for any potential road hazards or unforeseen movements they may cause."
