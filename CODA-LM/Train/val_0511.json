Their proximity to the traffic lane is a potential risk, as they might inadvertently enter the lane or their work could cause debris to fall onto the road. The ego car must be ready to slow down or stop to ensure safety.\n\nA no parking sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating that parking is not allowed in this area. While this sign does not have an immediate impact on the driving behavior, it does indicate that there are restrictions or regulations in place.\n\nTraffic cones are positioned on the side of the road, signaling a construction area or lane closure. These cones indicate that part of the road or lane may be obstructed or closed, and caution is required while driving past this area.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
