Although it might be stationary or moving slowly due to a traffic light, it is not directly affecting the ego car's path; however, its behavior should be monitored for any unexpected moves. There are also multiple vehicles ahead in the same lane as the ego car with visible brake lights, indicating that the traffic is either slow or halted. These vehicles require the ego car to reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, there is a cyclist riding along the roadside. The cyclist's presence necessitates the ego car to ensure a safe overtaking distance. Additionally, a motorcyclist is moving ahead of the ego car in the center lane, so cautious driving and appropriate following distance are necessary to allow for safe reactions.\n\nAbove the road, there are directional traffic signs on a gantry, which provide information about the road layout ahead and may signal potential lane changes by other drivers. Regarding traffic lights, the one directly ahead of the ego car is green, suggesting the ego car can proceed, but with caution, as other vehicles or the traffic light might change. Also, a pedestrian traffic light on the right indicates a green figure, allowing pedestrians to cross, although none are visible at the moment; the ego car must stay vigilant for any potential crossers.\n\nAlong the right edge of the road, there's a line of red and white traffic cones that likely indicate road construction or lane alterations. This requires the ego car to stay within the lane boundaries and not to attempt passing on the right. There are no barriers or other objects described that affect the driving conditions in the current traffic scenario."

Regular checks for any pedestrians who may start crossing based on the pedestrian light being green should be conducted. Finally, the vehicle should remain in its current lane, respecting the demarcation set by the traffic cones and not attempt any right-side maneuvers."
