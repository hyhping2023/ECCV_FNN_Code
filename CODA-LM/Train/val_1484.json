        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are a couple of vehicles and some debris observed on the road. \n\nFirstly, there is a large green dump truck on the left side, which is in its own lane but quite close to the lane divider and facing the oncoming traffic. The significant size of the dump truck and its proximity to the lane divider could pose a challenge for the ego vehicle by reducing the maneuverable space available on the road, making it potentially difficult to overtake safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a flatbed truck carrying a substantial piece of construction machinery. This vehicle is located towards the center-right of the image, well-positioned in its lane, and oriented in the same direction as the ego vehicle. It's noteworthy that the truck might be either moving slowly or stopped. Consequently, the ego vehicle might need to decelerate or perform a lane change to keep a safe distance, avoiding any risk that could come from the truck's reduced speed or immobility.\n\nLastly, on the roadside, there is noticeable construction debris and dirt piles. Some of these materials have encroached upon the edge of the driving lane. These objects pose a potential hazard as they might obstruct part of the driving lane, demanding the ego vehicle to proceed with caution, possibly at a reduced speed, in order to avoid any risks associated with these obstructions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, identified by its robust structure and function-specific build. Typically, such vehicles are equipped to perform tasks related to construction or industrial purposes, resembling characteristics like a flatbed to carry heavy materials and industrial machinery. In a driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle could indicate ongoing construction or maintenance work nearby. This characteristic suggests that the ego car should maintain a cautious approach, perhaps ready to respond to sudden stops or slower traffic. Awareness of potential road debris or workers in the vicinity is also crucial for maintaining safe driving conditions.",

Overtaking should be done with care and only if the adjacent lane is clear and it is safe to do so. Monitoring the road for any further hazards that might come into view is also advised."
