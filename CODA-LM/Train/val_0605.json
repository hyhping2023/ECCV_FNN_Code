However, there are vulnerable road users, including a cyclist to the right of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. The presence of the cyclist requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to adjust, as cyclists can be unpredictable. Additionally, pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the left, with one pedestrian carrying an umbrella and crossing the road. The ego car must exercise caution as pedestrians near the road may enter the driving path unexpectedly, especially the one crossing the road.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a no-horn sign visible above the traffic lights ahead, indicating that the ego car should not use the horn in this area. Also, a no left turn sign is installed on a pole on the right side of the road, with a directional sign below it indicating straight ahead. This informs the ego car that it should not turn left at the intersection and should proceed straight if that's the intended route.\n\nThe traffic lights are situated ahead of the intersection, but their state is not clear from the image. Consequently, the ego car must approach the intersection with caution and be prepared to stop or proceed based on the actual traffic light state when it becomes visible.\n\nThere are barriers in the form of fenced off areas on both sides of the road, which appear to restrict pedestrian access to the roadway. These barriers narrow the area of pedestrian activity, potentially decreasing the risk of pedestrians stepping onto the road unexpectedly in these areas.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects present in the image."
