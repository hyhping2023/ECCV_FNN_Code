Traffic cones are often orange, enhanced with a reflective strip to make them more visible during nighttime or in low-light conditions. They are used to mark areas where traffic may need to be redirected due to construction, a roadblock, or other temporary changes. For the ego car, encountering this cone means there might be construction or some hazard ahead on the road, necessitating a potential reduction in speed or a change in direction to navigate safely around the obstacle.",

Bollards are used to ensure safety by keeping cars within road boundaries and can be reflective or non-reflective depending on their location and purpose. The presence of a bollard in this scenario suggests that the ego car may need to maintain a safe distance to avoid a collision, especially in narrow driving paths.",

Barriers can be found in various materials, including metal, plastic, or wood, and are often movable to allow for temporary access control. In this driving scenario, the presence of a barrier indicates that there is a restricted area or a checkpoint that may require the ego car to stop or proceed only when permitted, perhaps waiting for the barrier to be opened or finding an alternative route as dictated by traffic signs or personnel.",
