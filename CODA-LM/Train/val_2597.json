This indicates that the ego vehicle is permitted to proceed straight ahead legally and without obstruction. Additionally, there is a yellow and black striped barrier with a sign positioned in front of the traffic signal. The presence of this barrier suggests that there is some form of work or obstruction on the road, and it serves as a warning for vehicles to either slow down or be prepared to stop or detour. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a multi-tiered traffic light featuring multiple circular green signals lit simultaneously. Such traffic lights are crucial for controlling vehicle movement through intersections by providing clear visual cues. The green lights indicate that vehicles approaching the light, including the ego car, have the right of way to proceed forward or to make turns depending on designated lane signals if present. The future driving behavior of the ego car, upon observing this green light, would likely be to continue moving forward without stopping, ensuring a smooth traffic flow at the intersection.",

However, due to the presence of a barrier and potential road works ahead, the vehicle should maintain a cautious speed and be prepared to follow any additional signs or changes in the road layout. It should also be ready to adjust to changing road conditions due to the possible presence of icy patches."
