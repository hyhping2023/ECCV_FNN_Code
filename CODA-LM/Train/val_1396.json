While this vehicle is stationary and does not immediately influence the current driving scenario, its position could become a potential hazard if it were to enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple yellow directional signs on the right side of the road, which are essential for the ego vehicle to observe. These signs are there to communicate any changes in the road layout or provide necessary directional information to ensure the ego vehicle navigates effectively through the traffic environment.\n\nMoreover, yellow and black temporary barriers are present, obstructing access to a portion of the road on the left. These barriers likely denote ongoing construction or a road closure, mandating that the ego vehicle maintain its course in the open right-hand lane to avoid the restricted area. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects indicated in this scenario that impact the driving conditions for the ego vehicle."
