Its lifting mechanism is visible, and it is not carrying any load. This proximate presence of the forklift partially occupies the lane of the ego vehicle and may behave unpredictably, affecting the driving decisions of the ego vehicle.\n\nStraight ahead, there is a set of traffic lights, which are currently green for vehicles that are going straight. This green light indicates that the ego vehicle is allowed to proceed, as long as the lane ahead is clear and consideration is taken for the current road users as well as any potential obstructions.\n\nThere are also temporary green barriers with a blue tarp on the right side of the road, suggesting an area of roadwork or a lane closure. The presence of these barriers serves as a warning that there could be construction activity or workers nearby, and hence, the ego vehicle should navigate this section with increased caution."

Forklifts are typically used in construction and manufacturing environments for moving large or heavy materials over short distances. The presence of a forklift on the road suggests that there may be nearby construction or loading activities. For the ego vehicle, this means it should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance and being aware of potential movements of the forklift or sudden stops. It also indicates the possibility of construction workers or other vehicles around that might enter the traffic flow unexpectedly.",
