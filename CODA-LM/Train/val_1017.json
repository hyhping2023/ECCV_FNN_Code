Due to the truck's size and its potentially shifting cargo, a greater following distance is advised to react to any unexpected stops or debris falling from the trailer.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue informational traffic sign above the road, positioned to the right, indicating the presence of service facilities such as fuel, food, or rest areas ahead. While this sign does not directly affect driving behavior, it serves to inform drivers of potential exits or service opportunities approaching.\n\nFinally, the road is marked by multiple traffic cones along the right edge, demarcating the boundary of the driving lane. These cones likely indicate the presence of roadwork or hazards off the lane and signal drivers to maintain their position in the lane, keeping to the left and avoiding any movement towards the edge of the road."
