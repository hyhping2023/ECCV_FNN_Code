This vehicle's movements will directly influence the driving decisions of the ego car as it is directly in its path. Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked on the right side of the road, some with their brake lights on. These parked vehicles might potentially move or open a door suddenly, posing a hazard that the ego car needs to be prepared for.\n\nThere is also a cyclist in the bicycle lane, traveling parallel to the ego car. The proximity of the cyclist to the ego car's travel lane necessitates careful lane choice and possibly evasive maneuvers to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, warning signs indicating a pedestrian crosswalk ahead are present on the right side of the road. This signals to the ego car that it should be ready to stop or slow down for pedestrians who might be crossing or about to cross the street."
