Firstly, a car to the left with its headlights on is preparing either to merge into the traffic or cross the street. Extra caution is necessary as this vehicle might enter the lane of the ego vehicle. Secondly, there are several parked cars on both sides of the street, which could potentially become obstructions. There's a risk that a car door may open suddenly or a pedestrian could appear unexpectedly from between these parked cars.\n\nThe categories covering vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects such as debris or dustbins, all indicate that there are no such entities present in the field of view or that they are not clearly visible in the image. Consequently, no immediate actions or adjustments to driving behavior are required based on these elements in the current scenario. It is suggested to maintain general caution due to the lack of visibility regarding traffic signs and traffic lights."
