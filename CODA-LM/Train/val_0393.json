        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a white car directly in front of the ego car, positioned centrally in the lane and ready to move forward. This vehicle is crucial as it determines the following distance and speed at which the ego car should travel. Additionally, multiple vehicles are observed across the lanes ahead, including a white van in the leftmost lane and a dark-colored car in the rightmost lane at a further distance. The behavior of these vehicles will influence the lane choice and speed of the ego car.\n\nTo the immediate right and slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a motorcyclist sharing the same lane. The presence of the motorcyclist is significant due to their vulnerability, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for any sudden changes in the motorcyclist's trajectory or speed.\n\nOverhead, there is a directional sign indicating that the leftmost lane is for turning left, the center two lanes are for going straight, and the rightmost lane can be used for turning right or proceeding straight. This sign is vital for the ego car to select the appropriate lane based on its intended route.\n\nThe traffic lights in view display a red light for lanes designated for going straight and a green arrow for turning left. The ego car must stop if it is in a lane meant for moving straight and can only proceed if it is in the lane for turning left.\n\nOn the right side of the road, traffic cones are set up, signaling an area that may require caution or indicate roadwork. These cones suggest that there could be potential hazards or changes in road conditions, and they instruct the ego car to stay in its lane and keep a safe distance from the cones.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects mentioned in the scene."

Avoid lane changes near the cones unless necessary for a route change. Monitor the surrounding traffic for any sudden stops or changes."
