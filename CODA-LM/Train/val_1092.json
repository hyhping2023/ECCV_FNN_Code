These vehicles reduce the available width of the right lane and could potentially obscure pedestrians or other hazards that may emerge from between them. There is also a yellow traffic sign indicating a parking area on the right side of the road; however, additional text on the sign is unclear due to the image quality. The sign suggests the possibility of an area with high vehicle turnover, which could lead to vehicles entering or exiting parking spots. Furthermore, two traffic cones are placed in the center of the right lane ahead on the road, signaling some sort of road obstruction or maintenance and requiring the driver to change lanes or adjust speed as necessary."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, an often cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. Typically colored in vivid shades like orange, yellow or red with reflective strips to maximize its visibility during night or adverse weather conditions, this cone guides vehicles by indicating areas that are off-limits or by delineating lanes during road works or accidents. The presence of this traffic cone suggests there may be potential hazards or alterations in the driving path ahead, such as construction activities, a car accident, or other obstructions. It is crucial for the ego car to decrease speed and proceed with enhanced caution, maintaining a safe distance from the cone to avoid any physical contact with it.",

It is generally bright in color, often orange, with reflective bands to enhance visibility during nighttime or low-light conditions. The presence of a traffic cone in the driving scenario suggests that there might be hazards ahead such as road works, an accident, or other obstructions. This cone requires drivers to remain alert and potentially prepare to slow down or maneuver cautiously, respecting the changed traffic conditions this cone indicates.",
