        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a flatbed truck with a white cab, and grey flatbed stopped ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane. The truck is carrying pipes, and its brake lights are on, suggesting a possible obstruction, road work, or heavy traffic ahead, which could affect the ego vehicle's speed, requiring it to stop or change lanes.\n\nThere are also two traffic signs in view. One is a blue rectangular sign hanging above the right side of the roadway, pointing toward an upcoming service area or rest stop, which provides helpful facility information but does not immediately affect driving decisions. The other sign is a yellow warning sign to the left of the road with Chinese characters, likely indicating the need for caution ahead due to potential road conditions or construction work, which means the ego vehicle should reduce speed and proceed carefully.\n\nIn terms of traffic directing tools, there are multiple orange and white traffic cones placed diagonally across the lane to the left, indicating a lane closure and directing traffic to merge to the right. Therefore, the ego vehicle needs to be prepared to change lanes as directed by these cones.\n\nFurthermore, there is a barrier with red and white stripes on the left side of the road, hinting at closed lanes or the pathway that traffic should follow. This necessitates that the ego vehicle slows down and complies with the traffic pattern established by the traffic cones and barriers.\n\nLastly, an electronic signboard mounted on a pole to the left side of the road, which includes a blue solar panel on top, likely shows traffic information. This signboard might display changing traffic conditions, such as road works or detours, and thus the ego car should remain alert to adjust its route or driving approach accordingly."
