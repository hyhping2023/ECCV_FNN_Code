A large construction vehicle with an extended crane arm is occupying the right lane. This vehicle may slow down or stop suddenly due to construction work.\n2. A red cargo truck is driving in the left lane ahead of the ego car. The truck's large size may obstruct the view of the road ahead for the ego car and may also have a longer stopping distance.\n3. Another truck is visible in the right lane next to the construction vehicle. The proximity of this truck to the construction vehicle could lead to potential merging into the left lane, creating a hazard for the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic sign:\n- A blue informational sign on the right side indicates an exit or interchange ahead. This suggests the presence of an upcoming decision point where vehicles may be changing lanes or exiting.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier:\n- A concrete median barrier separates the opposing traffic lanes. This barrier restricts the ability to make emergency maneuvers across the median.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."

Monitor the red cargo truck ahead and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if it changes its driving behavior. Additionally, be attentive to the surroundings for any vehicles that may enter the roadway from the upcoming exit or interchange. Due to the presence of barriers, lane-changing options to the right are limited, so any maneuvers should be made with increased caution and awareness of the large vehicles' presence."
