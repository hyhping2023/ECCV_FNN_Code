This vehicle occupies the majority of the lane ahead and partially obstructs the view of the road. It appears to be stationary and engaged in construction or maintenance work. This vehicle poses a safety concern as it might block or restrict the traffic flow, requiring the ego car to navigate around it cautiously or wait until it is safe to pass.\n\nAdditionally, there are trees and foliage alongside the road, but they are not encroaching on the road. There are no other objects, such as debris, dustbins, or roadwork signs, that would impede the navigation of the ego car. This lack of additional road-hindering objects allows the ego car to focus solely on navigating around the stationary industrial vehicle."

This type of machinery often features an articulated arm or boom, hydraulic mechanisms, and a cabin for the operator. The presence of such a vehicle in the driving scenario indicates active construction work in the area. For the ego car, this means possible delays and the need for heightened awareness and reduced speed to safely navigate around potential obstacles or changing road conditions caused by the construction work.",

If it is not possible to safely pass, the car should remain stationary until the road is clear. The use of indicators (turn signals) and adherence to road rules when navigating around the obstruction should be considered."
