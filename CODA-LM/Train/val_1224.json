        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are a few notable road users and signals that the ego vehicle must consider:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A white bus is positioned ahead within the left lane, its front facing towards the ego vehicle, though only partly visible. This indicates that the bus may begin moving once the traffic light switches, potentially influencing the ego vehicle's choice in lane selection and speed adjustments.\n2. Additionally, a white car is situated in the right lane, directly ahead of the ego vehicle and oriented in the same direction. The behavior of this car is important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and regulate its speed accordingly.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. There's a cyclist directly in the path of the ego vehicle, sharing the same lane and facing the same direction. The ego vehicle must exercise caution and increase the following distance to ensure the cyclist's safety.\n2. On the left side, a motorcyclist is getting ready to cross the intersection and is positioned such that it faces across the path of the ego vehicle. It's crucial for the ego vehicle to be prepared to yield and potentially alter its speed or direction to avoid the motorcyclist.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. The traffic signal located ahead is currently red for the lane occupied by both the ego vehicle and the bus. This means the ego vehicle is required to stay stationary until the light turns green.\n2. There is also another red traffic signal for those traveling on the crossroad, indicating that the traffic perpendicular to the ego vehicle is also at a halt. Awareness of the perpendicular traffic signals can aid in predicting the movement of cross traffic when the lights switch.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

As this vehicle is considerably larger and heavier than typical cars, it demands extra caution from drivers around it.

Due to wet road conditions, the vehicle should proceed with reduced speed and be prepared for longer stopping distances once the light turns green."
