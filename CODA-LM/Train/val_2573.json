Vehicles:\n   - A blue SUV is positioned on the right side of the ego car, both traveling in the same direction. This vehicle could impact the ego car's ability to perform lane change maneuvers.\n   - An oncoming truck is in the opposite lane, distinguishable by its red load. Given its size, the ego car must exercise additional caution when passing.\n   - A motorcycle is ahead in the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Due to the motorcycle's ability to change speed and direction quickly, the ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance.\n\n2. Traffic Lights:\n   - There are traffic lights ahead, with one designated for each lane. Currently, their status is not visible. The ego car will need to respond accordingly once the state of the traffic lights is clear, which could involve stopping, slowing down, or continuing to move forward.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Given its bulky size and potential slow speed, it influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and potentially causing a slowdown in traffic flow. The ego car may need to maintain a greater following distance or consider a lane change to avoid being too close to such a large vehicle, which could abruptly stop or decrease speed to perform construction-related tasks.",
