Directly in front of the ego car is a dark-colored SUV with its brake lights on, indicating it is either slowing down or stopped. This vehicle directly affects the ego car by necessitating adjustments to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAhead to the right, there is a directional sign indicating upcoming route options, requiring potential lane changes to follow a desired path. Additionally, a red traffic light is visible ahead, controlling the intersection, which means the ego car must prepare to stop if the light remains red upon approach.\n\nOn the left side of the ego car, there are orange traffic cones, suggesting possible roadwork or areas to avoid, signaling the ego car to stay in the current lane or shift to the right if necessary. Furthermore, a row of parked bicycles is present on the right side of the road behind a barrier, which, while not currently affecting road conditions, warrants monitoring in case a pedestrian moves towards them."
