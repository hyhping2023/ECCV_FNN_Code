        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene ahead, there is a silver SUV positioned directly in front of the ego car with its brake lights on, indicating that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. This requires the ego car to keep a safe distance and be ready to halt if needed. Additionally, several other vehicles in nearby lanes are also stopped, as suggested by their illuminated tail lights, signaling that there may be heavy traffic or a traffic control device prompting the vehicles to remain stationary. This situation necessitates the ego car to drive carefully.\n\nTo the right side of the road, there is a group of pedestrians and cyclists gathered just behind some temporary barriers. It seems like they are waiting for the opportunity to cross the street. The presence of these vulnerable road users means that the ego car must be prepared for the potential of them stepping onto the roadway, requiring an immediate response to ensure their safety.\n\nOverhead, there is a traffic light glowing red, though it is partially obscured from the ego car's view. This red light signifies that traffic is currently required to stop, and thus the ego car should remain stationary until it turns green.\n\nAlong the same side of the road as the pedestrians and cyclists, traffic cones are laid out to create a barricade between the driving lane and the sidewalk. The positioning of these cones likely indicates roadwork or a designated pedestrian area that the ego car should not cross into.\n\nFurthermore, there are temporary fences or barriers that delineate the boundary between the road and the sidewalk on the right-hand side. These structures serve to keep pedestrians and cyclists separate from vehicle traffic, enhancing safety for all parties involved.\n\nAll other categories including traffic signs and other objects have returned empty results, suggesting there are no such relevant road users or objects currently in the scene."
