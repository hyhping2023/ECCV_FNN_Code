The cyclist appears to be engaged in a stationary transaction or discussion with a second person close by. Although they are currently not in motion, there's a risk that their activities may unpredictably lead them to move into the path of our vehicle or other traffic.\n\nDirectly ahead, on the right side, we observe a red traffic light commanding us to halt. We are required to remain stationary until the traffic light turns green to proceed safely.\n\nMoreover, we note a heap of debris scattered across the road in the lane right of our car. The origin of the debris may be connected to the cyclist's cart or other sources. This represents an obstruction which could disrupt the normal flow of traffic, potentially necessitating our vehicle and others to deftly maneuver around it.\n\nIt is essential to note that while vehicles, traffic cones, and barriers are common on roadways, they are noticeably absent in this particular scene."
