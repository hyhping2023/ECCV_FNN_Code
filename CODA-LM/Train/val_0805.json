This dog is found walking along the right edge of the road and is facing away from the ego vehicle. The presence of the dog is significant as it introduces unpredictability into the driving scenario. Dogs can change direction without warning, and there's a potential risk that it may enter the road. This could pose a hazard to the vehicle's driving path, necessitating caution and readiness to adapt driving behavior accordingly. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that impact driving behavior."
