The motorcycle is distinctive, with a significant amount of reflective material or lights that indicate it might be a delivery bike or used for a similar purpose. Given the close distance to the ego vehicle, it is necessary to continually monitor the motorcycle's speed and distance to prevent any potential collision.\n\nAt the same time, there is a traffic light ahead displaying green, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed. However, the driver must stay cautious in case the light changes to yellow or red and also pay close attention to the motorcycle's behavior in response to the traffic light.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones positioned on the right side of the road, indicating roadwork or an obstruction of some sort. This setup signals that there could be a reduction in the drivable width of the lane, which would require the ego vehicle to adjust its lateral position on the road to maintain a safe buffer zone around the work area.\n\nThe scene is clear of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, and devoid of any traffic signs, barriers, or other objects that affect driving behavior."

Furthermore, the wet road conditions require cautious driving to ensure safe stopping distances. Being aware that the green light may change, the driver should be prepared to stop if needed, especially considering the potential reduced visibility and reaction time at night."
