The truck's size and partial encroachment can impact lane availability and the ego car's ability to maintain a safe following distance or perform a lane change. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles ahead in the same lane as the ego car, including at least one white sedan. These vehicles dictate the speed and flow of traffic for the ego car, necessitating reactions to sudden braking or changes in speed.\n\nDirectional signs are overhead on the right side, indicating lanes and possible exits, providing critical route information for potential lane changes or upcoming exits for the ego car. Further ahead, a traffic light displaying red at the intersection instructs that the vehicles in front, including the ego car, should be prepared to stop."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a crane mounted on a truck. It features a heavy-duty frame, multiple axles to support its weight, and a substantial, articulated crane extension. Such vehicles are commonly used in building and infrastructure construction projects for lifting large and heavy materials. In terms of influence on driving behavior, the ego car needs to maintain a safe distance from this large vehicle. Due to its size and weight, the construction vehicle may have longer stopping distances, limited maneuverability, and could obscure the drivers view of smaller vehicles and road signs, which necessitates increased caution and readiness to slow down or stop.",
