The road features a line of parked cars on the right curb, which reduces the drivable road width and presents a potential hazard of hidden pedestrians. An adjacent lane on the left contains a large yellow construction truck that might cause nearby traffic to merge into the ego car's lane, urging the need for caution and speed regulation for safe merges. \n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian stands near the parked cars, engaging in non-traffic activities. Although not on the road, they might step onto it, and thus the ego car should keep a watchful eye for any indication of them entering the roadway. The traffic light ahead shows green, permitting the ego car to continue, provided it remains alert to signal changes and the right of way. \n\nThere are orange traffic cones indicating possible road work or a lane closure that may require the ego car to slow down or change lanes. Concrete barriers accompany the parked cars, highlighting a construction zone or a sectioned-off area, signaling the ego car to be aware of deviations in standard traffic flow, watch for signs, and potential obstructions. \n\nGiven this environment, the autonomous driving system must navigate with care, considering the potential for hidden pedestrians, traffic merging, signal changes, construction work, and changes in normal traffic patterns. Traffic signs and other miscellaneous objects are not present in this particular image."

Maintaining a greater following distance due to the wet road conditions will allow a safer stopping distance if needed."
