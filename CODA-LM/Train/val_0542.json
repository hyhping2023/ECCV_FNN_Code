Additionally, there is a round blue traffic sign with a white arrow pointing right, which is a mandatory direction sign at the toll booth. This sign directs vehicles to move to the right, and the ego car must adhere to this instruction to navigate correctly through the toll plaza.\n\nFurthermore, a green traffic light is visible above the toll booth lane that the van is using, indicating that vehicles are allowed to proceed. This signal informs the ego car that it can continue moving forward when it is safe. Along the left edge of the lane, orange traffic cones are placed to mark the boundary of the toll booth lane. These cones serve to prevent driving outside the designated lane and assist in guiding the vehicle through the correct path.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
