The driver should be vigilant for potential actions from the pedestrians, such as sudden movements or changes in crossing speed. The parked cars on both sides require cautious navigation to ensure a safe distance is maintained. Avoidance of the scattered debris in the road should also be considered to prevent damage to the vehicle. Overall, maintain a low speed and high alertness until the pedestrians have cleared the road and the path is confirmed to be safe to proceed."
