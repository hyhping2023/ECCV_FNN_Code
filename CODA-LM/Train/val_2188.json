These vehicles are dark in color and have their tail lights off, which indicates that they are stationary and likely unoccupied. The presence of these parked cars is significant as it reduces the available space for the ego car to navigate, necessitating careful driving maneuvers to safely proceed along the road. There are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists visible in the scene, allowing the driver to concentrate on the vehicular obstacles without the added concern of ensuring the safety of these road users. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, which means these elements do not impact the driving behavior in the current context."

The presence of a parked car at night also increases the need for the ego car driver to be vigilant for any sudden movements, such as doors opening or pedestrians emerging from behind the parked car.",

It is parked potentially with its front towards the street. This car influences the driving behavior of the ego car by restricting the available width of the roadway that can be used for driving, potentially leading to the need for the ego car to slow down or maneuver carefully to avoid getting too close or colliding with the parked car.",

Use headlights if not already on to improve visibility."
