        "description and explanation": "In the scene observed, there is a cement mixer truck occupying the right lane and moving ahead of the autonomous vehicle. The presence of the truck is significant because its size and position could potentially obscure the autonomous car's view of the road conditions ahead. This can make it challenging for the car to execute safe maneuvers, such as passing the truck or changing lanes. Additionally, due to the nature of the truckâ€™s operations, there is a risk it might make unexpected stops or turns, which could affect the overall flow of traffic that the autonomous vehicle needs to navigate through. No other road users or traffic control devices are present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer. It is a large, heavy-duty vehicle used for mixing and transporting concrete to construction sites. In the driving scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle influences the ego car's behavior by signaling potential nearby construction activities. The ego car should exercise caution, reducing speed and being prepared for sudden stops or detours, as construction vehicles often indicate active work zones with increased hazards and changes in traffic patterns.",
