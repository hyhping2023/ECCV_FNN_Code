This vehicle's presence is critical as its speed and position on the road directly affect the ego car's driving decisions. Specifically, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and possibly adjust its speed and lane position to accommodate the sedan's movements.\n\nAs for the road's signs, a speed limit sign is visible, indicating a maximum allowed speed of 40 kilometers per hour. This sign is important as it dictates the speed at which the ego car must travel, ensuring it adheres to legal speed limits and maintains safe driving conditions.\n\nAlong the edge of the road, an orange traffic cone is placed on the right side near the sidewalk, signaling a potential hazard or serving as a boundary warning. This cone necessitates the ego car to steer clear of it, thereby avoiding any potential collisions that could occur from straying too close to the cone's location.\n\nA white and blue metal barrier is present to separate the lanes, which is crucial for keeping the traffic organized and preventing vehicles from accidentally shifting into the wrong lane. This barrier requires the ego car to recognize lane divisions and stay in the correct lane, enhancing the safety of all road users.\n\nThe scene does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects that would otherwise require additional actions or considerations from the ego car."
