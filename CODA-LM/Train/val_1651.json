        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a large commercial concrete mixer truck positioned directly in front of the ego car. Notably, its brake lights and rear hazard lights are engaged, indicating that it is stationary. This is an important consideration for the ego car, as the truck's presence and the illuminated brake lights suggest it has come to a stop at the intersection, most likely in response to the traffic signals. Consequently, this hampers the ego car's ability to proceed.\n\nFurthermore, to the left side of the ego car, there is a traffic sign signaling that a lane merge is aheadâ€”transitioning from two lanes to one. This sign informs the driver of the ego car to anticipate a narrowing of the drivable space and to be ready for potential merging maneuvers with other traffic. On the right side of the road exists a pedestrian crossing sign. It serves as a caution for the ego car to remain vigilant for pedestrians who might be intending to cross the roadway in the nearby vicinity.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light situated directly in front of the ego car is displaying a red signal. This is a clear directive for the ego car to stay in position until such time the light changes to green, permitting further travel.\n\nLastly, there are yellow bollards aligned with the lane separator's edge, contributing to the organization of traffic flow. These bollards perform as a component of the physical barrier scheme to distinctly divide traffic lanes and could also be present to steer traffic in response to the impending lane merge scenario previously indicated by the road signage."
