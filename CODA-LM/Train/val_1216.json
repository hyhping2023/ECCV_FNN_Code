        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two notable categories of road elements. The first includes a traffic sign that is blue and rectangular, displaying a symbol for a parking area, accompanied by a nearby circular sign indicating a speed limit of 5 km/h. These signs are positioned on the right side of the road, primarily to guide the ego car to recognize the proximity of a parking area and to enforce a speed limit which must be adhered to for both safety and legal compliance.\n\nThe second category encompasses multiple traffic cones that are orange and white, strategically placed around construction materials or debris, also located on the right side of the road. These cones serve the purpose of signaling a road hazard or construction zone. They play a crucial role in reducing the available lane width, thereby directly influencing the driving path of the ego car. This configuration necessitates cautious navigation and potential adjustment in the driving path by the autonomous driving system to ensure safety."

It appears to be a collection of miscellaneous materials such as bags, fabrics, possibly some construction-related materials or sandbags laid out on the side of the road. Such obstructions on or near the driving lane pose potential hazards; they could either obstruct visual clarity or physical movement, compelling drivers to potentially navigate around them, thereby increasing the risk for accidents or driving inefficiencies.
