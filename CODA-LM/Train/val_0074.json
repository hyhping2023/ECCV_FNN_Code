The truck is notably large, has a visible license plate, and seems to be carrying cargo. The presence and size of the truck are significant as they may limit the ego car's visibility and restrict the space available for maneuvering.\n\nAdditionally, there is an overhead traffic sign on the right side indicating an upcoming lane merge from the right, signaling that the number of lanes will decrease ahead. This sign alerts the ego car to be ready for merging traffic and possible obstructions as the lanes converge.\n\nIn the distance, a traffic light displaying a red signal can be seen. This red light requires the ego car to come to a complete stop and wait for the light to change to green before it can continue on its path safely.\n\nOn the right side of the road, orange traffic cones are set up, guiding the traffic to shift to the left. These cones suggest that there is construction or a roadblock ahead, and as a result, the ego car will need to change lanes to the left.\n\nCorresponding to the placement of the traffic cones, temporary barriers are also present on the right side of the road, indicating that part of the road is not accessible. These barriers act as a physical demarcation, making it clear that the ego car must merge to the left since proceeding in the current lane is not an option."

It is also vital to keep a safe following distance from the truck ahead."
