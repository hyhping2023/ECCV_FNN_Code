        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large white cement mixer truck in the right lane, which is noticeable due to its rotating drum, chute, ladder, and identification numbers. The truck's size and its partial obstruction of the lane necessitate careful driving from the ego car, which may need to slow down or change lanes to navigate safely around the truck. Additionally, the driving environment is bordered by a wall on the left and a fenced area on the right, with industrial or construction-like structures visible in the background. These boundaries restrict the driving space and maneuverability for the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a vertical ladder attached to the back of a cement mixer truck. The ladder allows operators to access higher parts of the vehicle for operational tasks such as cleaning the mixer drum, inspection, or maintenance. In driving, its visibility indicates to other drivers the potential for operators to be entering or exiting the truck at various stops, suggesting a need for increased caution when approaching from behind.",

If the lane to the left is clear and it is safe and legal to do so, the ego car may consider changing lanes to avoid driving too close to the cement mixer truck. It is important to use turn signals well in advance and check blind spots before executing the lane change."
