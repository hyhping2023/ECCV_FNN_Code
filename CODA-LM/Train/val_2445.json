Additionally, there is a toll booth barrier arm with red and white stripes that is in the upright position, signaling that vehicles, including the ego car, can proceed without any hindrance. On the right side of the road, there is a series of orange traffic cones arranged in a row. These cones are demarcating a construction or restricted area, effectively narrowing the driveable space and guiding the ego car to stay within the designated lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."

The traffic cones indicate a clear path that should be followed, staying within the lane boundaries to avoid entering the restricted area."
