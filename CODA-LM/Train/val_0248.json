A white sedan is positioned slightly ahead on the left side of the ego car with no turn signals on. This vehicle could potentially change lanes or slow down, thereby affecting the ego vehicle's path and speed.\n2. A green hatchback directly in front of the ego car is stopped and displaying brake lights. This indicates that the vehicle is either slowing down or stopped, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance or prepare to stop.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there is:\nA cyclist on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist needs extra attention as they are more vulnerable and could change their path, impacting the ego car's driving decisions.\n\nThere are two traffic signs:\n1. A yellow diamond-shaped sign with a black symbol indicating a crossing for school children is located on the right side of the road ahead. This sign advises the driver to be cautious and watch out for children crossing, which would affect the car's speed and alertness in this area.\n2. A 'No Parking' sign is on the right, indicating that parking is not allowed from this point forward. This sign is primarily informational and doesn't immediately affect driving behavior unless the ego car is looking for parking.\n\nThere is one traffic light:\nA traffic light ahead shows red above the green hatchback. The red light necessitates that the ego vehicle stops and waits for the light to change to green before proceeding.\n\nThere are traffic cones:\nAn array of red and white traffic cones is on the right side of the road, indicating a closed lane or construction area. These cones suggest that there might be road work ahead, and the ego vehicle should remain in its current lane and not attempt to merge right.\n\nNo barriers or other objects are present in the image."
