The sheer size and potential slow speed of this truck can affect traffic flow and may require lane changes for faster traffic. Additionally, various cars are observed in the left and right lanes, also driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle; their presence demands careful attention for safe lane changes and to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right sidewalk parallel to the road, there is a pedestrian walking. While the pedestrian is not on the roadway, their presence should still be noted in case they decide to cross unexpectedly.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is located on the right side of the road, indicating a pedestrian crosswalk nearby, which suggests the need for heightened alertness for potential crossing pedestrians.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are arranged in a line, separating the lanes of traffic and indicating a closed or merging lane ahead. This signals a change in road layout and potentially necessitates lane changes or navigating merging traffic for the ego vehicle."
