        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a significant presence that demands attention - a garbage truck is identified traveling in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle (referred to as the ego car). The significance of the garbage truck's presence is twofold. Firstly, it necessitates the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance to ensure safety. This precaution is imperative as it accounts for the potential unpredictability of the garbage truck's actions, including possible sudden stops or unexpected lane changes that might occur during its route. These considerations are essential for adapting the driving behavior of the ego car to the dynamic road situation, highlighting the importance of situational awareness in autonomous driving systems."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle, likely used for heavy-duty tasks such as roadwork or hauling materials. Its presence on the road indicates that there could be ongoing construction or road maintenance nearby. For the ego car, this means increased caution is needed while driving. The vehicle may move slowly or stop suddenly, and there could be workers nearby. Adjustments in driving speed and awareness are essential to safely navigate past this construction vehicle and any potential associated roadwork.",
