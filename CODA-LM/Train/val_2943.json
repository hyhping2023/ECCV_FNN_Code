This parked vehicle may obstruct the view or path of the ego car, and therefore the ego car needs to proceed with caution and might need to change lanes to avoid it. Additionally, a person on a bicycle is present on the road. Given that cyclists are vulnerable road users, it is important for the ego car to give them ample space and be cautious not to pose a threat to their safety.\n\nAlso visible in the distance is a traffic light displaying a red light. The red light requires that the ego car must stop completely at the intersection until it is safe to proceed. On the side of the road, there are barriers or railings which suggest there might be a construction or work zone nearby, alerting the ego car to exercise additional caution and potentially requiring lane changes to navigate past the area safely.\n\nFurthermore, there is a large billboard or advertisement on the side of a building within the scene. While the billboard does not directly affect driving behavior, it may act as a landmark or point of reference for the ego car's navigation system."

The driver should monitor the dog's movements carefully as it might unexpectedly enter the roadway, necessitating a sudden need to slow down or stop to avoid an accident, thereby ensuring the safety of the dog and preventing damage to the vehicle or harm to other road users.",
