Additionally, a blue truck is parked further ahead on the right side of the road, and various other parked or stationary vehicles are present on both sides of the street. These elements could impact the driving behavior of the ego car, as the white car's ambiguous positioning suggests an intention to turn or pull over, which may require the ego car to adjust its lane or proceed with caution. The parked truck narrows the drivable space in the lane ahead, calling for extra vigilance.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users in the scene. Pedestrians are present, including a group walking parallel to the ego car on the left side of the road and an individual on a motorcycle parked on the sidewalk facing the road on the right side. The proximity of pedestrians to the road edge poses a risk of someone stepping into the path of the ego car. Additionally, the motorcyclist's orientation might indicate a potential intention to enter the roadway, necessitating caution.\n\nLastly, there is a blue dumpster on the right edge of the road that could obstruct part of the lane or distract drivers. Other road users might attempt to avoid the dumpster, possibly entering the lane of oncoming traffic and creating hazardous conditions."

It should also maintain a safe distance from the white car ahead in case it decides to turn or merge back into the lane. Additionally, the ego car should be aware that the motorcyclist might enter the road and should be ready to respond accordingly. Caution should be exercised when passing the parked truck and the blue dumpster as they may obstruct visibility and the path, and other road users may emerge suddenly from behind these obstacles. The lack of clear road markings requires the ego car to be vigilant and drive defensively, anticipating the actions of other road users."
