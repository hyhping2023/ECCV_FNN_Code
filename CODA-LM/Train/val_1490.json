        "description and explanation": "In the image observed, there is a large vehicle, such as a truck or a large utility vehicle, positioned directly in front of the ego car. It features a reflective strip on its rear and its backup lights are on, indicating that it may be preparing to move or it is currently stationary as a part of its operation. The presence and uncertainty of the large vehicle's next move directly impacts the ego car's ability to proceed, since it may start moving unexpectedly or continue to occupy the lane for some time.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a pedestrian spotted walking away from the ego car. Due to the pedestrian's proximity to the roadway and the cluttered area they are in, there is a potential safety risk requiring the ego car to monitor their movements closely in case they make an unpredictable or sudden move towards the driving lane.\n\nAdditionally, there are other objects to consider, such as debris and potentially hazardous material located beside the road on the right. These objects could pose a significant risk if they are on or near the ego car's path. They could become obstacles if the debris extends into the driving lane or if pieces are moved onto the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image that hold relevance to the ego car's driving decisions."

Additionally, caution should be exercised due to the pedestrian on the side of the road; it is advisable to monitor his movements. The ego car should slow down due to the uneven road conditions and potential obstacles, ensuring a safe passage through the cluttered area. No movement should be made until the intentions of the large vehicle ahead are clear, and it is confirmed to be safe to do so."
