This truck features visible rear lights and reflective markings. Its presence limits the ego car's maneuverability, necessitating an increased following distance and reduced speed due to the truck's size and potential slow speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white SUV to the right of the ego car, situated in the adjacent lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The SUV's location prevents the ego car from changing lanes to the right.\n\nAhead, beyond the yellow truck, there are traffic lights. However, the status of these lights is unclear from the image. As a result, the ego car must approach cautiously, ready to stop if the light is red."

The ego car should also monitor the adjacent lane for a potential opportunity to overtake, but only if the white SUV provides an adequate gap and it is safe to do so. The driver should be ready to slow down or stop based on the approaching traffic light, whose status is currently unknown."
