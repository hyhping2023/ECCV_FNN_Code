Firstly, there are two yellow construction vehicles present. One is positioned on the right-hand side of the road, partially in the right lane. This construction vehicle could either be maneuvering or stationary due to ongoing construction work, which may affect the flow of traffic and could present an obstruction. The second construction vehicle is located further away, on the left-hand side of the road. It is oriented diagonally and is stationary, suggesting there is ongoing work or a work zone ahead. This requires the ego car to be cautious and possibly change lanes to navigate safely around the work zone.\n\nAdditionally, green directional signs are visible overhead, positioned for lanes going straight. These signs provide directions and indicate the proper lanes for traffic routes, informing the ego car of the correct lanes to be in for the desired direction of travel.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light displaying a red signal for vehicles in the lanes going straight is observed, while left turn signals are green. This indicates that the ego car must stop if it is in a straight-going lane, adhering to the red signal. Meanwhile, the green left turn signals suggest that vehicles in left turn lanes are permitted to proceed.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image, indicating a focus on vehicular traffic and construction activity at this moment."

The ego car should decrease speed and remain alert for possible unexpected changes in traffic flow or obstructions on the road due to construction activities.

It should watch for any construction workers or unexpected movements from construction vehicles. Additionally, it should be prepared to change lanes if the construction work area expands or if directed to do so by construction signage or crew. Remaining alert in this situation is critical due to the reduced visibility around construction equipment and potential changes in traffic patterns."
