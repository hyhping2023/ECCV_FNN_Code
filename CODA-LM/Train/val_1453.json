        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and objects that the ego vehicle must consider. Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a truck loaded with bags and items, taking up most of the lane. The ego vehicle will need to adjust its speed or possibly change lanes to keep a safe distance from the truck due to its position and speed. On the right-hand side of the road, a black vehicle is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. It is important for the ego vehicle to monitor this vehicle to prevent any issues that could arise from merging or lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the left, walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, their proximity to the street means the ego vehicle should remain vigilant in case they attempt to cross the street suddenly or if there are any crosswalks that are not immediately visible.\n\nLastly, the truck in front creates a potential blind spot for the ego vehicle, significantly obstructing the view of the road ahead. To ensure safety and a clear view of the road, the ego vehicle should either maintain a larger following distance or consider changing lanes. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image."

If a lane change is considered to overtake the truck, it should be performed with caution and with consideration for the blind spot and the neighboring vehicle on the right."
