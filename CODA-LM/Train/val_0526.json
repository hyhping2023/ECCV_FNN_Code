It is equipped with a seat for the rider, two wheels, handlebars for steering, and space for potentially storing small items. In future driving scenarios, the presence of this moped parked beside the road may affect the ego car's driving path. Specifically, the ego car might have to adjust its trajectory slightly to maintain a safe clearance from the moped, ensuring it does not collide with it or obstruct the lane.",

As it is parked but still in close proximity to the active roadway, the driver should remain cautious of any sudden movements from the moped or the possibility of someone attempting to depart from the parking spot.
