The presence of the truck suggests that it may start moving when the traffic light changes, potentially entering the intersection or turning, which requires attention from the ego vehicle.\n\nAhead on the right lane, a black car is also stopped at the traffic light. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for the car's potential maneuvers, as it could either continue straight or change lanes once the traffic light allows.\n\nDirectional signs are visible to the right, indicating a right turn ahead as well as straight-through traffic. These signs will guide the ego vehicle's navigation decisions and lane choice. Additionally, there are yield and stop signs visible at the intersection, alerting the ego vehicle that traffic from cross streets may be entering the intersection, requiring caution and possibly the need to yield.\n\nTwo sets of traffic lights are visible, one directly ahead and another off to the right; both are displaying a red signal. Consequently, the ego vehicle must remain stationary until the lights turn green.\n\nOrange traffic cones and warning signs are placed to the right side of the intersection, signaling a closed lane or possible roadwork ahead. This suggests that the ego vehicle should avoid the rightmost lane and proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, there are construction barriers along the right side of the intersection, indicating potential construction activity. The ego vehicle should be prepared for unexpected obstructions or workers near the traffic lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, present in the image, nor are there any barriers other than the construction barriers mentioned. No other objects are described that could affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
