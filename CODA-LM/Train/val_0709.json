Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a white car that may be moving slowly or stopping due to traffic. Additionally, there is a line of various vehicles ahead in the adjacent lanes, which could impact the ego car's ability to change lanes.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are multiple signs visible, including a no parking sign to the right of the ego car, a speed limit sign indicating 50 km/h, and others that prohibit honking and provide direction signs for lanes. These signs are important for dictating the speed limit and required driving behavior in the area.\n\nThe traffic lights include a pedestrian crossing signal displaying the red standing man to the left, which means vehicles have the right of way but should remain cautious of any pedestrians that might cross.\n\nOn the left side, there is a series of yellow traffic cones indicating a lane closure or roadwork ahead, which may necessitate a lane change for the ego car. Concrete and temporary barriers are also present, dividing the lanes and controlling the flow of traffic to prevent vehicles from crossing into oncoming lanes.\n\nLastly, there are no debris, dustbins, or other objects in the vicinity, which means there is no required action for the ego car regarding these non-existent objects."
