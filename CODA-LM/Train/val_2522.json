These materials could include remnants of vehicle parts, disintegrated road materials, or other non-specific trash. Such debris poses a hazard to driving as it might cause vehicles to lose traction, lead to tire damage, or become airborne and cause damage to following vehicles. In response to this, the ego car (the car from whose perspective the image is captured) should reduce speed and steer safely around the debris to avoid potential damage and maintain control of the vehicle.",
