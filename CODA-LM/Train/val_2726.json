Firstly, there's a large orange construction vehicle with an extended arm parked on the street. It's important for the ego car to keep a safe distance and be ready to navigate around this stationary obstacle, ensuring safe passage. Additionally, there are several cars that appear to be either parked or moving slowly on the street ahead of the ego car. The driver of the ego car must exercise caution and stay alert to brake or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential collisions with these vehicles. Lastly, a sizable dumpster or trash container is present on the street. The ego car must be wary of this obstacle and make sure to navigate around it safely, all while keeping an appropriate distance to prevent any contact. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
