Additionally, there is a 'no entry' traffic sign on the right-hand side of the image, which is a red circular sign with a white bar. This sign indicates that the road ahead is not accessible to the ego car, and it must not proceed in that direction. Furthermore, yellow and black traffic cones are placed in front of the ego car, signaling a diversion or road works, which means the area ahead is off-limits and the ego car will need to navigate around them. Lastly, a barrier gate is lowered across the road near the 'no entry' sign, reinforcing the message that the road is closed and the ego car must seek an alternative route. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image."
