Directly in front of the ego car, there is a large red and white tanker truck occupying the same lane. This truck has several hoses attached to its rear section, and its size and position require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance due to the potential hazardous materials the truck might be carrying. Ahead of the tanker truck, a cargo truck with a brown container is situated in the left lane. This cargo truck may influence the ego car's options for lane changes, especially if it seeks to overtake the tanker truck.\n\nNext to the truck in the left lane is a blue circular sign indicating a mandatory direction to the right. This sign informs drivers, including the ego car, that they must prepare to merge right if their current lane ends or is obstructed ahead. Over the lane the ego car is following, there is a traffic light situated on the right side of the road, which is currently green. The green light gives the ego car the right of way to proceed, but it must continue to monitor the light for changes.\n\nIn the ego car's lane, on the right side, white and red traffic cones line up, creating a barrier on the road shoulder. These cones signal potential road works or obstacles, requiring the ego car to stay within the lane limits. Additionally, a concrete barrier with red and white stripes runs along the right edge of the right lane where the ego car is driving. This barrier serves as a physical restriction, preventing vehicles from leaving the road to the right and necessitating that the ego car maintain a safe lateral distance to avoid collision."

Considering the blue mandatory direction sign, the ego car should be ready to merge right as the road may be leading to a junction or lane reduction. Overtaking should be conducted with caution, ensuring that the other lanes are clear and the cargo truck does not impede the maneuver. Continuous monitoring of the traffic light is necessary, and the ego car should remain within the lane markings, respecting the traffic cones and concrete barriers on the right."
