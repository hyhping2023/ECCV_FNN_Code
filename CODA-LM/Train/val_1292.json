Even though they are at a distance, the ego car should monitor their speed and trajectory to adjust its driving strategy accordingly.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity of the ego car's path. While no immediate action is required, the ego car should remain alert for any vulnerable road users that may appear from sidewalks or adjacent areas.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the immediate line of sight of the ego car. In the absence of traffic light cues, the ego car should follow basic road rules and stay vigilant regarding the behavior of other traffic users.\n\nLastly, there is a barrier on the left side of the road, represented by a stack of construction materials. This barrier likely signals ongoing construction or roadworks, so the ego car should maintain a safe distance to prevent any potential hazards.\n\nThese observations form a comprehensive summary of the road users and objects captured in the traffic image, highlighting their relevance to the ego car's driving behavior."
