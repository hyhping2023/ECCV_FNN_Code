While it is not in the same lane, it requires monitoring in case it changes lanes or affects the traffic flow in the ego car's lane.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n    - A yellow and black chevron board is situated on the right side, indicating a curve or corner ahead. This alerts the ego car to a potential change in road direction, which may require an adjustment in speed and increased awareness.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n    - Red and white traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, indicating the presence of a work zone. These cones may signal restricted lanes or changes to the usable roadway ahead.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n    - A temporary barricade is located on the right side of the road. It appears to be part of a work zone, which may necessitate the ego car to adjust its position within the lane to maintain a safe distance.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n    - People on a ladder are working behind a green fence to the right of a bus. Although they are not on the roadway, any unexpected movement or objects falling could pose a hazard, requiring the ego car to remain alert while passing."
