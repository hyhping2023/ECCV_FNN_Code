As a compact motor vehicle, it takes up less space than a car but still contributes to potential obstructions in narrow streets. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, the presence of the moped requires careful navigation to ensure that there is ample clearance when passing by to avoid any contact with the stationary vehicle. Drivers should also be cautious of any sudden movement from the moped if it were to be operated or moved unexpectedly.",
