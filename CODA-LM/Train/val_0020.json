        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements to consider that affect autonomous driving decisions. Three categories of road users and objects are prominent: vehicles, traffic signs, and traffic lights, with an additional presence of traffic cones.\n\nStarting with the vehicles, there are three noted in the image:\n1. A silver sedan is in the process of making a left turn at an intersection, crossing the path potentially taken by the ego vehicle. This could hinder the ego vehicle's ability to proceed.\n2. A dark sedan, situated in the rightmost lane, is turning right and has just overtaken the ego vehicle, partially visible through the front passenger-side window. This movement could impact decisions on whether the ego vehicle should accelerate or decelerate.\n3. A bus is noticed at some distance on the left, stationed within a bus lane at a stop. The bus could begin to merge into traffic soon, which means the ego vehicle needs to monitor it closely for any sudden movements.\n\nFor traffic signs:\n1. Directional signs are installed above the road, clearly marking lane directions and possible destinations which assist in navigation.\n2. A No Parking sign is positioned on the right side near the intersection, though it's more informational regarding the area's parking regulations rather than immediately impacting driving decisions.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there's a green light for the traffic moving straight through the intersection situated in the top center of the image, signaling that it is safe for the ego vehicle to proceed, conditioned on the movement of other vehicles.\n\nLastly, there's a row of traffic cones on the right side of the road, defining a work zone or a temporarily closed lane. This suggests possible workers nearby or a change in usual traffic patterns, necessitating careful navigation.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects affecting the scene observed in the current traffic image. Thus, the autonomous driving system primarily needs to focus on vehicle movements, obey traffic signs and lights, and consider the delineated work area due to the traffic cones."

Additionally, the ego car should be aware of the traffic cone setup for possible obstructions or personnel near the road. Since the traffic light is green and road conditions appear clear, the ego car can proceed with caution after accounting for these considerations."
