However, there is a traffic sign visible; it is a red and white circular sign with Chinese characters, situated on the right side of the road. This sign is important as it indicates that entry for motor vehicles is prohibited in the direction shown by the arrow, which will influence the ego vehicle's decision-making regarding turns or proceeding straight.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange and yellow temporary barriers aligned down the center of the road, creating a divided lane situation. These barriers suggest that there is ongoing road work or alterations to the standard traffic flow, requiring the ego vehicle to exercise caution and potentially reduce speed to navigate safely.\n\nBehind the barriers on the right side, there are trees and construction-related objects. While these objects do not directly impede the ego vehicle's path, they are noteworthy as they could lead to unexpected blockages or the presence of workers on the road, which would require attention and possible adjustments in driving behavior."
