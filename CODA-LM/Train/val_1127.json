The light from its tail lights, which appear illuminated, suggests that the car is active but currently stopped. This situation should hint the ego cars driver to maintain a cautious speed and prepare for potential movements of the parked car, such as reversing out or turning on of indicator lights which could imply intent to join the traffic flow.

The presence of this car in the parking slot represents a typical scenario in a parking lot where vehicles are parked along the sides, potentially limiting the maneuvering space for other cars. The ego cars driver must navigate carefully, maintaining a safe distance and speed to avoid any collisions with parked vehicles such as this one. This also emphasizes the need for vigilance in detecting any sudden movement from the parked cars, as drivers inside might decide to move or exit their parking spots.",
