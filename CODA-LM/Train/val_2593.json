A white van is positioned to the left side and slightly ahead of the ego-vehicle, traveling in an adjacent lane. This van is significant because its location reduces the options for the ego-vehicle to change lanes to the left. Directly in front of the ego-vehicle is a blue flatbed truck carrying a large yellow construction vehicle. The truck is in the same lane as the ego-vehicle and has an impact on the driving behavior by requiring a safe following distance and possibly blocking the view of the road ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light situated above the road ahead, showing a green light for traffic moving straight and a red light for turning left. This traffic light instructs the ego-vehicle that it can continue going straight through the intersection but is prohibited from making left turns at this moment.\n\nThere is no presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image, and hence, they do not impact the driving decisions or environment for the ego-vehicle."

These vehicles are designed for heavy-duty tasks and are commonly used on construction sites for moving large amounts of earth or other materials. In a traffic scenario, the presence of such a vehicle can indicate nearby construction activity, which could lead to potential delays or the need for detours. It may also suggest that there could be sudden stops or reduced speed limits ahead, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected changes in the traffic flow.",

Overtaking should be done with caution if the adjacent lane becomes clear and it is safe to do so. The ego-vehicle should proceed straight at the intersection, obeying the green light, and should not attempt to turn left due to the red signal in that direction. Continuous observation of the traffic light is necessary in case it changes."
