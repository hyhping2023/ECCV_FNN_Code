In the left adjacent lane and slightly ahead is a light-colored SUV, important for decisions regarding lane changes and awareness of blind spots. Additionally, there are vehicles approaching an intersection in the distance, visible over the sedan in front, which could impact decisions at the upcoming intersection, especially if changing lanes or adjusting speed is necessary for a traffic signal.\n\nDirectional signs on an overhead gantry across the roadway provide lane usage information for the upcoming intersection, indicating lanes for straight travel and turns. These signs may necessitate a lane change if the ego car's destination requires a different direction.\n\nLastly, a row of parked vehicles is observed on the right side of the road. The ego car needs to be cautious of pedestrians that might emerge between these vehicles or any vehicle that might pull out into traffic."
