To the right, a yellow vehicle is partially visible, which appears to be a construction or service vehicle. Its presence indicates that there might be construction or maintenance work nearby, potentially affecting the traffic flow.\n\nOn the left side of the road, a motorcyclist wearing a blue jacket is also present. The motorcyclist's potential actions, such as changing lanes or turning, require the ego car to stay alert and be ready to yield or adjust its course accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light showing green is in view, signaling the right of way for the ego car to proceed. However, caution is advised due to the concrete mixer truck ahead and the possibility of nearby construction activities.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that could impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
