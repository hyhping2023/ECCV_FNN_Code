This could cause an obstruction and lessen the room for the ego car to navigate through that space. In addition, on the far left side of the road, there are multiple vehicles, including a white car and a green bus, traveling in the opposite direction. These vehicles arenâ€™t direct hazards, but they do need to be watched for any unexpected lane changes or stops they may undertake.\n\nThere are also pedestrians on the right sidewalk, walking in the same direction as the ego car. They aren't currently on the road itself, but their close proximity to the carriageway means that they should be carefully observed on the off chance they step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nRegarding traffic signs and lights, no specific signs or traffic lights are impacting the driving decisions for the immediate path of the ego car. Therefore, the standard rules of the road should be followed without alterations. Similarly, there are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that would alter or affect the driving conditions or behavior of the ego car, suggesting that the driving conditions are normal without any immediate obstructions or changes to be aware of."

The ego car should maintain its speed according to the posted speed limit and be ready to make any necessary lane adjustments if road conditions change up ahead."
