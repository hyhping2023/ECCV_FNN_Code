First, there is a large truck directly ahead in the same lane, slightly off-centered to the left. This truck is carrying a load of gravel or construction material that could potentially drop small debris, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to react to any falling debris or sudden braking.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is observed on the right side of the road, walking parallel to the driving direction but some distance away from the ego car's lane. The presence of this pedestrian necessitates careful monitoring in case they decide to cross the road or approach closer to the traffic lane.\n\nThere is also a traffic sign on the right side of the road, a blue and white triangular yield sign with a symbol indicating a merge from the right. This sign informs the ego car that there may be vehicles merging from the right, and it should be prepared to yield if necessary.\n\nNo other road users or objects were detected in the image."

Typically deployed for heavy-duty tasks, this type of vehicle often influences traffic flow due to its slow speed and large physical presence. Drivers, including the one of the ego car, must exercise increased caution, adjust their speed, and possibly change lanes when safe to pass such vehicles carefully. Additionally, the presence of a construction vehicle might indicate nearby road work, advising further attentiveness to potential changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles.",
