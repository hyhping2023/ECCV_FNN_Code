As they are positioned close to the vehicle's path, they necessitate extra caution from the ego vehicle which might need to stop to allow for safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic cone placed on the right side of the road ahead, signaling that there might be road work or some kind of obstruction. This could mean that the ego vehicle will need to change lanes or reduce speed to navigate safely around the potential obstacle and comply with road safety regulations.\n\nFinally, the scene includes a median strip barrier that is located between the opposing lanes of traffic. This barrier provides guidance on the flow of traffic, ensuring that vehicles remain in the correct lanes and do not cross into oncoming traffic, which is essential for the safe operation of the autonomous vehicle in maintaining the proper lane discipline."
