The first is a yellow car in an adjacent lane, facing the opposite direction with its front part angled towards the center of the road. This positioning suggests that the yellow car may be executing a maneuver, such as turning or merging. This action affects the flow of traffic and could pose a collision risk for the ego car. The second vehicle is a truck parked on the side of the road, facing away from the ego vehicle. It is notable for its bright, reflective material. The parked truck may be in the process of loading or unloading, which could lead to unexpected pedestrian movement around it or a sudden movement of the truck if it decides to pull into traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."
