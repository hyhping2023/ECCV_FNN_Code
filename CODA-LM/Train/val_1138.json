The vehicle is stationary on the right side of the road and is partially on the pavement with its hazard lights activated. This could indicate that the vehicle is either broken down or parked. Due to its position, it presents an obstacle which may narrow the available driving lane for the autonomous vehicle, requiring it to navigate around the stationary vehicle carefully. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data provided for this particular scene."

The presence of this vehicle influences the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating caution and readiness to maintain a safe lane discipline. The ego car must ensure there is adequate space for both vehicles to pass safely, especially given the narrowness of the road. Adjustments in speed or positioning might be required as the two vehicles approach each other.",

Given the visibility conditions, headlights should be on if they aren't already, and attention should be paid to any potential hazards that may arise due to low light."
