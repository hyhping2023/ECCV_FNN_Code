Firstly, there is one white car directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car, moving in the same direction. The white car's presence and behavior necessitate that the ego car adjusts its speed and maintains an appropriate following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are yellow arrow signs on the left side of the road, indicating that the lane will merge or shift to the right. These signs imply that the ego car must be ready to change lanes or adjust its position in response to potential roadwork or upcoming changes in lane configuration.\n\nAlso present are yellow and black striped traffic cones lined up on the left side of the road, forming a barrier separating the active driving lane from a construction area or a lane that is closed off. The ego car must stay clear of these cones to avoid damaging the vehicle and to respect the integrity of the construction or blocked-off zone.\n\nFurthermore, red and white barriers are situated on both sides of the road. These barriers serve as an indication that the ego car is traveling on a controlled road such as a highway or expressway, and they also function as a safety measure to prevent the car from crossing into oncoming traffic lanes or into restricted areas.\n\nThere were no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects in the image that warranted attention in regards to autonomous driving decisions."
