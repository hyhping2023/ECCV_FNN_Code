This white car will affect the ego car's speed and following distance as it is in its direct path. \n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a height restriction sign indicating a 4-meter clearance. While this sign is crucial for taller vehicles, it is not directly relevant to the ego car.\n\nRegarding barriers, there are red plastic barriers on the right side of the road that separate the construction area from the driving lanes, guiding the ego car to stay within the designated lane. Additionally, there are yellow and black striped barriers on the left side of the road, which help demarcate the lanes and ensure the ego car stays on the correct path.\n\nLastly, other objects include a construction site with scaffolding and cranes around and above the road. The ongoing construction poses a potential hazard as workers or equipment may suddenly enter the roadway, necessitating extra caution from the ego car.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones are present in this scene."
