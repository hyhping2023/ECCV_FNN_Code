This crane may block or restrict the driving lane, requiring the ego vehicle to approach with caution or change lanes. Additionally, a motorcyclist with a blue delivery box is in front of the ego vehicle, slightly to the right. Due to the motorcyclist's ability to quickly change speed or direction, the ego vehicle needs to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for potential evasive maneuvers.\n\nFurthermore, there are two pedestrians standing on the roadway ahead, to the right of the crane, who appear to be waiting or crossing. As pedestrians have the right-of-way and can be unpredictable, the ego vehicle is obligated to stop or slow down to ensure their safety.\n\nTemporary construction barriers are also visible along the right edge of the image, indicating a section of the road is likely designated for construction use. These barriers denote areas off-limits for driving, suggesting that the ego vehicle may need to merge left or adjust its path to avoid the construction zone."
