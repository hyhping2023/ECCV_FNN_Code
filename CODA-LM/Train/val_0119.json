Also present is a traffic officer in the intersection, whose signals may override other traffic controls and mandate careful attention from the ego car.\n\nFor \"traffic lights,\" there is a traffic light ahead showing a red signal, meaning the ego car must stop at the intersection until it turns green.\n\nWithin the \"traffic cones\" category, red and white traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the pedestrian crossing area, indicating a potential hazard or construction zone. The ego car should approach these with caution and consider lane changes if necessary.\n\nNo relevant entities were detected in the categories of \"traffic signs,\" \"barriers,\" and \"other objects.\""
