        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present, suggesting a relatively unobstructed path for an autonomous vehicle. However, there is an object of note categorized under \"other objects.\" This object is described as a white bicycle that is parked against a building to the left of the scene. It is positioned outside of the driving lane, indicating that it does not directly impact the current flow of traffic. The explanation provided emphasizes that stationary objects like parked bicycles generally do not impede vehicle navigation, as long as they are off the drivable roadway. Nonetheless, it is advised that such objects should still be monitored to ensure they do not become obstacles in the future, thus maintaining safety and smooth navigation for the autonomous vehicle."

It includes bags, boxes, and other debris that have been accumulated on the side of the road. In driving scenarios, garbage on the road can be a hazard. It could potentially conceal sharp objects that might damage tires or be struck by a vehicle, causing debris to scatter and create further hazards. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared to avoid such obstacles to prevent damage and ensure safety.",

When driving, seeing a parked moped like this should make the driver of the ego car cautious of the possibility that the owner might return to it suddenly.

If the adjacent lane is not available or safe for maneuvering, the ego car should slow down while passing the trash bags to avoid any potential hazards and be prepared for any unforeseen obstructions."
