This stationary vehicle poses a potential risk as it could unexpectedly move, its door might open, or pedestrians could walk around it, necessitating that the ego car maintains a safe distance to avoid any sudden hazards.\n\nAdjacent to the yellow car, on the sidewalk, stands a pedestrian who appears to be interacting with the parked car. This pedestrian could potentially cross the road or open the car door, creating a hazard that the ego car needs to be prepared for.\n\nOn the bicycle lane next to the sidewalk, a cyclist is observed riding in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's presence directly in the path of the ego car means that any sudden change in direction or position by the cyclist could require the ego car to adjust its speed or lane position to ensure safety.\n\nThe traffic scene also includes various signs. A directional sign above the road provides the name of the road, offering navigational information without directly impacting driving behavior. An orange construction sign, partially obscured to the right of the road, hints at possible construction ahead. This could mean potential road closures, detours, or obstacles, requiring the ego car to be ready to adapt to changing road conditions.\n\nA traffic light visible in the distance, showing red to the right of the road, mandates that the ego car must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the road edge to the right, in front of the yellow car, possibly indicating road work or a hazard. This narrows the usable lane space, signaling that the ego car should proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, a cart is spotted on the sidewalk to the right, next to the yellow car. While it is not currently on the road, such objects could potentially be moved or fall into the road, suggesting that the ego car should remain vigilant of this possibility.\n\nNo barriers were observed in the scene, and thus, they do not impact the current driving conditions."
