This van is in the immediate path of the ego car, requiring the ego car to yield. Additionally, there are several cars situated in the opposite traffic lanes, parallel to the van. Some of these cars are stationary while others are in motion. While they're not affecting the ego car's immediate path, they are part of the surrounding traffic and need to be observed.\n\nOn the right edge of the image, motorcyclists and bicyclists are moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vulnerable road users demand extra vigilance due to their smaller size and potential to quickly change lanes or direction.\n\nThere are traffic signs present as well, including a no parking sign on the right, and a few indistinguishable signs on the left further down the road. These signs are meant to provide information and don't necessitate immediate action by the ego car.\n\nMoreover, a traffic light visible in the top left portion of the image shows a red signal facing the ego car. This red light signals that the ego car is expected to be stationary, or preparing to come to a stop if it's not already at rest.\n\nTemporary barriers have been positioned along the right edge of the road, serving to separate the construction area from the roadway and possibly reducing the driveable space for the ego car and other vehicles.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects in this particular image."
