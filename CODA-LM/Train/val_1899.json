        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large yellow service vehicle characterized by an orange-striped pattern on the rear, situated in the center of the ego carâ€™s lane. The presence of this vehicle is particularly significant because it likely indicates a road service or maintenance activity, which may be proceeding at a pace slower than the normal flow of traffic. Consequently, it is imperative for the autonomous vehicle to remain vigilant of the service vehicle's movements and potential stops as it might carry out its maintenance tasks, necessitating adjustments in the ego car's driving behavior to ensure safety and compliance with traffic conditions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle. It appears to be a heavy-duty truck commonly used in construction or maintenance work, characterized by its robust structure and visible safety markings such as reflective stripes and warning lights. The presence of this vehicle on the road typically indicates nearby construction or maintenance activities, which could lead to traffic delays or detours. Drivers should be cautious when approaching such vehicles, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speed. Observing this vehicle, the ego car should adjust its speed and possibly change lanes if it is safe and necessary to avoid getting too close to the construction operations.",
