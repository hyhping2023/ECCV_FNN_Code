This vehicle is typically equipped with a boom, dipper (or stick), bucket and cab on a rotating platform called the 'house'. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates active or impending roadwork or construction activities in the vicinity. For the ego car, it implies that the driver should be cautious and prepared for potential slow-moving traffic, obstacles, or detours associated with construction. Additionally, sudden movements and the entry or exit of such heavy vehicles can affect traffic flow and require heightened alertness and reduced speeds from nearby drivers, including those in the ego car.",

This type of vehicle is typically used for heavy-duty tasks such as digging, demolition, and moving large quantities of materials. In the driving scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle may suggest ongoing or imminent construction activity nearby, possibly causing traffic slowdowns or lane closures. As a result, the ego vehicle should maintain a vigilant and reduced speed approach, and be prepared for possible changes in traffic patterns or unexpected stops.",

Prepare for potential obstacles and narrowing of the lane due to the parked vehicles and machinery on the right. The ego car should also monitor the white van for any signs of movement. Overall, cautious driving is advised through this area."
