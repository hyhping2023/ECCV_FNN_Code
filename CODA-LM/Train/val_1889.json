        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic cones, and other objects present. On the left side of the ego car, within the left lane and moving in the same direction, there is a white SUV. This vehicle is particularly relevant as its movements may affect the ego car's lane change decisions or the need for speed adjustments. Directly ahead, in the same lane and proceeding forward in the same fashion, is a silver van. The distance to this van will dictate how far the ego car should remain behind to ensure a safe following distance. Opposite the ego car, there are several vehicles in the other lane coming towards it. Keeping an eye on these vehicles is crucial as they can introduce erratic movements or potential hazards that could cross into the ego car's path.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, sharing the same lane, is a group of cyclists. These vulnerable road users necessitate that the ego car modifies its speed and lateral placement on the road to allow for safe overtaking. Adjacent to the right lane are placed traffic cones, signifying probable road works or a lane closure. Consequently, the ego car may need to switch lanes or slow down in response.\n\nAdditionally, there's a dustbin situated at the road's edge on the right. Though it doesn't seem to be a direct risk to the vehicle's pathway at this time, it's important to keep an eye on it should it get displaced onto the road unexpectedly. \n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers are present or relevant to this scene."

The presence of this concrete block next to the road may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating careful navigation to maintain a safe distance.
