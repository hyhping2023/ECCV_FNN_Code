A stationary black car is positioned on the right shoulder of the road, slightly away from the travel lanes. Although this car is not within the normal flow of traffic, its presence may influence the ego car's lane choice to maintain a safe passing distance. Additionally, there are several cars in the left travel lanes moving in the same direction as the ego car. These moving vehicles dictate the flow of traffic and may necessitate changes in speed or lane switches for the ego car.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a speed limit sign indicating '40' is situated on the right side of the road. The ego car must adhere to this speed limit for legal compliance and safety. There is also a No Parking sign on the right that emphasizes restrictions on the shoulder, reinforcing that the black car's positioning is unusual.\n\nFurthermore, orange and white traffic cones are placed on the right side, marking the separation between the shoulder and the travel lane. These cones designate areas that are off-limits for driving, thus necessitating that the ego car remains in the travel lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects were detected in this particular image."
