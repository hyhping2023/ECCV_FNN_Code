        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are a few notable road users and vehicles that can impact the driving behavior of the self-driving car, also known as the ego car.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, there is a three-wheeled vehicle with a load of bulky items that seem to be protruding outwards. The precarious nature of the load poses a potential risk to road safety, as there is a chance that items could fall onto the road and create hazards.\n\nTo the left side of the ego car, there's a white sedan that's moving in the same direction. The location of the sedan is pertinent because it limits the ego car's ability to switch lanes to the left without causing interference.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side of the three-wheeled vehicle, motorcyclists are noticed traveling in the same direction. These motorcyclists are categorized as vulnerable road users due to their reduced protection compared to enclosed vehicles. Consequently, the ego car has to keep a safe distance and stay vigilant for any unexpected moves from the motorcyclists.\n\nThere are no other objects, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers reported in this scenario. All the described objects must be considered by the autonomous driving system to ensure a safe journey."

Being on the road, this vehicle directly influences driving conditions, prompting the ego car to potentially adjust its speed and lane choice to safely pass the slower-moving or stationary construction vehicle, while also being mindful of nearby construction activity that could affect traffic flow.",
