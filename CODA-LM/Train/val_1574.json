The taxi is currently stationary and does not pose an immediate threat to the flow of traffic. However, it is important to monitor the taxi in case it begins to move into traffic.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego vehicle, a pedestrian is crossing the road from right to left. This pedestrian could potentially disrupt traffic and must be carefully considered to ensure safety and prevent any accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there are cable spools located on the sidewalk to the right of the scene. While these spools are not directly in the path of the ego vehicle and do not pose an immediate hazard, they are still significant for maintaining environmental awareness.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that need to be accounted for in this scenario."
