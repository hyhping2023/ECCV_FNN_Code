It serves as a warning for drivers to guide them around construction areas, accidents, or other road disruptions that could interfere with normal driving routes. The presence of this cone suggests that there might be an upcoming area where drivers need to reduce their speed or change lanes.

The presence of the traffic cones suggests that the ego car should remain in the current lane if it is not closed further ahead or prepare for a safe lane change if necessary. The vehicle in the left lane must be considered as well; the ego car should only change lanes if there is a sufficient gap for a safe maneuver. Speed should be moderated due to the potentially slick road conditions. No immediate action is required unless lane closure signs become visible and pertinent to the ego car route."
