The proximity of this parked car is a potential hazard as there is a risk that a door might open into the lane or that the car could start moving unexpectedly, leading to a possible collision.\n\nFurther ahead on the road, multiple traffic lights are visible, and all of them are showing green. This allows the ego vehicle to continue. However, it is essential for the ego vehicle to remain alert for any change in the light signal, which would require the vehicle to stop.\n\nOn the roadside, to the far right, there are waste containers placed near the parked vehicles. These containers are not posing an immediate threat to the ego vehicle, but caution is advised to watch for any pedestrians that might come close to use the containers, making sure road safety is maintained."
