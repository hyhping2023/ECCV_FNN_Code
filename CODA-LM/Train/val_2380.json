Vehicles:\n    - There is a concrete mixer truck positioned immediately in front of the ego car, taking up a substantial portion of the view. Due to the truck's size and how close it is, it significantly restricts the ego car's line of sight and maneuverability, which means that the ego car must maintain a greater distance behind the truck and stay prepared to react to any of the truck's movements.\n    - Further ahead, across the intersection, multiple cars are parked in various lanes but are not moving. These cars could become cross-traffic for the ego car, which will necessitate giving way to these vehicles based on the traffic lights and intersection regulations.\n\n2. Vulnerable Road Users:\n    - A single cyclist is spotted to the right side, moving through the intersection at some distance from the ego car. The cyclist needs to be carefully watched by the ego car due to their vulnerability and the possibility that their path may cross with that of the ego car, which would require the ego car to exercise caution and possibly yield.\n\n3. Traffic Lights:\n    - A traffic light is installed next to the mixer truck and is currently showing a red signal. This red light requires the ego car to remain stationary until it turns green, signifying it is safe to proceed.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects that are relevant to the ego car's driving decisions."

The presence of this truck on the road requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance due to its size and the potential for sudden stops or movements. Driving near such large vehicles often necessitates heightened awareness to avoid debris or concrete spillage that might fall off during transportation.",
