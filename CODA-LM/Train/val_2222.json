These signs are critical for drivers, including the autonomous vehicle, to determine the appropriate lane for their intended route. The ego car must adhere to the guidance of these signs to ensure it remains on the correct trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the rightmost lane, signaling that a section of the lane or the adjacent shoulder is likely undergoing construction or maintenance. As a result, it's important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and stay within the boundaries of its current lane to bypass the cones safely."

The barrier serves the purpose of preventing vehicles from leaving the highway and entering adjacent areas, which in this scenario includes a grassy patch beside the road. The design of this object also involves reflecting materials which enhance its visibility under different lighting conditions, encouraging drivers to maintain lane discipline and reduce the risk of accidents by veering off the intended path.",
