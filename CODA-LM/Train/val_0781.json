This vehicle is partially obstructing the lane and could potentially hide pedestrians or other road users emerging from the front or side, thereby narrowing the driveable space for the ego car.\n\nSecondly, a dark-colored car is also parked on the right side of the road but is facing away from the ego car. Although this car is not blocking the ego car's path, the behavior of its driver should be monitored in case they decide to join the flow of traffic or open a vehicle door.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist traveling ahead of the ego car, positioned in the center of the lane and moving in the same direction. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from the motorcyclist to respond appropriately to any sudden movements or stops.\n\nLastly, a green dustbin is placed on the right side of the road. While the dustbin is not on the roadway itself and should not affect driving behavior, it could become an obstacle if it were to be moved into the driving path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image that would impact driving decisions for the ego car."
