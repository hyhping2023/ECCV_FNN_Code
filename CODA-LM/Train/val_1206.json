Directly ahead, there is a sedan partially visible on the left with illuminated brake lights, indicating that it is either stationary or moving slowly. This suggests that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be ready to stop or slow down. Additionally, there is another vehicle ahead on the right side with visible tail lights, appearing to be stationary beside the road. This parked vehicle indicates the ego car should navigate around it carefully, being cautious of any potential unexpected movements or opening doors from that vehicle. Beyond the vehicles, there are reflections on the windshield along with artifacts from environmental lighting, which could distract or mislead the ego vehicle's sensors or the driver, necessitating extra caution."

            "description and explanation": "This is an automobile observed ahead of the ego vehicle. Automobiles such as this are typically equipped with lights which help in visibility during the night, as seen in this image where the tail lights are visibly illuminated. For future driving behavior, observing the lights and movement of this automobile is crucial. If the lights indicate braking, the ego vehicle should also prepare to reduce speed or stop. Observational awareness of this automobile is vital to maintain safe driving distance and to anticipate any sudden changes in its speed or direction.",

Tricycles such as this often have a significant width and slower speed compared to standard automobiles, making them potential hazards in trafficked areas. For the ego vehicle, knowing the presence and position of such a tricycle is important in navigational decisions, especially when passing or when in cramped traffic conditions. The ego vehicle driver should maintain a heightened sense of awareness to avoid colliding or forcing the tricycle into compromising situations, ensuring safe maneuvering around it.",

The ego car should also be prepared for reduced traction or hidden obstacles due to the low visibility conditions."
