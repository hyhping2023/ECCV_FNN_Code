This is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and to anticipate stops.\n    - There is moderate to heavy traffic ahead on the same road, consisting of a mix of sedans and larger vehicles, all with their rear lights on, signifying active braking or slow-moving conditions. This density and behavior of traffic can lead to sudden stops and requires constant attention to adapt speed and following distance accordingly.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n    - No clear traffic signs are visible in the immediate vicinity of the ego car that would influence its driving behavior. The absence of signs means default road rules and lane guidance apply.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n    - Multiple traffic lights are in view showing red across what appears to be an intersection, requiring all vehicles to come to a complete stop. Since the traffic lights are red, the ego car and other road users must stop and wait for the lights to change to green before proceeding.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n    - Traffic cones are visible on the right-hand side, indicating possible lane closures or roadworks. The cones suggest that the adjacent lane might be closed or that there are road works ahead, which could affect lane choices and require reduced speeds.\n\n5. **Barriers**:\n    - Temporary blue and white barriers separate the lanes from the sidewalk on the right, narrowing the available lanes for vehicular movement. These barriers imply that vehicles need to maintain lane discipline and may indicate a probable construction zone.\n\nNo vulnerable road users or other objects were observed in the image."
