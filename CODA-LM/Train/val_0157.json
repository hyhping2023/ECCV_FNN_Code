A silver sedan is directly ahead of the ego car, positioned centrally in the lane and moving in the same direction. The presence of this vehicle dictates the speed and following distance of the ego car. To the left side of the road, there is a white bus parked by the sidewalk, which could potentially block the view and might unpredictably merge back into the flow of traffic.\n\nPedestrians are crossing the street in front of the ego car within a marked crosswalk. These individuals have the right of way, requiring the ego car to stop and allow them to cross safely before proceeding.\n\nThe area around the crosswalk is lined with orange traffic cones, hinting at a possible need for extra caution, such as an area to avoid or a need for a lane change due to road work or a hazard.\n\nLow barriers or curbs are present to the right side of the road, creating a physical division between the walkway and the carriageway. These barriers have the effect of potentially reducing the available width for vehicles on the road.\n\nAdditionally, trees and street poles positioned along the roadside might obstruct the view of traffic signs or signals. These objects necessitate alertness to ensure any obscured road information is adequately observed.\n\nThere are no specific traffic signs, traffic lights, or other noteworthy road users or objects mentioned, indicating their absence or irrelevance in the particular scenario described."
