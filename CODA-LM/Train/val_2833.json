The parked truck may obstruct part of the lane and could require caution when passing. Secondly, several yellow construction vehicles are also parked on the side of the road. The presence of these construction vehicles suggests potential roadwork or construction activities ahead, which may impact traffic flow or result in lane closures. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

The presence of such a construction vehicle on or near the driving path indicates ongoing construction activities in the area. This could potentially influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle by necessitating reduced speed for safety and possible detours or delays due to construction activities or partial road closures.",

If the fog becomes too dense and visibility is severely impaired, consider pulling over to a safe location until conditions improve."
