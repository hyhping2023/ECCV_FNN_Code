This indicates that the truck may be slowing down or stopping, potentially due to road maintenance or an issue with the vehicle. The truck's presence reduces the ego car's visibility and reaction time, necessitating readiness to stop or maneuver around it.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users:** Pedestrians are visible on the crosswalk at the traffic intersection. Since pedestrians have the right of way at crosswalks, the ego car must yield to them by stopping or slowing down to ensure their safety.\n\n- **Traffic Lights:** A red traffic light is visible on the traffic signal pole above the intersection. This red light requires the ego car to come to a complete stop and wait until the light turns green before proceeding.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Visible features include a flat platform, safety striping, and often additional equipment stored on the back. The presence of such a vehicle suggests possible nearby construction or roadwork. For the ego vehicle, this indicates the need to be alert for potential obstacles or changes in road layout ahead, slow down, and follow any temporary traffic signs or directions from construction personnel to ensure safety. This vehicle may also influence traffic flow, potentially causing delays or requiring rerouting.",
