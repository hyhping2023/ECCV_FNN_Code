Firstly, there is a large, yellow construction vehicle stopped directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the whole lane. The significant size and position of this construction vehicle necessitate maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to stop or wait behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dark-colored car stopped in the left lane adjacent to the construction vehicle. Its presence is crucial for the ego vehicle to consider in terms of spacing and the potential for lateral movement when the traffic lights change.\n\nMoreover, there are directional signs on the left side of the intersection, which provide information on the available straight path or right turn from the road the ego vehicle is on. While these signs aid in navigation, they do not directly influence the immediate driving decisions at this moment since they are more relevant for route planning.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic lights are currently red, visible directly in front of the ego vehicle at the intersection. This traffic control requires the ego vehicle to stay stopped and wait for the lights to turn green before proceeding.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, indicating that these categories are not present or are not affecting the driving scenario at the time of observation."

Its presence directly in front of the ego car affects future driving behavior as the ego car must maintain a safe following distance due to the larger size and slower nature of such industrial vehicles. The trucks size could also inhibit visibility, requiring increased caution and potentially necessitating lane changes to maintain visual awareness and safe maneuverability.",
