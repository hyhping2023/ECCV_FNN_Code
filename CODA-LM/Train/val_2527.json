This truck affects the ego car's driving behavior; it will need to keep a safe distance and be prepared to either stop or change lanes if necessary. Additionally, there's a traffic light ahead displaying red, which mandates that all vehicles, including the ego car, must come to a complete stop. The vehicle must adhere to this signal and await the green light before proceeding. On the roadside, there's a brightly lit McDonald's sign, which may capture the attention of some drivers. Despite this potential distraction, the ego car should stay concentrated on the road and other immediate road users for safety. There are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

Thus, future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for potential slow-downs or sudden stops from this vehicle, especially in areas near construction sites where it may be actively used.",
