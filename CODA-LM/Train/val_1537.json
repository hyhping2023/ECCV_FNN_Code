This truck's size, position, and potential slow movement significantly affect the following distance and lane choice of the ego car. Additionally, there is a white sedan to the right of the mixer truck, partially visible and occupying the adjacent lane.

It is characterized by its large rotating drum used to mix concrete components while transporting them to construction sites. For the ego car in this driving scenario, maintaining a safe distance from this vehicle is crucial due to possible hazards like sudden stops or debris falling from the truck. The width and operational nature of the truck may also affect passing opportunities, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and possibly adjust speed or change lanes to safely navigate around it.",

Be aware of the white sedan on the right to avoid any collisions if a lane change becomes necessary. Since the traffic light is green, prepare to proceed through the intersection following the truck unless indicators suggest the truck might be turning or stopping, in which case it may be safe to pass using the right lane. However, ensure the right lane is clear and the sedan has been accounted for before changing lanes. Always be prepared to adjust speed or position in response to the actions of the mixer truck and other vehicles in adjacent lanes."
