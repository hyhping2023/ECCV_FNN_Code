While they are not currently on the road, their potential to walk onto the crosswalk may affect how the ego vehicle navigates the intersection.\n\nA no parking sign is present on the right side of the road along with directional signs pointing to available services, like parking areas. Although these signs provide valuable information, they do not require an immediate reaction regarding the ego vehicle's driving behavior.\n\nAbove the road, there is a traffic light displaying a green signal. This indicates that the ego vehicle can continue its journey when it is safe.\n\nRed and white striped barriers mark the left edge of the drivable road, signaling areas where vehicles are prohibited from passing. These barriers are critical as they establish the limits of the usable roadway, restricting the space for potential maneuvers.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects identified in the image that impact the driving scenario for the ego vehicle."
