The significant size and weight of this truck necessitate increased stopping distances and could potentially impair the visibility for the driver of the ego car. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a cautious following distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, a blue bus is present in the lane to the left of the ego vehicle. The bus is parallel to and traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Buses are known to stop frequently to pick up and drop off passengers, which may influence the traffic flow and necessitate the ego vehicle to be vigilant for potential sudden stops or other vehicles merging into the lane.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a red and white billboard visible. However, it does not seem to be related to traffic regulations that would be directly relevant to the driving scenario at hand. Billboards are typically for advertising purposes and should not affect driving decisions, but they can be a distraction, and drivers are advised to keep their focus on the road.\n\nYellow barriers have been placed along the right-side edge of the road, delineating the boundary of the driving lane. Barriers such as these often signify construction zones or areas that are not accessible to vehicles, indicating that drivers must stay within the marked lanes and maintain a secure distance from these barriers.\n\nThe traffic scenario does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would need to be taken into account."
