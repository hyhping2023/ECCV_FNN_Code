However, there is an overhead electronic traffic sign indicating that ahead there is a leftward road deviation to be aware of. This indicates a change in the travel direction, necessitating the ego vehicle to possibly adjust its lane positioning to prepare for the upcoming turn or detour.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are placed along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, creating a delineated path. These cones suggest there may be road work or some kind of hazard on the right side, thus the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the cones and might need to reduce speed as a precaution.\n\nFurthermore, there is a solid, continuous white barrier found on the right side of the road, extending into the distance. This barrier serves as a separation between the road and a construction area, indicating that there is no entry to that area and reminding the ego vehicle to remain in the current traffic lane.\n\nTraffic lights and other objects are not mentioned in the report, so there is nothing to report regarding these categories in the image."
