        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are two vehicles present. The first is a large truck with a mechanical arm that is taking up the rightmost lane and encroaching slightly on the middle lane. The size and position of the truck could block drivers' views and its mechanical arm may create hazards, especially if it makes sudden movements or stops. The second vehicle is a red sedan driving ahead in the middle lane. This sedan influences the traveling pace of the ego car and any changes in its speed or direction will need to be accounted for by the ego car's autonomous driving system.\n\nThere is a directional sign overhead indicating destinations such as Xingzhou. While this sign doesnâ€™t impact immediate driving behaviors, it provides important navigation information for route planning.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects. Therefore, these categories have no impact on the driving environment and can be disregarded in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically equipped with what appears to be a crane or mechanical arm. Its presence on the road is significant due to its larger size and the potential for sudden or unpredictable movements. Future driving behavior for the ego car involves maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for potential slow-downs or stops that might occur if the construction vehicle is actively involved in roadwork or if it is making turns into work sites. The ego car might also need to change lanes safely if the construction vehicle occupies more space or performs operations that obstruct the regular flow of traffic.",

Keep an eye on the truck's mechanical arm and give it a wide berth to avoid any potential hazards. Proceed with caution and at a speed appropriate for the road conditions and traffic flow."
