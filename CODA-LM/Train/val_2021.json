First, a yellow construction vehicle is present on the left side of the two-lane road and is moving in the same direction as the ego car. Its considerable size and slower pace than the usual traffic flow may hinder the ego car's travel or necessitate a change of lanes. Secondly, there is a white sedan situated ahead on the right side, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The sedan's position could influence the ego car's ability to maneuver around the construction vehicle, especially if a lane change is needed.\n\nAdditionally, there is some litter scattered on the side of the road, including a yellow object near the curb on the left side. Although these items are not on the roadway and not immediate threats, they pose potential risks if they were to be carried onto the driving path of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically what appears to be a bulldozer. It is large and bulky with a prominent front arm and blade used for moving large amounts of material like dirt or gravel. The bulldozer is characterized by its caterpillar tracks and heavy-duty construction. This type of vehicle often moves slowly and can impede traffic flow. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and may need to adjust speed or wait for the construction vehicle to clear the way or complete its movement. The presence of such a vehicle could also indicate nearby construction activity, which might lead to detours or additional traffic control measures that the driver needs to be aware of.",
