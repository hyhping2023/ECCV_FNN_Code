However, there are two vulnerable road users: an adult and a child, both crossing the street and wearing jackets, one blue and one orange. These pedestrians are directly in the path of the ego car, which means the vehicle must yield to them to ensure their safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs visible in the image that would affect the immediate driving scenario. This implies that the standard traffic rules are in effect, and there are no specific changes to the right-of-way or speed limits that the ego car needs to adhere to.\n\nSimilarly, there are no traffic lights in view that would influence the current driving situation. Therefore, the ego car is required to navigate the intersection using the standard traffic rules and determining the right-of-way based on the situation.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a barrier that is partially obstructing the parking lane. This barrier may be indicative of roadwork or could be signaling that access to the parking lane is restricted. As a result, the ego car is guided to remain in the driving lane and avoid the parking lane.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects in the image that would impact the driving conditions for the ego car."
