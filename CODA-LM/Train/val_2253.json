        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scenario, there are a couple of road users in view along with road infrastructure that influences driving behavior. We have a white car in the left lane, which is moving in the same direction as our ego car. Careful consideration must be given to this vehicle's positioning, as it could affect the decision-making of the ego car, particularly with regards to lane changing or adjusting speed to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white truck in the distance, located in the right lane and also heading in the same direction as the ego car. The truck's presence is important to consider for the ego car's speed regulation and lane selection decisions, especially in situations where overtaking or keeping a sufficient following distance is crucial.\n\nRegarding road infrastructure, a continuous barrier is present on the right side of the road. It serves as a physical separator between the active lanes of traffic and either a construction area or off-road zone. Due to this barrier, the ego car is restricted from making any moves to the right such as overtaking or pulling over to the side. This also serves as a signal to the driver of the ego car that there might be construction activities ahead necessitating caution and potential changes in normal driving patterns.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects in the image that warrant attention according to the provided data."

The presence of this cone in the driving environment suggests there may be nearby road work or a specific lane closure. It aims to alert the driver to modify their driving path to avoid potential hazards, promoting safety by guiding traffic flow and maintaining organized lane usage.",

Overtake if necessary, but only when it's safe and legal to do so, keeping in mind the barrier to the right limits options for evasion maneuvers."
