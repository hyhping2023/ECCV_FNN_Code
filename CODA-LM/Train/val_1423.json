Firstly, there is a black vehicle parked on the right side of the road with its trunk open, which is partially obstructing the ego car's lane. This parked vehicle presents a challenge as it reduces the available driving space and could potentially conceal pedestrians or objects that might enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are oncoming vehicles in the left lane, identifiable by their illuminated headlights, indicating that it is nighttime. The ego car must navigate carefully around the parked vehicle to avoid any collisions with the oncoming traffic.\n\nA person is observed standing near the open trunk of the parked vehicle on the right side. This individual could step onto the road, posing a potential risk that the ego car needs to be ready to respond to.\n\nFurthermore, a motorcyclist is seen ahead of the parked vehicle on the right. The motorcyclist's presence requires the ego car to keep a safe distance and be vigilant, as the motorcyclist may change lanes or stop suddenly.\n\nIn the distance, multiple traffic lights are visible, displaying red, yellow, and green lights. Since these lights serve different lanes or directions, the ego vehicle must identify the correct light for its intended path and adhere to the signal.\n\nThe JSON data does not include any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, indicating that these elements are not present in the traffic image."
