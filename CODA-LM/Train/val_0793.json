The first is a heavy truck with an open top loaded with debris, directly in front of the ego vehicle, taking up most of the lane. The presence of this truck necessitates that the ego vehicle maintain a safe following distance for adequate reaction time in case the truck slows down or stops. Behind this truck is a smaller truck, partially visible and in the same lane as the ego vehicle, which influences the speed and flow of traffic that the ego car must adhere to.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians, or motorcyclists visible in the image, so no specific action is required concerning them.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a U-turn sign on the left side of the road, indicating that the ego vehicle should be alert to vehicles in adjacent lanes that may attempt a U-turn. Additionally, there is a road sign on the right side beyond the traffic lights, signaling a junction or merging lane ahead, which means the ego vehicle should be cautious of other vehicles that might merge into their lane from the right.\n\nThe traffic lights for the ego vehicle's lane are green, allowing the vehicle to proceed, but caution is still necessary to watch for any changes in the light as the vehicle approaches the intersection.\n\nLastly, there is temporary green fencing on the right side of the road, suggesting possible construction activity. This barrier indicates that the ego vehicle should be ready for potential road work, lane shifts, or unexpected obstacles. Traffic cones and other objects are not present in the image."
