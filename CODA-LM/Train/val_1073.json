Its noticeable height and width may limit the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car. Due to its size, the ego car may need to maintain a safe following distance to have enough reaction time in case the mixer truck stops or slows down abruptly. The second vehicle is a sedan on the right side of the ego car, positioned slightly ahead in an adjacent lane and appears to be in motion. The ego car should monitor the sedan's movement to anticipate any potential lane changes or merging actions from the sedan. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a heavy construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. Characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement, this type of vehicle typically moves slower than regular traffic due to its size and the weight of its load. When driving a vehicle like the ego car, it is crucial to maintain a safe following distance from such construction vehicles. Their presence often indicates nearby construction zones, which can lead to sudden stops or reduced speed limits, impacting the flow of traffic and potentially requiring the ego car to reduce speed or change lanes to navigate safely around the construction site.",
