        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present. However, the image does contain other objects. Specifically, there are cable spools placed on the right side of the road. While these spools are not situated on the driving path and do not pose an immediate threat to the vehicle's path, it's important for the autonomous system to monitor them. The reason for vigilance is to ensure that if the spools were to roll onto the road, or any activity associated with them were to spill into the driving lane, it can be appropriately managed to maintain safety."

These cables are typically used for electrical or telecommunications purposes. While this is a stationary object and does not pose a direct threat to the movement of vehicles, it is important for drivers to stay aware of such materials near roadways as they could indicate nearby work zones or potential hazards if not properly secured.",
