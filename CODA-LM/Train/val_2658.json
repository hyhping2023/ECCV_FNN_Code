The image captures a close-up view of a large truck's wheels and undercarriage, with only a partial view of the truck's side visible. The immediate proximity to the truck is of particular interest as it suggests that the ego vehicle is very close to the truck. This situation requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance to avoid any potential collisions, indicating the importance of cautious driving behavior in this scenario.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The cap provides access for refueling the vehicle's fuel tank, typically holding diesel for such large commercial vehicles. The presence of a fuel tank cap close to the road surface suggests that it is essential for drivers, especially those behind and adjacent to this truck, to maintain safe distances and remain aware. This ensures they avoid any potential hazards that might occur if the tank were to be accidentally opened or damaged in traffic.",
