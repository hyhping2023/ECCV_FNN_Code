        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a variety of elements present that affect the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle. Firstly, there's a large tanker truck on the left, in the neighboring lane, and moving in the same direction as our vehicle. The size of the tanker is a concern as it can block our view and we must be vigilant in case it makes sudden lane changes or comes to an abrupt stop. Ahead and at a distance, a red truck is observed. Although it is moving in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle, and not an immediate threat, it is critical to keep a safe following distance should the truck reduce speed or halt. On the right, and a bit ahead, there is a blue three-wheeled vehicle traveling along the same route as our vehicle. Owing to its lesser stability and speed, extra room and caution must be afforded when passing.\n\nOn the right side of the road, pink and white traffic cones are spotted, signaling that part of the road or a lane is currently out of service. The autonomous vehicle should take heed to avoid the designated area as it may contain hazards or ongoing roadworks. Additionally, there's a roadside structure situated on the right which could hide pedestrians or other road users from view. This necessitates increased alertness from the autonomous vehicle to potential road users who might appear suddenly from blind spots.\n\nThis scene does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers. Hence, the autonomous vehicle can disregard these elements in its current navigation strategy."
