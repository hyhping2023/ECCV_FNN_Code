However, there is one overhead directional traffic sign with Chinese characters that are guiding drivers toward Jianguoyi Road and other destinations, which is important for drivers who are looking to follow the correct route to their intended location.\n\nThe scene also includes orange and white traffic cones neatly lined up, dividing the roadwork area on the left from the available lanes on the right, functioning as a clear indication for drivers to stay within the boundaries of the open lanes and avoid the restricted zones due to ongoing roadwork.\n\nFurthermore, there are blue and white striped barriers positioned alongside the sidewalk on the right side of the image, with a section behind them being cordoned off by a yellow fence, signaling a construction zone. This arrangement communicates to road users where the safe areas are and where they should not enter.\n\nLastly, there are obstructions on the far left side of the road, including a fallen traffic cone and a blue and white striped barrier. These items are hazards that drivers must be cognizant of to avoid potential collisions and maintain safety on the road."
