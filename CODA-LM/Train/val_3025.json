While this sign does not directly impact the driving behavior, it suggests there may be nearby activities or points of interest.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car's lane, there are multiple orange and red traffic cones aligned in a row, indicating a work zone or lane closure. These cones alert the ego car that the adjacent lane is not accessible and that it should not attempt to merge into that lane.\n\nFurthermore, temporary red and white barriers are set up sequentially on the right side of the road, signifying a partition for a construction or roadwork zone. These barriers signal that there is restricted access to parts of the road, and they remind the ego car to stay in the left lane and be alert for any potential hazards such as workers, machinery, or sudden obstructions that might appear."
