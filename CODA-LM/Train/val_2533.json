Its presence indicates ongoing construction or maintenance work in the area. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, this implies the need for heightened alertness and readiness to respond to temporary road signs, potential obstacles, or detours. The vehicle's size and operation area could affect traffic flow, possibly causing delays or requiring lane changes. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speed in this zone.",
