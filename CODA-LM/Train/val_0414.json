This vehicle's positioning and the visible brake lights suggest that it may be stopping for the traffic light or for pedestrians crossing the street, impacting the ego car's ability to maneuver or change lanes.\n  \n- Multiple pedestrians are observed crossing the street directly in front of the ego car, occupying the crosswalk. Their presence and movement across the road mean that the ego car must remain stopped to ensure their safe passage.\n\n- Several traffic lights are visible in the scene, all showing a red light for the direction the ego car is facing. This red light mandates that the ego car must stop at the intersection and wait until the light turns green before proceeding."
