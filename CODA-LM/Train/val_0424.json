Additionally, several cars are parked on the side of the road, on the left, and are not in motion. These parked cars pose a risk as they could obstruct the view of pedestrians or other road users who might emerge from between them.\n\nOn the right side, motorcyclists are present, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Motorcyclists can be more vulnerable and less visible, so it is important to maintain a safe passing distance and stay alert for any sudden changes in their direction.\n\nA red and white 'No Entry' sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating that vehicles cannot enter the road ahead. As a result, the ego car must not proceed straight if a no-entry zone begins ahead and will need to find an alternative route.\n\nA black barrier is also visible to the right, indicating a closed area or construction zone. Barriers typically mark off-roadwork or hazards and can narrow lanes or indicate changes in traffic patterns, so the ego vehicle should be cautious and prepared to adjust its lane position if required.\n\nLastly, a green bus is visible in the far left of the image, moving parallel to the ego vehicle. The bus may make frequent stops, and passengers may disembark, which requires the ego vehicle to be cautious of pedestrians that may cross in front or behind the bus."
