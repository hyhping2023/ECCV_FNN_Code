This parked car may obstruct the view and driving path, which means that extra caution is necessary when passing by. Additionally, there are several other cars parked along the street. The presence of these parked cars on both sides of the street effectively narrows the driving lane, and as a result, drivers should proceed slower and with more care.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a person walking a dog on the street. Pedestrians and animals on the road are potential hazards, and it is important for the ego car to slow down and be ready to yield or stop to ensure safety. There are also several people standing or walking on the sidewalks. Even though they are not directly in the driving path, these pedestrians should be monitored closely since they may unexpectedly step onto the street. Furthermore, there is a person on a bicycle on the street. The cyclist, being a vulnerable road user, requires the ego car to exercise extra caution and possibly change lanes to pass safely, ensuring enough space is given to the cyclist.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, which suggests that these categories do not contain any road users or objects that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car in this scenario."
