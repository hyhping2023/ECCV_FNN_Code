It appears to be stationary with debris near its rear. The presence of this truck may indicate that it is either unloading or has broken down. Its position can obstruct the lane for the ego car and other traffic, necessitating a move to the left to avoid it.\n\nAdditionally, overhead directional signs are visible, spanning across the road. These signs indicate lanes and directions for travel, providing essential guidance for the ego car to choose the correct lane to reach its intended destination.\n\nTraffic cones and striped barriers are placed along the centerline of the road. They indicate a separation between the lanes and a redirection of traffic flow. The cones and barriers guide the flow of traffic and signal that lane changes must be approached with caution, suggesting that there may be lane merging or shifts in the traffic pattern.\n\nLastly, metal barriers are installed alongside the left edge of the road, creating a physical separation from the pedestrian area. These barriers serve to prevent vehicles from accidentally swerving into pedestrian zones and help to guide the traffic flow.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."
