This means the ego car must not stop or park in this area.\n- **Traffic Cones**: Multiple orange traffic cones are positioned on the left side, narrowing the driving lane. These cones likely mark road work or a hazard, requiring the ego car to slow down and navigate cautiously.\n- **Barriers**: Blue and white striped barriers are positioned on the right side of the road, blocking off an area. These indicate a restricted area that the ego car cannot enter, so it should maintain its lane and avoid crossing over.\n\nNo vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects were present in the image."
