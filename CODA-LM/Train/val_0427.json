        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a white car ahead of the autonomous vehicle in the same lane, moving in the same direction. The presence of this vehicle requires the autonomous car to regulate its speed and maintain an adequate following distance. Additionally, a truck is parked on the right side of the road, with workers actively unloading materials. The truck constitutes a temporary obstruction narrowing the lane, which may necessitate a lane change for the autonomous vehicle to continue safely.\n\nAdjacent to the parked truck, several construction workers are on the right side, with some on the roadway itself. Their closeness to the traffic lane demands that the autonomous car proceed with extra caution, reduced speed, and increased awareness to prevent any incidents.\n\nThere's also a traffic sign displaying a speed limit of 40 km/h. This sign dictates the maximum legal speed, prompting the autonomous vehicle to either maintain its current speed or adjust it to comply with the stated limit.\n\nTraffic cones are positioned along the right side of the road, signaling a lane closure or marking a construction zone. These cones guide the autonomous vehicle to stay within the open lane, which may influence its navigational path and affect the general flow of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, yellow barriers are installed on the side of the road, effectively delineating the active lanes from the construction area. These barriers serve to keep the autonomous vehicle from straying into the construction zone, ensuring a safe division between the work area and traffic.\n\nThe traffic image in question does not feature any traffic lights or other objects that would impact the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."
