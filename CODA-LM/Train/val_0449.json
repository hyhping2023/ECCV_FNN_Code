This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and match its pace to that of the vehicle ahead.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light situated on the right side above the road is green, indicating that the ego car's lane has the right of way, allowing the vehicle to continue. The green signal dictates that the ego car should remain vigilant while it proceeds, as it might need to respond to the surrounding traffic environment.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are orange and white traffic cones signifying lane narrowing or potential roadside work or hazards. These cones necessitate that the ego car exercises extra caution and possibly adjusts its lateral position within the lane to safely avoid them.\n\nComplementing the cones, there is a temporary fencing barrier also on the right with reflective patterns to ensure visibility. This barrier reinforces the change in lane conditions and highlights the importance of the ego car to stay towards the left side of the lane, steering clear of any roadside hazards.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects within the image that affect driving behavior."
