        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are two noteworthy categories of road users to consider for safe navigation: traffic signs and traffic cones.\n\nFirstly, there's a traffic sign highlighted in the scene. Specifically, it's a height limit sign that displays a restriction of '2.6 m' situated before entering an underpass. This sign plays a crucial role in informing drivers, especially those in control of oversized vehicles, about the maximum height allowed to safely pass through the underpass without any risk of collision.\n\nSecondly, the scene includes orange traffic cones that are strategically positioned in the right lane, closely aligned with a wall. These cones serve as a clear indication that the right lane is currently not accessible, most likely due to ongoing maintenance or construction activities. Consequently, this setup advises drivers to prepare for a necessary lane merge to the left to continue their journey without interruptions.\n\nTogether, these elements within the traffic environment provide essential information and guidance, showcasing the importance of attentiveness to traffic signs and temporary road configurations for all drivers."
