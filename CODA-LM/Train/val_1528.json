The headlights should be used to ensure the pedestrians are clearly seen, and the vehicle should remain stationary until the pedestrians have reached the other side of the street and it is safe to proceed. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the lighted road sign for any instructions that might affect subsequent driving behavior, such as speed limits or directional changes. Extra vigilance is required due to the nighttime conditions."
