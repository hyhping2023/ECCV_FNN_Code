This truck is partially obstructing the lane, leaving a narrow space for passage. This could necessitate the ego vehicle to maneuver around the truck, potentially encroaching into the oncoming lane, which would be dangerous if there is oncoming traffic.\n\nThere are also pedestrians in the vicinity of the ego vehicle. One is walking on the right, moving away from the ego vehicle's path, while another is standing near the parked blue truck, seemingly occupied with some work. The pedestrians' close proximity to the vehicle's potential path necessitates extra vigilance to ensure they do not step into the road unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, there is construction debris and materials positioned on the right side of the road. These items are close enough to the driving lane to be a concern, as they could pose a hazard by narrowing the drivable width of the roadway, requiring the ego vehicle to steer carefully to maintain a safe passage."
