Additionally, there are several vehicles ahead in the same lane and the opposing lane, including a bus on the left side. These vehicles, with their slower movement or potential to stop suddenly, will impact the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n\nChevron warning signs are located to the right side of the road, indicating a possible curve or junction ahead. This sign alerts the ego car to potential changes in the road layout and suggests required maneuvering or speed adjustments.\n\nWhile traffic lights are present, they are not distinctly identifiable in this image. The status of these lights is crucial for determining whether the ego car should stop, yield, or proceed, but they are not visible here.\n\nOrange traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the road, channeling traffic away from that section. These cones indicate areas where travel is restricted due to construction or road work, and the ego car will need to maintain a lane position away from these cones.\n\nYellow and black striped barriers are seen on both sides of the road, possibly indicating reduced road width or construction. These barriers may narrow the drivable area, requiring the ego car to adjust its lateral position to safely navigate through."
