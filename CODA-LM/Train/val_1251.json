This vehicle has an object on its roof, possibly a taxi sign, indicating it is a service vehicle. Although the vehicle is static, caution is advised because its doors might open suddenly or it may re-enter traffic, affecting the driving path of the ego car. Additionally, there is a person standing next to the parked vehicle near some large reels of cable. This person may move towards the road or cross it, presenting a potential hazard, so the ego car should closely monitor their movements. Lastly, the large reels of cable and a waste bin are placed on the sidewalk on the right side of the road.

The spool, typically made from wood or steel, is designed to hold and dispense long lengths of cable or wire. Positioned adjacent to a vehicle and away from the direct lane of traffic, it does not impede the motion of vehicles but should be acknowledged, especially if maneuvers such as parking or turning are to be executed near its location, to maintain a safe driving environment.",

Positioned in proximity to the road, it appears to be part of a construction or maintenance site. Its presence near the driving lane indicates a potential obstruction or reduced road width, suggesting that the ego vehicle may need to slow down and proceed with caution. Additionally, the presence of such equipment suggests ongoing work in the area, possibly altering typical traffic patterns and requiring increased driver awareness.",

Monitor the sidewalk objects in case of any sudden changes but no immediate action required for them."
