Although the sedan is stationary and does not directly affect the driving behavior of the ego car, caution is advised, as the driver needs to be vigilant for any sudden movements or doors opening from the parked vehicle.\n\nFurther ahead, there are multiple pedestrians crossing the street from right to left in front of the ego vehicle. These pedestrians have priority, as they are crossing at a designated crosswalk while the pedestrian signal is green, indicating that the ego car must wait for them to complete crossing safely.\n\nAdditionally, another pedestrian, holding an umbrella, is seen approaching the pedestrian crossing from the opposite side, implying that the ego car's driver should stay attentive to the potential of more pedestrians stepping onto the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic light facing the ego car displays a green light for vehicles while also showing a green walking signal for the pedestrians. Even though the green light would normally allow vehicles to drive through, the presence of the green walking signal means that vehicles must yield to the pedestrians currently crossing. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or any other notable objects in the image that need to be considered in the driving decision-making process."

It should not proceed until the pedestrian crossing is clear and it is safe to do so, despite having a green signal for vehicle movement. The driver must also monitor the parked vehicle for any signs of movement and be ready to yield in case a door opens or it begins to pull out of the spot."
