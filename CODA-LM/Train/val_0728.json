One silver van is observed parked on the left by the side of the road. Although it is stationary, there is a need to remain vigilant as the van could potentially move or a passenger might open a door, which could affect the driving path of the ego car.\n\nOn the road, there is also a motorized three-wheeled vehicle in the middle, facing the ego car but positioned slightly to the right. The ego car must be cautious around this vehicle since it may change direction or come to a stop, necessitating a possible slowdown or complete stop of the ego car to avoid a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians near the road; some are sheltered under an awning, and another is crossing the street further ahead to the right side. Since pedestrians could enter the driving lane at any moment, the ego car should be ready to yield or come to a halt to ensure their safety.\n\nThe right side of the road is busy with roadside stalls and miscellaneous objects indicating it is a populated area. The dense activity at the roadside suggests that pedestrians could unpredictably step onto the road, which requires the ego car to be on high alert to react promptly to any unforeseen pedestrian movements.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers mentioned in the data for the current traffic image. These categories can be disregarded in the driving scenario analysis."
