Ahead of the ego car, there are several vehicles moving in the same direction, which influence the flow of traffic and require the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly.\n\nOn the right edge of the road, there is a cyclist moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist necessitates that the ego car provides sufficient lateral space to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic lights ahead are displaying a red signal for the vehicles moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, indicating that the ego car must come to a complete stop.\n\nLastly, there is a trash bin positioned on the sidewalk to the right.
