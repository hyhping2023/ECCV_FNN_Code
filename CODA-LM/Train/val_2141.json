Additionally, several other vehicles are visible at a distance, scattered through nearby lanes with illuminated lights, indicating that it is either evening or nighttime. Continuous monitoring of these vehicles is needed as their actions can influence traffic flow and affect the ego vehicle's driving decisions.\n\nA pedestrian is seen on the right side of the street, close to parked vehicles but not attempting to cross. While this pedestrian is not on the road, their proximity means the ego vehicle must stay alert and be prepared to slow down or stop if the pedestrian steps into the driving lane.\n\nA directional sign is visible slightly to the left above the intersection, indicating lane directions for turns and straight movements. This sign provides crucial information for navigation decisions and preparing for turns. \n\nAt the intersection, the traffic light is showing a red signal, requiring all vehicles to stop. The ego vehicle must halt behind the mixer truck until the light turns green.\n\nFinally, there are multiple sources of light on both sides of the road from commercial or residential buildings. These lights enhance visibility but also introduce reflections or glare that need to be considered in the ego vehicle's environmental assessment."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It is large and equipped with a rotating drum used for mixing cement components, which is visible at the back of the vehicle. This type of truck is commonly used in construction sites for transporting mixed cement to areas where it is needed. For the ego car, the presence of such a construction vehicle on the road typically indicates potentially slower moving traffic ahead. The ego car might need to reduce speed and increase following distance, considering the size of the truck and its impact on visibility and road space. Safety measures such as these are essential to mitigate risks of collisions due to the larger blind spots and frequent stops usually associated with construction vehicles.",

When the light turns green, the ego car should proceed with caution, being prepared to overtake the concrete mixer truck if it remains stationary or is moving slowly, while also ensuring a safe lane change if necessary."
