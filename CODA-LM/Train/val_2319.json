These parked cars limit the available road space and may obscure pedestrians or other hazards, so the ego car should be cautious of doors opening or pedestrians stepping out between vehicles.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**: A group of pedestrians, including adults, a child, and a dog, are present. The pedestrians are on the sidewalk to the right of the ego vehicle, close to the parked cars, while the dog is near the curb on the left. Pedestrians and animals can be unpredictable, requiring the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down if they attempt to cross the road or enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**: There is a tall vertical sign next to the roadside with Chinese characters, resembling a directional or informational sign. Although the content is not in English, such signs typically do not directly impact driving unless indicating specific conditions or restrictions relevant to the ego vehicle.\n\n4. **Other Objects**: Several red and yellow commercial signs are located on the roadside to the right of the ego vehicle. These signs are not directly influencing driving decisions but may serve as a distraction. The driver should remain focused on the road and be mindful of the pedestrians near these signs."
