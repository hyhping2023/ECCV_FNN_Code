A white car is traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle but on the left side, which requires attention as there is potential for the vehicle to change lanes or adjust speed. Additionally, there is a blue pickup truck in the right lane, positioned at a further distance ahead of the ego vehicle. This truck is relevant for maintaining a safe following distance and anticipating any speed adjustments or lane changes that it might make.\n\nThere are also orange and white traffic cones positioned in the right lane, creating a taper to guide vehicles into the remaining lanes. These cones indicate a lane closure or roadworks ahead, necessitating a merge to the left if in the affected lane.\n\nFurthermore, a blue guardrail is present along the right side of the roadway. This barrier is important as it defines the boundary of the road, ensuring that the vehicle remains within the lane boundaries.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in this scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used to indicate areas where driving is prohibited or to delineate lanes during road construction or accidents. The bright orange color and white reflective stripes enhance its visibility, urging drivers to steer clear of a specific lane or area for safety reasons. Its presence in this context might indicate ongoing road construction or specific lane closures, influencing the ego vehicle to adjust its route or change lanes to avoid the designated area, thereby adhering to safety protocols and ensuring smooth traffic flow.",

Continue monitoring the road ahead for any additional road users, traffic signs, or changes in road conditions that could influence driving behavior. As the scene does not feature traffic lights or signs, the focus should be on dynamic obstacles such as the vehicles and static objects like the traffic cones and barriers."
