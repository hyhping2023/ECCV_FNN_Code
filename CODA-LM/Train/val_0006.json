Among the road users, there is a white van directly ahead in the center lane, positioned slightly to the right and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this van is critical for maintaining a safe distance and adjusting speed, given it can change pace or direction at any time. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in the opposite direction, divided by a median. While these vehicles pose a lower risk, they still require monitoring for unexpected movements such as potential turns that could cross the ego car's path.\n\nOn the periphery, cyclists are noticed on the bike lane to the right of the road, riding in the same direction as the ego car. These vulnerable road users are capable of unpredictably merging onto the road, necessitating vigilant speed and lane adjustment by the ego car to uphold safety.\n\nFor navigational cues and regulations, there are traffic signs present, including a roundabout ahead sign and directional signs which are vital for the ego car's lane choices and turning decisions. Moreover, a no parking and no stopping sign reinforces that the ego car is not allowed to stop in this zone.\n\nConcerning traffic light signals, the lanes utilized by the ego car are currently green, giving the go-ahead to continue movement through the intersection or enter the roundabout as long as the path remains clear.\n\nTo the side of the roadway, there are traffic cones placed near the turning lane, hinting at possible road work or the closure of the lane ahead, which commands increased vigilance and adaptability from the ego car to navigate changes or obstacles in its route.\n\nLastly, a median barrier exists to separate the opposite traffic lanes, offering a safety buffer against head-on accidents and guiding the ego car's lateral movement within its lane.\n\nThere are no other objects reported in the data, indicating no further elements needing consideration from the ego car at this moment."
