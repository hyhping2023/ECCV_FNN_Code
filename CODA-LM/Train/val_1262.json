This sign dictates the speed the ego car should maintain when approaching and passing through the area.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange and white traffic cones placed on the right side of the road that form a delineated path for vehicles. These cones indicate a change in the regular traffic pattern and potentially a narrowed space for vehicles to pass, necessitating careful navigation and speed reduction.\n\nA temporary blue and yellow striped barrier is also seen blocking off access to a segment of the road ahead on the right.
