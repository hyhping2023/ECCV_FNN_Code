This uncertainty requires the ego vehicle to approach the intersection with caution and be prepared to stop if the light is red.\n\nMoreover, there is a significant reflection on the windshield that obstructs part of the view.

Additionally, the ego vehicle should scan for pedestrians given the zebra crossing and reduce speed to allow for any unexpected obstructions or road users entering its path."
