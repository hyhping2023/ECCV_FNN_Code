Directly ahead in the center lane is a black SUV with no signals, which sets the pace for the ego car's speed and following distance. Also noted are multiple vehicles in the right-most lane, with a white van closest to the ego car moving straight; these vehicles could impact the ego car's lane choice and maneuverability.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users reported in the data.\n\nThe traffic signs visible impact driving decisions: a 'no entry' sign forbids access to the left-most lane, an 'only straight' sign guides the center lane movements, while the 'no parking' signs also post a speed limit of 40, imposing restrictions on the ego car's driving speed and allowed maneuvers.\n\nThe traffic light for the center lane where the ego car is located is green, indicating the car can proceed straight without stopping.\n\nTraffic cones on the left restrict the lane width for turning left, necessitating careful maneuvers if the ego car chooses that path. Similarly, barriers on the left side of the intersection accompany the cones, potentially limiting visibility or available space, again impacting the ego car's navigation if it opts for a left turn.\n\nLastly, a pedestrian crosswalk is marked on the road in front of the ego car, with no pedestrians currently visible. However, the ego car must stay vigilant and prepared to yield in case pedestrians approach the crosswalk."
