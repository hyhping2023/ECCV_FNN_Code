Firstly, a large yellow mobile crane is identified on the right side of the road. This crane is mounted on a truck chassis and is partially obstructing the lane. The substantial size and position of the crane necessitate that the ego car either changes lanes or adjusts its speed in order to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle.\n\nSecondly, further down the road on the right, there is a cyclist pedaling along the edge of the lane. The presence of this road user requires the ego car to exercise caution. The car must possibly reduce its speed to ensure that there is an adequate passing distance from the cyclist, thus guaranteeing the safety of both the cyclist and the occupants of the car.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would otherwise impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a large mobile crane mounted on a truck base. It is characterized by its yellow color and features such as outriggers and a multi-section extendable boom. In driving scenarios like the one depicted, such construction vehicles may occupy additional space due to their large size and could also be parked or operating by the roadside. This necessitates increased caution from the driver of the ego car, potentially requiring them to slow down, maintain a greater distance, or change lanes to safely navigate past the construction vehicle without causing a traffic hazard.",

If overtaking is not possible due to road conditions or oncoming traffic, the car should follow at a safe distance until it is possible to pass safely. Additionally, the car should be aware of the cyclist ahead and ensure a safe passing distance when overtaking. Continual monitoring of the environment for any changes in road conditions or the actions of the cyclist is crucial."
