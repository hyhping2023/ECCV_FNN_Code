It has a rotating drum, a ladder on the side, and a retracted chute. The truck's size and potential for sudden stops or turns, especially near construction sites, necessitate that the ego car maintain a safe following distance.\n  - Various passenger vehicles are in the adjacent lanes to the right of the ego car, some are moving in the same direction while others are stopped. The ego car should monitor these vehicles as they may change lanes or affect the traffic flow, requiring adjustments in speed or path.\n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n  - A pedestrian is visible in the distance, crossing the road from left to right in front of the stopped vehicles. The ego car must be prepared to stop or slow down if the pedestrian's path intersects with its own, and yield the right of way if necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - Directional signs on the right side of the intersection show the directions for straight and right-turn lanes. These signs help the ego car select the correct lane for its route and predict other vehicles' movements based on their lane choice.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A traffic light ahead of the concrete mixer truck shows a green signal for going straight or turning right. The green light indicates that it is legal for vehicles, including the ego car, to proceed through the intersection if it is safe.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - There are no visible objects like debris, dustbins, or other hazards on the road. This absence of hazards allows for more predictable driving conditions with fewer obstructions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a heavy construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It is characterized by its large rotating drum used to mix cement components together. In road traffic, this type of vehicle generally moves slower due to its heavy load and operational requirements. For the ego car, encountering such a vehicle may require increased caution and possibly altering speed or changing lanes to maintain safety and ensure adequate distance. This vehicle's presence in an urban or road construction setting might indicate nearby construction activity, which could involve sudden stops, making it important for the ego car to stay alert and possibly reduce speed.",

Monitor the pedestrian to ensure they are clear of the ego car's path before proceeding. Be aware of the movements of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes and be prepared for potential lane changes, especially near an intersection. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car can proceed, but the driver must ensure it is safe to do so and the intersection is clear of any road users."
