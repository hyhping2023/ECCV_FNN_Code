        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are several notable road users and traffic elements that affect driving behavior. Among the vehicles observed, there's a blue sedan parked on the right-hand side of the road before the crosswalk, potentially obstructing the view for the ego car and other road users. The ego car should maintain an appropriate distance to be prepared for any pedestrians that might emerge from around the parked vehicle. Additionally, there is a white SUV and a silver sedan in the opposite lane moving towards the ego vehicle. Oncoming traffic necessitates the ego car to stay alert and in its own lane while monitoring for any unexpected maneuvers from the opposing lane. On both sides of the street, various vehicles including a white van and multiple cars are parked, which narrows the usable road space and heightens the need for increased awareness of possible door openings or pedestrians.\n\nThere is a motorcyclist ahead in the same lane as the ego car, and due to the motorcycle's smaller size and potential for dynamic movement, the ego car must keep a safe following distance and be ready for any quick changes in the motorcyclist's behavior.\n\nA traffic aspect worth noting is the presence of overhead blue directional signs, which inform about lane usage and potential turns or exits, guiding the ego car in making lane selection decisions. Additionally, the traffic light visible in the distance is green, suggesting the ego car can continue driving, but with the caveat to stay vigilant for the light potentially changing and prepare to stop if necessary. \n\nThe last category with significant road users includes an array of motorcycles and bicycles parked on the right side of the road. These parked vehicles add complexity to the traffic environment, as they can conceal pedestrians and take up part of the road. It's essential for the ego car to drive cautiously and remain vigilant as it passes by these two-wheelers.\n\nIn this traffic image, there are no traffic cones or barriers to be taken into consideration."

However, when riding, mopeds are typically slower than cars and can maneuver unpredictably, often weaving between vehicles. Therefore, the ego car should remain vigilant for any potential movement of the moped merging or pulling out into the traffic flow, which may require the ego car to slow down or change lanes to maintain safety.",

Regular scans for pedestrians moving between parked vehicles should also be conducted."
