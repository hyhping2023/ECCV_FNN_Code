Firstly, there is a large white truck on the left side, occupying the lane next to the ego car and traveling in the same direction. The truck's size and position could potentially obscure the driver's field of view, so it's important to maintain a safe distance from it.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, there is a construction vehicle, possibly an excavator with extended hydraulic arms. Due to its complex machinery and slow movement, the ego car should keep a greater following distance as the construction vehicle may stop suddenly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lineup of cars in the right lane adjacent to the ego car, all moving in the same direction. This indicates heavy traffic, and the ego car should be prepared for the possibility of sudden braking or lane changes from these vehicles.\n\nAs for traffic signals, there is at least one traffic light visible ahead on the right side, which is currently green. This means that traffic is allowed to proceed, but given the dense traffic conditions, the ego car should stay alert to any changes in the flow of traffic or the traffic light itself.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Avoid abrupt lane changes and monitor the surrounding vehicles to anticipate their actions."
