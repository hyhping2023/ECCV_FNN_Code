However, there are orange and white traffic cones positioned on the left side of the road. These cones create a demarcation line, signaling that a section of the road is not available for vehicular traffic. The likely reason for the cones is either ongoing construction activity or a closed-off area for safety or maintenance work. Furthermore, blue fencing is installed on both sides of the road, delineating the boundary of a construction site that is adjacent to the roadway. The barriers are in place to prevent vehicles from entering the construction site and to protect pedestrians and workers from the hazards of traffic. There are no other objects noted in the image."

Its presence on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by indicating that there might be a reduction in the available driving space, or a complete obstruction ahead that requires the driver to slow down, be more observant, or potentially find an alternative route.",
