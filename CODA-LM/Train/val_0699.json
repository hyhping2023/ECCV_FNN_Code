These cones are used to signal and guide drivers away from potential hazards or to demarcate specific areas not to be accessed by vehicles temporarily. As a result, the future driving behavior of the ego car should include avoiding this area by steering clear of the cone, indicating a restricted or unsafe zone for driving.",

Ego vehicle drivers should be mindful to avoid it, as it implies a deviation or attention to specific driving conditions, potentially reducing speed or navigating around the cone safely.",
