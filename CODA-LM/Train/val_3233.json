This vehicle is crucial for the ego car's driving decisions as it dictates the speed and following distance.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: A series of traffic cones are placed on the right side of the lane, suggesting road work or lane narrowing ahead.

Its bright orange color and reflective stripes make it highly visible even in low light conditions, as depicted in the image. For drivers, this cone indicates that caution should be exercised and it may require them to steer slightly away from the usual path to avoid encroaching into a potentially hazardous or restricted area. Placed here, it serves to alert the driver of the approaching vehicle (ego car) to be aware of potential obstructions and prepare for possible alterations in the drivable surface ahead.",

The absence of visible traffic signs and lights requires the ego car to rely on road markings and the behavior of other road users to navigate safely."
