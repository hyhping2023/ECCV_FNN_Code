The size and location of the truck may block the ego car's view of the road ahead, which could hinder the ability to see and predict the actions of other road users. Additionally, a pedestrian crossing sign is present on the right side of the road, signaling the presence of a crossing area where the ego car should be ready to stop for pedestrians. Furthermore, there is a scooter rider to the right of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. The scooter rider's potential for instability and vulnerability necessitates that the ego car keeps a safe following distance and stays alert for any sudden movements the rider might make. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle known as a concrete mixer truck. It is identifiable by its rotated drum used to mix concrete components. As the drum typically rotates to keep the concrete in a usable condition, the presence of this vehicle indicates active or upcoming construction work nearby. For the ego vehicle, this suggests the need for increased caution due to potential changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures or reduced speed zones commonly associated near construction sites.",
