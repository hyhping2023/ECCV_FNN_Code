These vehicles are of various colors and models, including sedans and vans. The presence of these parked cars narrows the available lane for the ego car, which might influence maneuvering decisions, especially due to the possibility of doors opening unexpectedly or pedestrians emerging between the vehicles.\n\nSecondly, several moving vehicles are ahead of the ego car in the same lane, including a white car directly in its path. This moving traffic dictates the following speed and signals a possible need for lane changes if overtaking is to be considered.\n\nAdditionally, a directional signboard is visible in the distance on the right side of the road, positioned just above the line of parked cars. This sign might provide information about upcoming roadways, exits, or directions, which could influence navigation decisions for the ego car.\n\nMoreover, there are a series of small traffic cones or delineators on the edge of the road to the right, leading up to the parked cars. These markers may indicate a designated parking area or direct traffic away from the curb, signifying that the ego car should keep clear of that area and maintain a safe distance from the delineated edge.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

It is brightly colored, often in fluorescent shades combined with reflective strips to ensure high visibility. For the ego car, encountering a traffic cone suggests that caution should be exercised. The ego car may need to slow down, change lanes, or follow any specific instructions indicated by such cones to navigate safely through potentially hazardous or changing road conditions.",

Continue to monitor the road conditions and remaining within the lane to avoid the traffic delineators."
