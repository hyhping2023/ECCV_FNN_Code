However, there are vulnerable road users that need to be considered:\n\n1. There is a pedestrian walking in the middle of the road wearing dark clothing, heading away from the ego car. The pedestrian's presence and unpredictable movement are potential hazards. This requires the ego car to remain cautious and ready to stop if necessary to ensure safety.\n\n2. Additionally, there is a white dog on the left edge of the road facing towards the ego car. As animals can be unpredictable, there's a risk that the dog might enter the roadway suddenly. The autonomous system in the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop to prevent a possible collision in such an event."
