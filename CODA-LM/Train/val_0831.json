Due to its size and the possible slow movement which is characteristic of heavy vehicles, it can influence the flow of surrounding traffic and requires careful consideration regarding any overtaking maneuvers that the autonomous vehicle might contemplate. No other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects are present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a commercial vehicle specifically designed for transporting goods, commonly referred to as a truck. In this scenario, it appears to be a flatbed trailer type, typically used for carrying other vehicles or heavy equipment. The presence of this truck on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by potentially requiring adjustments in speed and following distance. Since trucks like this one can obscure the drivers view of the road ahead and may make sudden stops or slow down for loading and unloading, maintaining a safe distance is crucial. Additionally, the width and length of the truck may affect maneuverability and lane choice for the ego car.",
