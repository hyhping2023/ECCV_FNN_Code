The position of this stationary vehicle may reduce the available driving space for the ego vehicle.

This requires the ego vehicle to monitor their movement and maintain a safe distance for passing. Furthermore, pedestrians are seen crossing the road at the marked crosswalk ahead, meaning vehicles, including the ego vehicle, must yield until the crosswalk is clear of pedestrians. Another pedestrian is spotted on the sidewalk to the right, necessitating remain alert for any unexpected road entry.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign visible to the right of the road serves as a warning for drivers, including the ego vehicle, to watch for pedestrians and yield the right of way.\n\nTraffic cones are noticed, arranged in a line along the right side of the rightmost lane approaching the intersection, pointing towards potential road work or hazards, and implying that vehicles should keep clear of the lane adjacent to the cones.\n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in the traffic image that would affect driving behavior."
