Foremost, there is a large gray cargo truck with the license plate partly visible as 'A.5E335' occupying the center lane directly ahead of the ego vehicle. Due to its size and close proximity, visibility of the road ahead might be hindered, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintain a safe distance to allow sufficient reaction time should the truck slow down or stop abruptly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dark sedan slightly ahead in the adjacent lane to the left of the ego vehicle. This sedan's position, being beside the ego vehicle, mandates monitoring in case it decides to change lanes or merge into the ego vehicle’s lane.\n\nRed-and-white traffic cones are placed on the left side of the ego vehicle’s lane, marking the edge of the lane, which either narrows the lane or indicates potential road work ahead. These cones are guiding traffic and cautioning the driver to stay within the constricted lane boundaries.\n\nFinally, a continuous green barrier is present on the right side of the road, serving as a boundary that separates the highway from the adjacent area. This barrier signifies the clear limits of the drivable roadway and must be noted to avoid any potential collisions."
