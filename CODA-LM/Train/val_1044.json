It appears to be stationary and does not seem to be preparing to enter the roadway at the moment. This vehicle is not expected to directly influence the driving decisions of the ego car but should be monitored for any signs of movement or disembarking passengers.\n\n2. **Barriers**: A continuous metal fence is present along the right side of the road, creating a separation between the sidewalk and the driving lane. This barrier defines the boundary of the driving space, constraining the ego car to the left side of the road and serving as an indicator to anticipate possible pedestrian movements into the driving lane.\n\n3. **Other Objects**: There are patches of snow visible on the sidewalks and close to the edge of the roadway, indicative of recent snowfall or persistent cold temperatures. These conditions suggest an increased likelihood of encountering black ice or slippery spots on the road, which could affect the vehicleâ€™s control and stopping distance."
