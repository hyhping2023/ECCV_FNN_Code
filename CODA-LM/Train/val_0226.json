There is a black sedan moving forward directly ahead of the ego car, which affects the vehicle's speed and following distance. In addition, a white car is positioned to the right and slightly ahead, also moving forward; it does not pose an immediate threat but should be kept under observation in case it decides to change lanes. Likewise, on the left and slightly ahead, there is a silver car, which is traveling in an adjacent lane and also requires attention for potential lane changing maneuvers.\n\nThe traffic infrastructure is marked by a green traffic light visible at a distance, signaling that it is permissible for the ego car to continue driving through the intersection without interruption. Meanwhile, the lanes are delimited by multiple traffic cones that are set up to create a narrow passage, which requires the ego car to navigate cautiously to avoid any collisions. Additionally, there are temporary barriers located on the right side of the road, indicating a construction or maintenance area; these necessitate that the ego car maintains its course within the lane limits to ensure safety.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other miscellaneous objects are present in the traffic image, and therefore, there are no associated impacts on the ego car from these categories."
