        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, I observe several road users and objects. To begin with, there is a white truck parked on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the curb-side lane. This is significant because the truck's position might diminish the width of the road that is safely navigable for our autonomous vehicle, or the 'ego car'. Further along the right side of the road are multiple cars parked at a distance, with one notably closer to the lane of the ego car. This proximity of the parked cars to the ego car's travel lane serves to condense the drivable space, necessitating that the ego car adjusts its position more towards the left to avert any potential conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, in front of the parked truck on the right side, there are white and red striped barriers installed. The presence of these barriers typically denotes that roadwork is in progress or there is an unexpected obstacle ahead. Consequently, they serve as a caution for the ego car to potentially lower its speed and be ready to make a full stop if necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other notable objects present in this specific traffic image that would influence the ego car's driving behavior. Hence, our focus remains on the parked vehicles and the barriers as key factors in this driving scenario."
