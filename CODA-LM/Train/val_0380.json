It's important to consider that these vehicles might slow down or shift lanes, potentially requiring the ego car to adjust its speed and lane position to maintain safe travel distances.\n\nAdding to the scene, there is a blue circular traffic sign with a white arrow curved upwards to the right, signaling an upcoming right bend in the road. The ego car should prepare to navigate the curve safely as indicated by the sign.\n\nAlso visible is a green traffic light directly ahead, allowing the ego car to proceed. However, vigilance is necessary as the traffic light could change, necessitating a response from the ego car.\n\nOn the right lane, orange traffic cones are set up from the foreground, extending towards the curve beneath the overpass, effectively narrowing the lane. This indicates that the ego car should stay in the left lane to avoid potential road work or obstructions that the cones are marking.\n\nLastly, there are barriers with yellow and black stripes on both sides of the road beneath the overpasses, marking restricted areas. These barriers are guiding the traffic, demonstrating that the sides of the road are off-limits to vehicular traffic.\n\nNo vulnerable road users or other objects are present in this traffic image."
