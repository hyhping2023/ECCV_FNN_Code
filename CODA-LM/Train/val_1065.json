This large vehicle necessitates caution due to its wider turning radius, blind spots, and its potential to obscure road hazards or other vehicles. Additionally, there is a white sedan directly in front of the ego vehicle in the same lane. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance as sudden stops or changes in the sedan's speed could require immediate action. Moreover, a car is observed on the adjacent right lane, driving parallel and in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to exercise caution when considering a lane change to the right.\n\nFor traffic signals, an overhead traffic signal is not clearly visible in the image due to the distance and angle. The indiscernibility of this traffic light should prompt the ego car to approach with caution and be prepared to stop in case the signal changes to yellow or red.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

Given the bulky size and specialized function of this vehicle, it usually moves slower than typical traffic flow. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or slow movement from this vehicle.

The presence of multiple vehicles in adjacent lanes means the ego vehicle should refrain from making lane changes unless necessary and with ample safety margins. The status of the overhead traffic signals should be monitored closely as the vehicle approaches the intersection, prepared to stop if needed. Keep speed moderated to ensure safe braking and reaction times."
