        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of notable elements that the autonomous driving system must consider. Firstly, there is a green truck with a loading crane attached, stopped in the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle. This truck is obstructing part of the roadway, suggesting there might be construction or loading activity taking place, which could lead to unexpected stops or a slower traffic flow. Additionally, there is a smaller, light-colored vehicle on the left side, which is moving away from the ego vehicle's path. While this vehicle isn't directly affecting the ego vehicle's immediate movements, it's important to keep an eye on it in case it changes direction or comes to a stop.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones set up in front of the green truck, marking a work zone or an area that should be avoided by vehicles. These cones serve as a warning that the ego vehicle should not drive straight ahead through the lane where the cones and the truck are positioned, indicating a need to find an alternative route.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Caution should be maintained for any other road workers or signs that may be present in the vicinity of the truck but not visible in this image."
