A white pickup truck is positioned on the left side, next to the sidewalk in what seems to be a loading area. While it is stationary and not directly in the ego car's lane, its proximity to the traffic means its actions should be carefully monitored.\n2. A dark-colored sedan is traveling ahead of the ego car, in the same lane. This vehicle directly influences the ego car's speed and following distance as it is a moving object in the car's path.\n3. Further ahead, a truck is also seen moving in the same direction as the ego car. Large vehicles like this impact visibility and traffic flow, requiring the ego car to maintain a greater following distance for safety.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. On the right side of the image, a motorcyclist is riding in the same direction as the ego vehicle but is along the side of the road. The potential for the motorcyclist to enter into the main traffic flow makes it necessary for the ego vehicle to anticipate and adjust accordingly.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. There are directional signs above the sidewalk to the left, which provide information regarding directions and nearby facilities. They are not immediate factors for driving decisions but are useful for navigation and route planning.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. Directly ahead, two green arrow lights are signaling that the ego vehicle's lane has the go-ahead to proceed straight. This clear instruction indicates that the ego car should continue moving forward.\n\nBarriers:\n1. Along the median strip, separating the opposite lanes of traffic, there are barriers consisting of yellow and black striped poles and red and white striped barrels. They serve both as visual guides and as physical preventatives to vehicles crossing into oncoming lanes, reinforcing the direction of travel.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving behavior."
