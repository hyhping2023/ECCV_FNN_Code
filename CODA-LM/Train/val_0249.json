A blue SUV across the intersection making a left turn, which may require the ego car to yield depending on the traffic light status and right-of-way rules.\n3. Various vehicles ahead on the road and in the opposite lane, moving in their respective directions. The ego car must observe traffic flow for potential lane changes and speed adjustments.\n\nTraffic signs observed include:\n1. A road sign to the right indicating a left-turn lane ahead, suggesting that the ego car should stay in the appropriate lane if it intends to go straight and should be mindful of vehicles merging for the left turn.\n2. A circular no parking sign to the right, adjacent to the road, which is irrelevant to immediate driving decisions but informs the ego car about parking restrictions in the area.\n\nThe current frame does not show a visible traffic light, so the ego car should approach the intersection with caution and be prepared to respond to the eventual sight of a traffic signal.\n\nThere are yellow and orange traffic cones dividing a construction zone on the right side of the road.
