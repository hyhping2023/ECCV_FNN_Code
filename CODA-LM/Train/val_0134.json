On the right side, in the same lane as the ego car, there is a white car ahead and parallel to it, potentially affecting the ego car's speed adjustment and following distance. Additionally, there are a few vehicles traveling in the same direction as the ego car, located beyond the intersection, which will impact the ego car's speed control and following distance after crossing the intersection.\n\nFor navigation, there are overhead directional signs that provide lane assignments for upcoming intersections and turns, which will help the ego car position itself correctly for its intended maneuvers. The traffic lights at the intersection are green, indicating that the ego car can proceed, but with caution.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are orange traffic cones demarcating an area likely under construction or repair, suggesting that the ego car should avoid the edge of the road and be vigilant for potential obstacles or workers. Alongside the pedestrian crossing area, near the traffic cones, there are barrier poles that reinforce the boundary of the construction or repair area, signaling the ego car to maintain a safe distance from this zone."
