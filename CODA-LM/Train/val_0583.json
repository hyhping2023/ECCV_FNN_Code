        "description and explanation": "In the image, there is a white sedan parked on the left side of the road facing away from the ego vehicle. It doesn't present an immediate threat, but it does limit the usable road space, requiring careful driving from the autonomous vehicle. Additionally, there's a row of vehicles lined up along the same side, further narrowing the passage and obligating the ego vehicle to navigate the reduced roadway without deviation.\n\nTwo pedestrians are also observed in the road ahead, near the centerline. One of them is holding a camera, which suggests they may be a traffic reporter or photographer. Their presence in the roadway necessitates a considerable decrease in speed and a readiness to come to a complete stop.\n\nFurthermore, there's a blue traffic sign displaying a white pedestrian symbol, signaling a pedestrian crossing ahead on the left side. This alerts the ego vehicle to the likelihood of pedestrian movement ahead, warranting additional caution.\n\nRed and white traffic cones have been arranged to delineate the pedestrian area on the left, effectively directing vehicles away from that space. These cones serve to guide the flow of traffic and mark the boundaries that vehicles should not traverse.\n\nLastly, there are groups of people gathered on both sides of the road, possibly due to a public event or incident. This could lead to distractions or sudden pedestrian movements onto the road, requiring the autonomous driving system to stay alert for new potential hazards."

No sudden movements should be made that could surprise the pedestrians or other road users. Communication with pedestrians using vehicle signals like hazard lights may be appropriate to ensure safety for all parties involved."
