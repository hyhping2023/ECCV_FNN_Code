Additionally, there are no visible traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones. However, there is a white boom barrier with red stripes in the lowered position, effectively blocking the road ahead. The barrier implies that access is restricted, and vehicles can only continue after obtaining the proper authorization or when the barrier is lifted. To the right of the road, beside the barrier, there is a security guard booth. The security booth's location indicates that there might be a need to stop and engage with security personnel for access, reinforcing the controlled nature of this area."

It is part of a gate that either slides or lifts to allow vehicles and pedestrians through after determining access permissions. In the context of driving, the presence of this barrier indicates that the area ahead may require authorization for entry, and the ego car must prepare to stop and possibly communicate with security or operate a control mechanism to gain access.",
