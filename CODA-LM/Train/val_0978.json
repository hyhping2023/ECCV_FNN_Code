There is a presence of large industrial spools located by the side of the road, adjacent to a building. The spools seem to be stationary and do not pose an immediate threat to road users. However, given their close proximity to the roadway, drivers should act with caution. There is a potential risk for these objects to unexpectedly move onto the road, which would necessitate evasive maneuvers to avoid an incident. It is imperative to remain vigilant and prepare for any unforeseen obstacles while driving near this area. All the other categories such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers have no listed items, indicating their absence in the traffic scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large industrial cable reel, typically used for storing and transporting substantial lengths of cable or wire. Its significant size and the presence of multiple cable reels suggest a storage or deployment area for industrial supplies. In a driving scenario, encountering such objects alongside the road could indicate an industrial area or construction site nearby. Drivers should be cautious of potential hazards or heavy vehicle movement in such areas, which may influence changes in speed or increased alertness while driving.",

These spools are made from a sturdy material, possibly wood or metal, and feature a cylindrical center with two large discs at each end. In a driving scenario, such objects are likely to be stationary and positioned off the roadway as part of industrial or construction storage. While they do not directly influence the driving path under normal circumstances, their presence could indicate industrial activity nearby which may include the entry and exit of heavy vehicles or temporary obstructions. Drivers should remain alert to such possibilities and adjust their driving behavior accordingly to ensure safety.",
