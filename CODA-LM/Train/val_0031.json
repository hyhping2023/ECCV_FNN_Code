Several vehicles are occupying the adjacent lanes to the left, each varying in distance and speed relative to the ego car.

A bus is positioned on the right side of an upcoming intersection, likely in a bus lane or preparing to stop. This bus may impact pedestrian behavior and obscure potential hazards.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. Cyclists are riding along the right side of the ego car's lane. The ego car needs to slow down or change lanes to ensure a safe passing distance.\n2. Pedestrians are crossing the road at various points to the ego car's right. They need careful monitoring as they may step into the vehicleâ€™s path.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. Directional signs are visible above the intersection, indicating the appropriate lanes for going straight or making turns. These signs guide the ego car on the correct lanes for its intended maneuvers.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n1. Visible straight ahead are a green traffic light for going straight and a green arrow for turning left. These signals permit the ego car to proceed cautiously based on its travel direction.\n\n**Barriers:**\n1. A temporary barrier is positioned on the right side of the rightmost lane, possibly signaling construction or lane closure. This may disrupt traffic flow and necessitate a lane change.\n\nThere are no observed traffic cones or other objects in the image that need to be reported."
