A mandatory direction sign on the left indicates a left turn, which the ego car must follow, preparing to make that turn.\n2. A blue sign with a red cross, positioned over the right lane, indicates no stopping or parking, informing the ego car that stopping or parking in the right lane is prohibited and that it should keep moving or find a legal parking spot elsewhere.\n3. A height restriction sign showing 2.8 meters, positioned under an overhead structure, which is important for large vehicles such as trucks or buses to note.\n\nA single traffic cone is positioned on the right side of the road, suggesting a potential hazard or road work on that side, requiring the car to proceed with caution and give it a wide berth.\n\nMetal barriers line the pedestrian area on the left side of the road, separating the roadway from the pedestrian area, indicating that the car should not expect pedestrian crossings from that side and can maintain a safe distance from the barrier.\n\nAdditionally, bicycles are parked on the right side next to the standing cyclist. These do not obstruct the roadway but should be noted in case someone approaches to use one of the bicycles, which could affect the road situation."
