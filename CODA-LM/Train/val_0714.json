The presence and size of the truck may reduce visibility for the ego car and necessitate maintaining a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic lights in the image are green, signaling that the ego car is allowed to proceed. However, even with the right of way, the ego car should remain cautious due to the potential presence of other road users.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are red and white traffic cones, suggesting that there is a closed lane or ongoing roadwork. These cones indicate that the drivable area of the road is reduced, and vehicles should stay to the left to avoid the affected area.\n\nFurthermore, there are temporary barriers also on the right side of the road, reinforcing the message of the traffic cones by indicating a lane closure or roadwork. These barriers serve as an instruction for drivers to avoid the right lane and merge left if necessary to continue safely."

Continue driving in the left lane due to the right lane being closed off by traffic cones and barriers.

Since the traffic lights are green, there's no need to slow down unless road conditions or other road users require it."
