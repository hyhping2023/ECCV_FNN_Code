The worker's close presence to the traffic lane poses a potential safety hazard, as they might unexpectedly enter the road. This necessitates caution and readiness to stop from the ego car.\n\nThere are also possible barriers or construction on the right side where the worker is standing, partly obscured from view. The presence of construction or barriers indicates a potential road obstruction that the ego car may need to navigate around carefully.\n\nFurthermore, the image shows reflections and glare from lights on wet surfaces, indicating that it might be raining or the road might be wet. Wet roads reduce tire traction and increase stopping distances, so the ego car will need to adjust its driving behavior to these conditions to maintain safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in the image."
