The truck's size and heavy load imply it may travel at a slower pace and need extra distance for stopping, which necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance for any unexpected braking or turns. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles parallel parked on the right side of the road. The parked vehicles constrict the navigable lane space, thus the ego car must drive carefully past them to evade any potential accidents.\n\nFurthermore, there's a No Entry sign on the roadside ahead, which signifies that the road is not open to the ego vehicle, and a change in the planned route may be required. Meanwhile, the traffic lights visible in the image are green, allowing the ego car to proceed. Nevertheless, the driver should stay vigilant for the possibility of the signal turning yellow and be prepared to halt if the situation calls for it.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image, indicating these categories do not need to be considered for driving decisions at this moment."

Such vehicles tend to move slower due to their heavy load and large size, which may influence the driving behavior of the ego car. An appropriate response would be to maintain a safe following distance, anticipate slower speeds especially when these vehicles are entering or exiting construction sites, and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced lane availability due to the size of the vehicle.",
