It is yellow and has equipment extending upwards, likely indicating it is a crane or mobile platform. This vehicle's size and equipment may restrict visibility and maneuverability, requiring the ego car to maintain increased stopping distance and drive cautiously. Additionally, there is a yellow sedan to the left of the ego car in an adjacent lane, slightly ahead. This sedan's position and proximity could interfere with the ego car's ability to change lanes or adjust speed to ensure a safe following distance.\n\nThere are two pedestrians standing at a bus stop on the right side of the road; one is wearing a blue top, and the other a yellow jacket. Their proximity to the roadway necessitates that the ego car be prepared to stop or slow down if they unexpectedly move into the road.\n\nWhite fencing is present on the right side of the road, indicating a boundary or closed area. These barriers can signal changes in road layouts, closed lanes, or areas where pedestrians might be present, requiring the ego car to be more attentive and reduce speed."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, identifiable by its robust structure and the presence of equipment like what appears to be a hoisting arm or crane on its top. These vehicles are commonly used in construction areas for various tasks such as transporting or moving heavy materials like dirt or construction equipment. In driving scenarios, encountering a construction vehicle like this one on the road suggests that there might be construction activity nearby. It calls for increased caution from the ego car, potentially reduced speeds, and readiness to comply with modified traffic patterns or instructions from construction site workers. Driving behavior should be adjusted accordingly to maintain safety and respond to possible changes or disruptions in the usual traffic flow.",
