        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects that the autonomous driving system needs to consider. Firstly, there is a white van parked on the side of the street. While this van does not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle, caution is advised when passing it. The presence of the van may obscure obstacles, including pedestrians, which could suddenly emerge into the path of the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a dog has been spotted walking on the street. This animal represents a potential hazard. Animals, including dogs, can be unpredictable in their movements and may enter the driving lane unexpectedly. Therefore, it is important for the autonomous driving system to detect the dog early and slow down or adjust the path as necessary to ensure safety.\n\nLastly, there are green garbage bins located on the side of the street. These bins are identified as potential obstacles. The ego vehicle should be programmed to recognize such stationary objects and maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions or scraping against them.\n\nThe traffic image lacks any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, indicating that these elements do not influence the current driving scenario. The focus for the autonomous vehicle, in this case, is on navigating safely around the mentioned parked vehicle, the dog, and garbage bins, while staying alert for any unforeseen movements or obstructions that could emerge from the blind spots created by these objects."
