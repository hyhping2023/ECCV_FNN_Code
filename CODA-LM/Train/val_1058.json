This large vehicle limits the ability of the ego car to maneuver or change lanes to the right if necessary. Ahead in the same lane as the ego car, there is a cyclist moving away from the vehicle. The presence of the cyclist dictates the traveling speed of the ego car in its current lane, and any overtaking maneuvers must be conducted with caution to ensure the safety of the cyclist.\n\nOverhead, there are directional signs that provide guidance on lane directions and the availability of turns. These signs are crucial for the ego car to identify the correct lane to follow for its intended route. Additionally, there is a traffic light situated ahead to the left, which is currently green. The green signal grants the ego car and other road users the right of way to proceed forward or to make any maneuvers that are permitted by the traffic light.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that could impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

This vehicle is mounted on a truck bed and features a large, extendable boom arm used for hoisting materials. Due to its size and the operational nature, this vehicle typically moves slowly and requires extra space for maneuvering. Its presence suggests construction activity in the vicinity which could lead to potential delays, detours, or temporary road closures in the area. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, it is crucial to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle, reduce speed, and be prepared for unexpected stops or directional changes.",
