        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects that influence the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, or ego car, as follows:\n\nThe vehicles observed include a white car parked on the side of the road, on the right side of the ego vehicle's direction of travel. Although the parked car is not in the driving lane, it necessitates caution since there's a possibility of a door opening or a pedestrian emerging unexpectedly from in front or behind the car. Additionally, various cars are parked at a distance on the right side of the street. While they are not an immediate threat, they require attention for comprehensive situational awareness. A white delivery truck is parked on the left side, near a storefront, and positioned perpendicularly to the driving direction. This truck could be hazardous if it moves unpredictably or pedestrians navigate around it and into the road.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, pedestrians who might be obscured by the delivery truck on the left side are noted. Their unpredictable movements could lead them to step onto the street, demanding cautious driving near the truck area. Also, a cyclist is spotted appearing behind the parked delivery truck, moving parallel to the direction of the ego car. The possibility of the cyclist entering into the traffic flow warrants monitoring until they are either integrated safely within vehicular traffic or remain off the road.\n\nThe scene includes concrete barriers or posts on the right side of the road. These barriers delineate the separation between the roadway and the pedestrian walkway, serving as an indication of where the driving space is confined and caution is advised.\n\nAn additional note is made of a small white dog on the left side of the road. The dog is not restrained and could move unpredictably across the road, representing a potential hazard that requires the ego vehicle to be ready to reduce speed or stop if necessary.\n\nThe absence of traffic signs, traffic lights, and traffic cones indicates that these categories do not feature in this specific traffic scenario and thus do not directly impact the driving behavior in the observed image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a dog. Dogs can be unpredictable in traffic situations, potentially entering the roadway without warning. The presence of a dog near the roadway requires that the driver of the ego vehicle be especially alert and ready to slow down or stop to avoid a collision, thereby ensuring the safety of all road users, including the animal. This factor could likely influence the driver to approach with increased caution, possibly reducing the vehicle's speed as a preventive measure.",

Keep a safe distance from the parked vehicles on the right and monitor the cyclist to ensure they do not enter the road unexpectedly."
