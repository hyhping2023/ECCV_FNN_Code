It is crucial for the autonomous driving system to monitor this car even though it's currently not an immediate threat, as it could move unexpectedly and potentially impact the path of the ego car.\n\nOverhead, there is a directional sign indicating that there's a left turn ahead. For the autonomous navigation system, this information will be essential if the intended route involves making that left turn.\n\nAlso, there is a sequence of orange and white traffic cones neatly lined up, delineating a construction area on the left side of the road from the active driving lane. It's imperative for the ego car to heed this indication and stay within the open lane to the right to ensure a safe passage around the roadwork.\n\nLastly, an unidentified black object on the ground to the right side of the road is observed. While the nature of the object is not known, it could be potentially hazardous debris. The autonomous driving system must be prepared to circumnavigate this object, by steering slightly to the left if necessary, to prevent any damage to the vehicle.\n\nThe JSON data does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers in this image, suggesting that there are none present within the scene."

This cone is placed on the road itself, slightly to the right side relative to the ego car's lane. This indicates a likely obstruction or hazard ahead, perhaps suggesting an area where road work is being conducted or an obstacle is present. As a result, the future driving behavior for the ego car should involve reducing speed and preparing to possibly change lanes or maneuver carefully around the cone to avoid any potential hazards associated with the marked area.",
