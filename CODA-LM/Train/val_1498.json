        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two notable road users. Firstly, there is a tricycle fitted with a cargo container at the rear, which is situated directly ahead within the same lane as the ego car. The presence of the tricycle is significant to the autonomous driving system of the ego vehicle due to the fact that it travels at a slower speed compared to the usual vehicle traffic. As a result, this could affect the flow of traffic, meaning the autonomous car might need to alter its speed or switch lanes to maintain a smooth travel path.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is spotted standing near the tricycle, specifically on the right side of the road. It seems like the pedestrian is either interacting with the tricycle operator or getting ready to cross the street. The autonomous vehicle must monitor the pedestrian closely because there exists a possibility of sudden or unexpected movement into the roadway. Thus, the car needs to be ready to execute appropriate maneuvers to ensure continued safety on the road."

It typically provides stability compared to two-wheeled bicycles and can be used for carrying additional cargo or passengers. In the driving scenario, the presence of a tricycle could influence the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring more cautious maneuvers, especially when overtaking, to ensure safe passage without causing any risk to the tricycle rider.",

Mopeds are generally smaller than motorcycles and have an engine capacity and maximum speed lower than those of motorcycles, making them ideal for city use. The presence of a moped in traffic necessitates careful attention from the ego car's driver, as mopeds can accelerate and maneuver quickly, sometimes appearing unpredictably from blind spots.",
