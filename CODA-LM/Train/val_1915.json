The size and proximity of this truck are critical as they affect our ability to maneuver and require us to maintain a safe following distance. Above the lane, there is a traffic sign with a red border and white background showing the number 4 inside a red prohibited symbol, indicating that there is a height restriction ahead which must be observed to avoid any collisions with the structure above.\n\nAdditionally, there is a sign with directional arrows on a blue background, situated on a pillar to the right of the road. This sign suggests that there might be a merging lane ahead or a choice in travel direction, which means our vehicle should be alert for potential merging traffic from the right side.\n\nOn the right side of the lane, orange traffic cones have been set up, signaling a closed-off area or a section to be approached with caution. These cones may point to road works or various obstacles, guiding our vehicle to keep away from the right side and be prepared for a possible narrowing of the driveable road space.\n\nLastly, scattered on the right side of the road, there are assorted items including a yellow bucket and some debris. These objects could pose a hazard if they were to move onto the roadway, and thus should be carefully watched."
