This setup poses a risk of sudden movement either from the vehicle itself or the boom, which could obstruct the ego vehicle's path or create debris.\n  - A small white truck is facing the ego vehicle on the right side of the road with its rear facing the ego vehicle. Although stationary, its location could potentially restrict the ego vehicle's movement if it makes any unexpected maneuvers.\n  - A small car is located on the bottom left side of the image, positioned parallel to the ego vehicle. The car's close proximity could limit the ego vehicle's maneuverability if the car were to suddenly enter its lane.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - A construction barrier is present on the right, partly obstructing the parking area and leading to potential road debris. This barrier indicates ongoing construction work, which may cause obstructions or changing road conditions that the ego vehicle needs to navigate around.\n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects were observed in the image."

            "description and explanation": "The object is labeled as 'construction' and appears to be a sloped area with exposed earth, possibly undergoing excavation or stabilization as part of a construction project. This area is likely influencing the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring a reduction in speed and increased caution due to the potential for debris or construction equipment entering the roadway. The presence of construction may also indicate temporary traffic signs or altered traffic patterns, necessitating alert and cautious driving.",

It should be prepared to stop or maneuver carefully to avoid any hazards from the construction area and watch for any unexpected movements from the parked vehicles, especially considering the unstructured nature of the parking area. Maintaining a safe distance from the stationary vehicles and the barrier is advised."
