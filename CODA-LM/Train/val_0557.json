Additionally, there are various vehicles parked on the side of the road to the left, mixed with moving traffic. These parked vehicles could affect the drivable space and potential moving patterns of the ego car, as parked vehicles might open doors or pull out into traffic unexpectedly.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there are pedestrians, some of whom are close to the curb. The proximity of these pedestrians to the road means that the ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop should any of them enter the road.\n\nA traffic sign is present on the left-hand side of the road, specifically a No U-turn sign attached to a portable stand. This sign informs the ego car that U-turns are not permitted at this location, which affects the possible maneuver choices the driver can make.\n\nThere are also orange traffic cones positioned on the left-hand side of the road, indicating a delineated area. These cones may signify a hazard or roadwork, prompting the ego car to potentially change lanes or reduce speed if necessary.\n\nLastly, there is a blue tent and booth set up on the right sidewalk, which could be related to some event or work. The activity near the tent may influence pedestrian movement, necessitating additional vigilance from the ego car to accommodate any unexpected pedestrian actions.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or barriers present in the image, as indicated by the empty categories in the JSON data."
