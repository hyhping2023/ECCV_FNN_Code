A silver SUV is parked on the left side of the road, facing the ego car but at a safe distance ahead. Although the SUV is not an immediate threat, it should be kept under observation in case it starts to move. On the right, a maroon sedan is traveling in the opposite direction, which does not impede the ego car's path, but it is important to remain aware of oncoming traffic. Further ahead on the right, there is a white van that seems to be either slowing down or parked with its rear doors facing the ego car, which could potentially block the lane if it is indeed parked, requiring the ego car to change lanes or adjust speed when approaching. Additionally, there are several cars parked on both sides of the street, which narrows the drivable roadway and necessitates cautious navigation to avoid any sudden movements from the parked vehicles or pedestrians that may emerge.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there is a group of pedestrians crossing the street from the left to the right in front of the ego car, including one with a dog. The ego car will need to slow down or stop to allow them to cross safely, as they have the right of way. Cyclists are also present, riding along the side of the road on the right and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car must provide ample space when overtaking the cyclists to ensure their safety, which may involve changing lanes.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

Monitor the white van for any signs of movement to anticipate potential road sharing or lane changing. The oncoming maroon sedan is in the opposite lane and should be monitored but does not pose an immediate concern."
