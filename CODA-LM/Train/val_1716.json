The vehicle is slightly positioned to the right within the lane. This vehicle may present a potential hazard due to its slower acceleration, limited visibility, and the possibility of making unexpected maneuvers. Its size could also obscure road signs or other road users that are ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large blank billboard sign parallel to the road on the right side. Although it is not currently displaying any traffic instructions and does not influence driving behavior, it has the potential to provide traffic-related messages in the future.\n\nFurthermore, a series of barriers and construction equipment are present on the right side of the road, indicating that there is a construction zone nearby. These barriers suggest that there may be construction activity that could affect lane availability and traffic flow, requiring caution when driving in this area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."
