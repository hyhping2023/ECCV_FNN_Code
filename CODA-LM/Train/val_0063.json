This might require the ego vehicle to prepare for potential maneuvers, either to access the parking or to remain vigilant for other vehicles that could be entering or exiting the parking zone.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead displaying a green light, which means the ego vehicle is permitted to continue its journey without interruption. Still, caution is advised in anticipation of the light possibly changing to yellow or red.\n\nTraffic cones have been set up on the right side of the road, resulting in a narrowed driving lane that may need the ego vehicle to merge to the left or reduce speed for safe passage.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects noted in the image that would affect navigation or driving behavior for the ego vehicle."
