This indicates that the area might experience high traffic, necessitating increased vigilance from the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to avoid collisions. Additionally, there's a set of metal barriers or fences lining the sidewalk, which serves to clearly delineate the pedestrian area from the roadway. This means the ego car must stay within its traffic lane and not infringe upon the pedestrian zone. Lastly, the backdrop includes trees and buildings, hinting at an urban setting, where heightened alertness is advised due to possible pedestrian movement or the presence of other road users, although these elements don't directly influence driving behavior."

Pedestrians are very important factors to consider in traffic management, as their presence near roadways necessitates cautious driving behavior. In this scenario, the future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a vigilant awareness of the pedestrian's actions, especially in case the pedestrian decides to cross the street or move in closer proximity to the road. This vigilance helps in preventing accidents and ensures the safety of both pedestrians and vehicle occupants.",
