The first vehicle is a white passenger vehicle parked on the side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. This parked vehicle occupies part of the road, which reduces the available space for the ego car to maneuver. As a result, the ego car should exercise caution and maintain a safe distance when passing it.\n\nThe second vehicle is a tractor or farming vehicle on the road, facing the opposite direction of the ego car. The tractor is a large, slow-moving vehicle that could obstruct the ego car's path. Therefore, the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop and pass the tractor with caution when it is safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dilapidated or abandoned structure or shed visible on the side of the road. While this structure does not directly impact the ego car's path, its presence indicates a potentially hazardous or poorly maintained area. There could be debris or other obstacles present, so the ego car should remain vigilant and prepared for unexpected road conditions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
