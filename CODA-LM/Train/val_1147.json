The truck is white or light-colored on the side. The presence of the truck is significant because its size and closeness may impact the visibility and maneuvering space of the autonomous vehicle, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance to mitigate risks associated with potential abrupt lane changes or stops by the truck.\n\nAdditionally, traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying a red signal above all lanes. This red light is an important cue for the autonomous vehicle, indicating the need to decelerate and prepare to come to a full stop at the intersection in compliance with road safety regulations."

The truck is equipped with visible taillights and multiple wheels, highlighted by lights from the vehicle behind or nearby street lighting. From this perspective, the robust side of the truck shows no signage visible, suggesting it could be either a cargo or freight hauler commonly seen on highways. For the ego car, the presence of this truck is significant. As trucks are typically slower and wider than smaller vehicles, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance to prevent any collisions. Additionally, overtaking such a large vehicle requires careful consideration of the truck's length and the traffic conditions around.",
