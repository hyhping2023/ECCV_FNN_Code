There is a red car parked on the left side beside the road, along with a few other vehicles at varying distances ahead in the same lane. These vehicles are influencing the traffic flow and potential movement options for the ego car.\n\nOn the right side, multiple workers are spotted wearing bright orange safety vests. The mix of sitting and standing workers is close to the roadside, requiring the ego car to drive cautiously due to the risk that the workers may unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\nAlthough traffic signs are not present in the image, there are traffic lights overhead. However, the current state of the lights is not visible, which is critical as it determines whether the ego car can move forward or needs to stop.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are lined up to form a barrier between the active traffic lane and the workers on the side of the road, indicating a construction zone and directing the path that the ego car must follow.\n\nThe construction area is also marked by white temporary fencing or barriers on the right side, which clearly define the zone and prevent the ego car from moving too far to the right.\n\nFinally, there is a line of parked bicycles and scooters on the right side before the roadwork barriers. These parked vehicles potentially reduce the width of the driveable road surface and pose a risk if any were to topple into the traveling lane."
