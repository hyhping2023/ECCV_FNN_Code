        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a large green and white concrete mixer truck on the left side of the autonomous vehicle. The truck is occupying the lane adjacent to the autonomous vehicle's lane and traveling in the same direction. The presence of this truck is significant because its size and the possible limited visibility from the driver's cab mean that the autonomous vehicle must maintain a safe following distance. The vehicle needs to be prepared for any unexpected actions from the truck, like sudden stops or lane changes.\n\nAdditionally, in the distance ahead, there is a traffic light displaying a green signal. This green light signals that the autonomous vehicle can continue moving forward but must remain vigilant. The vehicle has to be ready to respond if the light changes to yellow, indicating the need to prepare to stop.\n\nLastly, there's a green fence on the right side of the road, running parallel to the autonomous vehicle's lane. This barrier separates the road from the sidewalk and serves as a reminder to the vehicle to stay in its lane and avoid crossing into pedestrian paths.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or any other objects that impact the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. Such vehicles are typically equipped with a large rotating drum used to mix and transport concrete in a ready-to-pour state. The presence of this vehicle on the road suggests construction activity nearby or on the route. For the driver of the ego car, it's crucial to maintain a safe following distance, as construction vehicles often make sudden stops and might have debris or concrete spillage. Additionally, these vehicles tend to move slower and make wider turns, influencing the ego car to possibly adjust speed and lane position for safe passage.",
