The truck has its hazard lights flashing. This truck affects the driving behavior of the ego car because its large size may reduce visibility ahead, and the flashing hazard lights indicate it may be moving slower than normal traffic speeds or could stop unexpectedly. \n\nAdditionally, a white van is in front of the construction truck, also in the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The van's presence is crucial as it determines the pace of the construction truck and subsequently, the ego car. The steady distance maintained between the van and the truck suggests a stable traffic flow, but it still requires monitoring."

The hazard lights on the truck indicate a potential hazard that may require the ego car to reduce speed. Overtaking should only be considered if a clear and safe opportunity arises, and after confirming that there's no oncoming traffic. Since the conditions limit visibility and the truck's size restricts sight lines, the ego car should rely on its headlights and possibly high beams (if there's no oncoming traffic) to maximize visibility without causing glare to other drivers."
