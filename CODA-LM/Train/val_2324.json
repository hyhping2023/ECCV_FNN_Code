The car seems to be parked, and it is possible that part of the vehicle is extending into the lane of the ego car. This situation could be hazardous as there is the risk of a side collision if the car starts moving unexpectedly or if more of the vehicle is encroaching onto the roadway than it initially appears. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not contain any items in this image and thus have no impact on the driving conditions for the ego vehicle."

This vehicle appears to be parked or stopped on the side of the roadway. The presence of this vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a cautious approach, specifically ensuring adequate space is left while passing to avoid any collision, especially in a dimly lit environment.",

It should also proceed with caution when passing the partially visible parked car on the right, allowing for a wider berth in case the other vehicle is encroaching more into the travel lane than is visible, or if it begins to move."
