Further ahead in the same lane, there are multiple vehicles that are at various distances from the ego car, also moving in the same direction. The ego car will need to adjust its speed and stopping distance based on the movement and any brake lights observed from these vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist to the left side of the same lane as the ego car, moving in the same direction. Due to the increased vulnerability of motorcyclists, the ego car must exercise additional caution and keep a safe distance to ensure the motorcyclist's safety.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a circular blue traffic sign that indicates a mandatory direction or another road rule that must be followed. Compliance with this sign may affect the ego carâ€™s speed and the choice of lane.\n\nThe image does not contain any traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects."
