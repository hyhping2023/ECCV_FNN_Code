In this context, the barrier is placed near a crosswalk, possibly indicating a closed or restricted section of the roadway or pedestrian path. For the ego car, this barrier necessitates caution and possibly a change in the normal driving path to avoid the restricted area.

Tricycles, especially larger ones, can significantly vary in speed and maneuverability compared to standard vehicles. The presence of a tricycle on the road requires the ego cars driver to be cautious, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for unexpected movements, such as sudden stops or turns by the tricycle. It is also crucial to check for any load the tricycle might be carrying that could potentially destabilize its motion.",

The vehicle's motion plan should be adjusted based on the state of the traffic lights, which will be clearer as the vehicle gets closer."
