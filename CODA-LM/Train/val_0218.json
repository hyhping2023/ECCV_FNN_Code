Firstly, there are two vehicles of interest: a silver SUV parked on the side of the road to the left, which is not a direct obstacle for the ego car, and a white SUV stopped at the pedestrian crossing ahead, which may be waiting for pedestrians or preparing to turn, thus requiring the ego car's attention. Additionally, there are multiple cars in front of the ego car in the same lane, moving in the same direction, which directly influence the speed and movement of the ego car.\n\nA group of pedestrians is observed on the right side, potentially waiting to cross the street at the pedestrian crossing. The presence of these pedestrians means that the ego car must be prepared to stop or yield to them as they could enter the roadway.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a \"No left turn\" sign visible on the left roadside, placed on a mobile sign stand. This sign informs the ego car and other drivers that left turns are prohibited at this junction, which impacts potential turning decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights show a green light ahead for the lane of the ego car, indicating that the ego car has the right of way to proceed forward through the intersection.\n\nLastly, there are temporary white and blue plastic barriers that separate the pedestrian walkway from the road on the right. These barriers indicate a boundary between pedestrian and vehicle areas and channel pedestrian movements at the crossing.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
