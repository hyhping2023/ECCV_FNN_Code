This indicates potential obstructions, nearby workers, or changes in traffic patterns that the ego car should be aware of. \n\nAhead on the right, a green traffic light is visible, indicating that the ego car has the right of way to proceed with caution, considering the road work ahead.\n\nMultiple traffic cones are placed on the road, creating a pathway that channels the traffic to the left, away from the cleaning vehicle and work zone. These cones aim to guide vehicles safely around the work area, changing the normal driving path of the ego car.\n\nA temporary barrier, a white and red striped boom, blocks the pathway to the right of the road, directing the ego car to stay left and be cautious of the narrowed driving space.\n\nLastly, several brown dustbins are lined up on the pavement to the right, behind the road works sign.
