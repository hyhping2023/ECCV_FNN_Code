        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several key elements to observe. A white sedan is traveling ahead in the same lane as the ego car. The sedan's movement and speed are important to monitor because they require the ego car to keep a safe distance, thereby affecting the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nAdditionally, a group of construction workers is present near a construction site on the right side of the road. Their safety is a priority, which necessitates that the ego car exercise increased caution and possibly reduce speed when passing by them.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there's one that shows the speed limit is set at 20 km/h. This sign dictates that the autonomous car must adjust its speed to stay within legal limits. There is also a 'No Parking' sign on the right side of the road, indicating that the area must be kept clear of parked vehicles, hence maintaining a clear passage for driving.\n\nFurthermore, the image includes visual indicators of a construction site, denoted by a series of red plastic barriers. These barriers serve as a delineation between the active roadway and the construction area, ensuring that vehicles stay in their respective lanes and maintain distance from the construction activities.\n\nThe traffic lights, traffic cones, and any other potential objects within the scene have not been mentioned in the provided data, indicating they are either not present or not relevant to the driving scenario."
