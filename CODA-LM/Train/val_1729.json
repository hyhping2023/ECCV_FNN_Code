This vehicle is characterized by its yellow color with reflective markings and a tall arm extended upwards. Although it is positioned on the opposite side of the road, it is significant to the ego car driving behavior. The reason for this caution is the vehicle's potential to be a hazard due to its substantial size and the equipment it carries. Its arm could sway or swing into the lane of the ego car, creating a potential risk. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data, indicating their absence in the image."

It is a large, yellow and brown vehicle featuring a raised platform, which suggests it might be used for tasks such as lifting materials. This type of vehicle usually indicates ongoing construction or repair work nearby. Its presence on the road requires drivers to be cautious and potentially slow down to navigate around it safely, adhering to any temporary traffic signals or guidelines posted near the working area.",
