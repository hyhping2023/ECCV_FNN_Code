This vehicle sets the pace for the ego car and could potentially slow down, stop, or change lanes, thus the ego car should maintain a safe following distance.\n   - A red truck is in the right lane, ahead of the ego vehicle but at a farther distance, also moving in the same direction. This truck may have different acceleration and braking patterns compared to smaller vehicles, which influences the ego car's decision to overtake or keep distance.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - There is a road work warning sign on the overhead gantry to the left side of the highway, indicating construction or maintenance work up ahead. The ego car must be prepared for potential obstructions or lane merging due to road work ahead.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Orange traffic cones are placed in a line towards the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, narrowing the drivable space on the left. The cones indicate that the ego car must stay to the right to avoid the construction zone and merge if necessary."

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone, typically used to signal that there are temporary changes in the driving layout, such as road work or an accident ahead. It's a high-visibility orange color with a reflective band that makes it easily noticeable. Drivers should slow down and prepare for potential lane narrowing or diversion. This helps in maintaining safety and smooth traffic flow. The presence of the traffic cone suggests that the ego car may need to decrease speed and watch for on-site instructions or workers.",

Positioned on the roadway, this traffic cone serves as a temporary traffic control device guiding vehicles away from certain areas of the road to ensure safety. This could indicate road work, an accident or other hazards further ahead. The presence of the cone affects future driving behavior by signaling the driver to slow down, maneuver cautiously, and possibly merge into an adjacent lane.",
