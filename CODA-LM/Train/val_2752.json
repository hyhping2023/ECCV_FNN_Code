On the right side, a cleaning vehicle is parked alongside the curbside, facing away from the ego car, which although currently stationary, could become a hazard if it moves or if personnel step into the road.\n\nMotorcyclists are present in the middle of the road, moving away from the ego vehicle. They require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and speed, as they could slow down, change lanes, or stop unexpectedly.\n\nA blue roundabout sign is visible on the right of the road, indicating a potential roundabout ahead, thus influencing the ego car's navigation decisions. Moreover, a green traffic light is observed on the left side above the road, permitting vehicles to proceed but necessitating monitoring in case it changes to yellow.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are placed in the left lane near the bus, extending back towards the ego car, indicating the closure of the left lane and necessitating a transition to the right lane, impacting the flow of traffic. Additionally, red and white poles connected with a line block entry to the right-hand side pavement area, preventing vehicles from entering and reducing unexpected obstacles or pedestrians entering the road from that area.\n\nWooden barricades are seen on the right side in front of the cleaning vehicle, suggesting a potential construction or maintenance work area, where workers or machinery could move into the road, creating new obstacles or engaging with passing traffic.\n\nOther objects include a series of brown dustbins on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, indicating active cleaning operations nearby and potential personnel or additional vehicles entering the street, though they should not pose an immediate concern."
