It is easily identifiable by its cylindrical mixing drum and attached chutes, signifying its use in concrete transportation. This vehicle's presence necessitates that the ego vehicle either changes lanes or adjusts its speed to safely pass due to the reduction in available lane space.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is seen on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The bright clothing worn by the cyclist improves their visibility. The ego vehicle must maintain an appropriate distance from the cyclist and allow extra room when passing to ensure the cyclist's safety is not jeopardized.\n\nThere's also a traffic light in view, currently green, allowing the ego vehicle to keep moving forward. However, the ego vehicle should remain alert for possible changes in the traffic light and be aware of other users at the intersection who may be responding to different signals.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Since there is a green traffic light ahead, the ego car can continue driving but should remain alert for any changes in the signal as it approaches the intersection."
