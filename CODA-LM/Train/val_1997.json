However, there is a pair of vulnerable road users; two pedestrians are standing close to the kerb by a pedestrian crossing area. One pedestrian is noticeable in a red top and the other in a grey top, both positioned between orange, reflective traffic poles. This proximity to the ego vehicle's driving path implies a need for the vehicle to proceed with caution, as there is a potential risk of the pedestrians stepping onto the road.\n\nThe traffic lights in view show a red signal for the straight-ahead lane, indicating that the ego vehicle is required to stop. Meanwhile, the adjacent lane has a green light, permitting movements to the right, though the action would depend on the intersection's specific traffic rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of orange reflective traffic poles that demarcate the pedestrian zone from the roadway. The poles serve as a guide for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian zone and to avoid encroaching into it.\n\nNo other traffic signs, barriers, or objects are reported in the data, indicating a relatively clear path aside from the noted road users and signals."
