        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are a couple of notable features affecting the driving environment. Firstly, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road, with its rear end protruding slightly onto the sidewalk as it is partially inside a garage space. This parked car's position necessitates a careful maneuver from the ego vehicle, requiring it to slightly shift to the left to safely pass without colliding with the parked car's protruding rear.\n\nAdditionally, near the parked car, garbage containers and bags are positioned on the roadside. The presence of these garbage items adds another layer of complexity to the driving environment. They could potentially conceal other hazards or attract animals, posing an unexpected risk of animals darting into the roadway. This situation warrants extra vigilance and possibly a reduction in speed to allow for sufficient reaction time to any sudden obstacles that might emerge from behind the garbage area. \n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are reported in this observed scene, which allows for a focused consideration on the parked car and garbage as the primary environmental factors influencing driving behavior in this specific situation."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a white car with its rear end visible, including visible taillights. It is parked or positioned in a narrow space between buildings. The presence of this car in such an environment may indicate low traffic flow or that it is parked in a less frequented area. For the ego car, understanding the position and status of this car is crucial as it affects navigational decisions. If the car were to move, it could potentially enter the roadway, necessitating a reaction from the ego car such as slowing down or changing lanes to maintain safe driving conditions.",
