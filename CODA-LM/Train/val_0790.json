It is only partially visible with its front end facing towards the direction of the ego vehicle. This vehicle is critical to monitor despite its partial visibility because it may either join the traffic soon or become an obstacle.\n\nThe second category, 'barriers,' features large cable reels and construction materials situated on the sidewalk to the left. The presence of these barriers likely indicates an ongoing construction or work area nearby. Due to these barriers, there is a potential for traffic obstruction or diversion, requiring drivers to exercise caution and stay alert to any temporary changes in traffic patterns.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects, are absent in this traffic image, indicating no presence of such elements."

It is blue and white, made from a durable material such as wood or plastic, and is positioned upright, suggesting it might still be in use or simply stored outside. In a driving scenario, this object serves little relevance to the behavior of the driver unless it becomes a road hazard by inadvertently moving onto the roadway. Currently, it poses no direct threat or need for action from the driver of the ego car.",

The placement of such objects on the roadside should not directly impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, as long as the objects remain well within the boundaries of the storage area. However, the ego vehicle should maintain a careful watch on the roadside for any unexpected movements or obstacles that might emerge near such storage areas.",
