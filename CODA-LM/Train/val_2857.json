This indicates a possible construction or roadwork activity that can affect the flow of traffic or may temporarily obstruct part of the roadway. The construction worker, who is wearing a high-visibility safety vest and is positioned adjacent to the forklift, represents a vulnerable road user. Their presence necessitates increased vigilance from the driver of the ego vehicle to safely navigate around them.\n\nAdditionally, in the distance, traffic lights can be seen with one set displaying green lights. This symbolizes that the ego vehicle has the right to proceed. However, despite the green signal, the driver must remain cautious due to the nearby construction activity.\n\nMoreover, there are green and blue temporary barriers or fencing installed on the side of the road. These barriers are indicative of a construction or work zone and might diminish the width of the usable lane or present new obstacles on the road that the driver needs to pay attention to.\n\nThere is no mention of any traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects in the traffic image, suggesting that none are present or relevant to the driving conditions."
