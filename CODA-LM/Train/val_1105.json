The truck's brake lights are visible, indicating that it is either moving slowly or has come to a stop. Due to the size of the truck and the activated brake lights, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to be prepared for any potential sudden stops.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bus on the right side, adjacent to the ego car. The bus is partially visible and appears to be in motion, which is inferred from the lighting and reflections on its surface. The presence and movement of the bus could affect the ego car's ability to safely merge or change lanes to the right.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
