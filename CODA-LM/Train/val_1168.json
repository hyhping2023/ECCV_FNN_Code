This vehicle's presence demands that other drivers either slow down or switch lanes to avoid an accident, as it has a significant impact on the normal flow of traffic. Additionally, a line of traffic cones has been arranged to signal an area of construction or a detour route. The cones serve to guide vehicles through a narrowed passage, hence drivers should proceed with caution and at a slower speed."
