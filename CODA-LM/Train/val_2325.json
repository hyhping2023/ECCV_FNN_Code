On the right side of the road, there is a white car parked facing away from the ego car's direction of travel. This parked vehicle may reduce the available road width and possibly hide other road users, such as pedestrians, who might step into the road unexpectedly. Following this white car, there are multiple vehicles lined up and parked on the same side. These vehicles create a narrow driving path for the ego car, demanding careful navigation and vigilance for any doors opening or pedestrians that could emerge between the cars.\n\nAdditionally, there is a motorcyclist wearing a red coat directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car, moving in the same direction. The presence of the motorcyclist requires the ego car to keep a safe distance and be prepared to adjust its speed, as the motorcyclist may slow down, turn suddenly, or execute an unexpected maneuver.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

It should also navigate through the narrowed road space with caution due to the parked cars on the right side, being prepared to stop or slow down if a pedestrian appears from between the parked vehicles or if a door opens. No sudden maneuvers should be made, and the speed should be adjusted according to the road conditions and visibility. Furthermore, maintain a lookout for additional road users that may not be initially visible due to the parked vehicles."
