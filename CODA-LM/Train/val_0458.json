The brake lights are illuminated, indicating it is stationary. This presence of the vehicle influences the ego car to maintain a safe stopping distance and prepare for movement once the traffic light changes. Additionally, on the right side, there is another car positioned in an adjacent lane, also stopped at the intersection. This vehicle indicates the presence of multiple lanes and the potential for lane-changing maneuvers after the intersection is crossed.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, a cyclist is on the right side of the road, just ahead of the stationary vehicles, visible by the reflective material and the bicycle's lights. The cyclist may affect the ego car's decision to change lanes or turn right, requiring the ego car to yield and watch for the cyclist's movement. Furthermore, pedestrians are visible in the distance on the sidewalk to the right, separate from the vehicles. Although they are currently not crossing the street, the ego car should monitor them in case they enter a crosswalk or crossing area.\n\nIn terms of traffic lights, a green traffic light is visible straight ahead, indicating it is permissible to proceed through the intersection when safe. The green light informs the ego car that it can continue driving forward once the vehicle in front starts moving."

Bollards are short vertical posts typically used to control or direct road traffic, such as creating barriers between vehicle lanes and pedestrian areas. In this scenario, it serves to prevent vehicles from incorrectly entering designated areas that are not meant for vehicular traffic. For the ego car, this bollard influences future driving behavior by delineating the driving path and ensuring that the vehicle remains within the correct traffic lanes. It is crucial for the driver to notice and avoid these to prevent vehicular damage and maintain safe traffic flow.",

Additionally, periodically check for pedestrians potentially entering a crossing zone. Do not attempt to change lanes or make turns without ensuring the path is clear of the aforementioned road users."
