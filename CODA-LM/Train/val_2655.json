There's also a blue truck on the left side of the road that is either parked or moving slowly; although it isn't an immediate threat, it might hide pedestrians or other vehicles. Additionally, several cars are visible in the distance, moving forward, impacting the flow of traffic the ego car is in.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, there are two pedestrians on the right side near the white car, which might enter the street, so the ego car needs to stay vigilant. A pedestrian crossing sign is ahead, indicating an area where pedestrians may cross, requiring heightened awareness. A cyclist further ahead is moving towards the right, which means the cyclist could cross the ego car's path, and should be closely watched.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there's a pedestrian crossing sign on the right, signaling the possibility of pedestrians in the road and necessitating caution. There is also a speed limit sign that sets the speed limit at 20 km/h, and the ego car must adjust its speed to comply.\n\nOther objects in the road include a large garbage bin ahead filled with trash. The bin is blocking the lane and must be circumvented by the ego car, possibly by changing lanes or maneuvering around it.\n\nThe data indicates no presence of traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the current traffic image."
