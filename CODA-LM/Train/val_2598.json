The presence of the red traffic light requires the ego car to stop and wait until the light turns green before it can proceed.\n\nFurthermore, there are two orange and white traffic cones placed on the right edge of the driving lane. These traffic cones suggest that there may be road work ahead or an area that the ego car should avoid. As a result, the ego car should proceed with caution in response to these indicators."
