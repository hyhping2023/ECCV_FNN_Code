It is heavily loaded and could either be moving slowly or be stationary, posing a challenge for traffic flow. This situation necessitates that the ego car either changes lanes or reduces speed to maintain safety. Additionally, two traffic lights are in view, both displaying red signals, which means the ego car is required to halt at the intersection until the lights change to green. On the right edge of the intersection, a distinct traffic cone with red and white stripes is noticeable. This cone likely signifies the presence of road work or an obstacle, which calls for drivers to proceed with caution and be aware of potential lane restrictions. Moreover, the scene includes several bright streetlights that are causing reflections, which could diminish visibility. Such conditions demand heightened attentiveness from drivers to recognize other road users and navigate the area safely. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or barriers have been reported in this scene."
