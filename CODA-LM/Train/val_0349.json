Ahead, green traffic lights above the intersection apply to the lanes going straight, indicating that the ego car and the other vehicles in its lane have the right of way to proceed.\n\nLastly, orange and white traffic barriers on the left separate the lanes of oncoming traffic from those moving in the same direction, enhancing separation and lane discipline for safety."
