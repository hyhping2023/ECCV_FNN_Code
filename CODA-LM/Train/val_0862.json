        "description and explanation": "The traffic image shows several elements that are critical for autonomous driving systems to consider. There is a blue sedan positioned in the same lane ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The presence of this sedan is significant as it determines the following distance the ego car must maintain, allowing enough space to react to any sudden stops or speed changes that the sedan might make.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a stationary construction vehicle facing the direction of the ego car. This vehicle has some equipment extending slightly into the lane, indicating that the ego car must be prepared to adjust its lateral position slightly to maintain a safe passing distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a covered car parked on the right side of the road. While it does not obstruct the ego car's lane, it still requires attention. It is important for the ego car to remain alert for any unpredictable movements that might happen in the vicinity of the parked car.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are pedestrians on the right who appear to be at a safe distance from the ego car's current trajectory. Nevertheless, the autonomous system in the ego car must continuously monitor the pedestriansâ€™ movements to ensure they don't unexpectedly step onto the roadway.\n\nFinally, there are directional traffic signs placed overhead that provide information about lane designations and potential directions. Although these signs primarily serve navigational purposes, they must be observed by the ego car's driving system, especially if a lane change is needed according to the car's intended route.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image, thus requiring no immediate consideration from the ego car's autonomous driving system."

Buses are often used for public transportation and can influence driving behavior significantly. The presence of a bus on the road generally requires drivers to exercise caution, particularly when the bus is stopping to pick up or drop off passengers. Drivers behind the bus may need to slow down or stop and wait until passengers have boarded or alighted and the bus resumes motion.
