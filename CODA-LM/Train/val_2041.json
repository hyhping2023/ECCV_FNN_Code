This suggests that the ego car may need to slow down or change lanes. Additionally, a blue truck is visible in the left lane beside the bus, partially obstructed from view, which is significant for lane-changing decisions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a speed limit sign indicating a speed limit of 20, accompanied by orange warning signs. This informs drivers to reduce their speed likely due to road conditions or work zones ahead, and the warning signs signal a change in normal traffic patterns or potential hazards.\n\nIn front of these signs, traffic cones are placed in an arrow formation pointing left, directing traffic out of the right lane. This aligns with the warning signs and indicates construction or road work ahead. Furthermore, a barrier with reflective signs is positioned on the road along with the traffic cones, guiding traffic out of the right lane and acting as a physical obstruction to prevent vehicles from entering a potentially hazardous or restricted area."
