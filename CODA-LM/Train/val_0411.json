First, vehicles in the vicinity include a white car directly ahead of the ego car with its brake lights on, indicating it may be slowing down or has stopped. The ego car must adjust its speed and maintain an appropriate following distance in response to this car's behavior. Additionally, there is a light-colored car on the right side ahead that seems to be parked or moving slowly. The ego car needs to be cautious in case this vehicle merges into the flow of traffic or if a door is opened.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, a pedestrian is crossing the street from the left to the right in front of the ego car, necessitating that the ego car yield and possibly change its driving path. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right; one is close to the edge and may be considering crossing the street, which requires the ego car to closely monitor their movements.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a directional sign overhead in the distance with unclear lane instructions, which could affect the ego car's lane choice and intended route depending on the sign's details. There is also a traffic light directly ahead displaying red, compelling the ego car to stop and wait for it to turn green before continuing.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this traffic image to report on."
