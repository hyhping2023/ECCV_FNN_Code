This sedan is traversing the cross-path and may pose a hazard if it unexpectedly turns or stops. Additionally, a blue bus is positioned in the left-hand turn lane of the direction opposite the ego car, indicating a potential left turn across the ego car's path. The bus may initiate a turn which would require the ego car to yield or stop to avoid a collision.\n\nA no entry sign is seen on the right side, above the bus, along with a directional sign permitting left turns and straight movements. This sign indicates restrictions on the road ahead, suggesting that the ego car should not plan to enter this lane. Directly above the roadway, a green traffic light is visible, signifying the allowance to proceed. The green light means the ego car has the right-of-way to continue forward or make movements in accordance with traffic regulations.\n\nOn the right side of the road, red and white traffic cones line the side, delineating a restricted work area or a lane closed off from traffic. These cones direct traffic flow and indicate a reduced roadway width, requiring the attention of the ego car for safe passage. \n\nAdditionally, pedestrian crossing signs are visible on the right, and a group of schoolchildren and adults are standing there, suggesting potential pedestrian crossing activity. The proximity of the pedestrian crossing and the presence of pedestrians necessitate a cautious approach with attention to possible people crossing."

On streets and pathways, bollards are used to control or direct road traffic, preventing vehicles from entering specific areas. For the driving scenario, this bollard serves as a visual guide indicating areas that are off-limits to vehicles, thus enhancing pedestrian safety and organizing traffic flow. The ego car must respect these boundaries to avoid collisions and ensure safe passage for pedestrians.",

The primary function of a bus in traffic is transporting multiple passengers along designated routes. Buses are larger and occupy more space on the road compared to standard cars. The presence of a bus ahead requires the ego car to possibly adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain safe following distance and anticipate stops that the bus may make at designated bus stops. Understanding and reacting appropriately to the bus's movements and stops is crucial for safe driving and avoiding rear-end collisions.",

The green light allows for safe continuation through the intersection but it is critical to monitor the aforementioned road users and adjust speed and positioning accordingly."
