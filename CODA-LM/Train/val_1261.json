This vehicle would prevent the ego vehicle from moving forward in the current lane due to its size and stationary position. Additionally, there is an orange traffic cone visible on the ground to the right of the construction vehicle, adjacent to the blue barrier. It marks the construction zone and indicates that the ego vehicle might need to change lanes or slow down in this area. Furthermore, blue construction barriers are present on both sides of the construction vehicle, extending along the right side of the road. These barriers define a construction zone and indicate restricted access or possible obstructions on the right side of the road, necessitating caution or a lane change by the ego vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image."

This type of vehicle typically operates at lower speeds and its presence in the roadway implies nearby construction activity. The driving behavior of the ego car should adjust accordingly, ensuring reduced speed and heightened alertness to accommodate potential unexpected movements or obstructions caused by the construction vehicle or related site activities.",
