Additionally, there is a yellow car ahead on the right side, partially on the roadway.

Pedestrians close to the roadway may enter the street unexpectedly, therefore the ego vehicle must monitor their movements and be prepared to stop.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a green directional sign on the right, mounted higher on a pole.
