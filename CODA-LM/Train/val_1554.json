Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a white sedan visible from the rear right side, indicating that the ego vehicle is following it. This requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance, as the actions of the white sedan, such as braking or turning, will directly influence its driving decisions. \n\nOn the right side of the road, a yellow excavator is positioned on a platform above the surface and is surrounded by traffic cones. Although not in the direct path of the ego vehicle, this indicates ongoing construction work, which could involve construction workers or unexpected movements affecting road safety.\n\nAhead in a parallel lane to the left, a green bus is traveling. The size of the bus and its potential to stop or maneuver to pick up and drop off passengers may affect traffic flow, requiring the ego vehicle to adapt its speed or possibly change lanes.\n\nTraffic cones are placed along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, leading up to the construction site. These serve as a warning to reduce speed and possibly indicate a lane narrowing or shift due to the construction activity.\n\nFinally, the traffic lights above the intersection are not visible in the image. Normally, the state of these lights would dictate the right of way at an intersection, but since they cannot be seen, it is important to remain vigilant for other indicators of the required driving behavior."
