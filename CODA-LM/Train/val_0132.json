The proximity and trajectory of this minivan suggest that it could potentially change lanes or slow down, necessitating that the ego car maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if needed.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are signs indicating a straight direction and another forbidding a right turn. These signs inform the ego vehicle about the allowed traffic movements at the upcoming intersection, specifically that the ego car cannot turn right.\n\nAhead, traffic lights are visible with a red signal illuminated over all lanes. This red light indicates that the ego vehicle must stop at the intersection and wait for the light to change before proceeding.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed along the edge of the rightmost lane, signaling a potential hazard or construction zone. These cones guide vehicles to stay left and avoid the coned-off area.\n\nAdditionally, white and red plastic barriers are positioned on the left side of the pedestrian crossing area. These barriers serve to protect the pedestrian area and indicate that vehicles should not cross into this area, thereby preserving a clear path for pedestrians."
