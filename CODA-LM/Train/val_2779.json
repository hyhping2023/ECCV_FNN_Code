Additionally, there is a green truck ahead on the right side, which appears to be in motion. The truck's movements could potentially impact the ego car's path as it may be entering or exiting the construction area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the image.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a road work sign on the right, indicating that there is construction ahead. This sign is important as it alerts the ego car to potential obstructions or altered traffic patterns that may be encountered.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a green light ahead, which indicates that the ego car has the right of way to proceed through the intersection.\n\nOrange traffic cones are present on the right side of the road, delineating a construction area. These cones are significant as they indicate that part of the road is closed for construction, which may narrow the drivable roadway, requiring the ego car to navigate carefully.\n\nLastly, there is a yellow and black striped barrier on the right, partially obstructing a lane. This barrier indicates roadworks, and it suggests that the ego car may need to merge left to continue safely without encountering the obstruction.\n\nThere are no other objects in the image that affect the driving conditions."
