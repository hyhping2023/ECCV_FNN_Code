They are wearing high-visibility clothing and are actively engaged in construction work. Their proximity to the road means the ego car must reduce speed and exercise increased caution to avoid any potential accidents should a worker enter the roadway.\n\nSurrounding the maintenance area on the median strip, traffic cones and warning signs are set up, signaling ongoing work. This setup warns the ego car of a possible hazard zone, indicating that the lane might be partially blocked or that workers could be near the driving lane. The ego car should be prepared to respond to any sudden changes in the road conditions.\n\nAdditionally, a temporary barrier is installed on the right side of the road, separating the work zone from the lanes open to traffic. This barrier serves to direct the traffic flow, indicating that the ego car should stay to the left and be mindful of the work zone to avoid any obstacles or interference with the workers."
