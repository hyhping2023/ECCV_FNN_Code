This green light signals that the ego car is clear to proceed through the intersection or continue straight, subject to its planned route.\n\nAdditionally, there is a temporary construction barrier situated on the right side of the road, running parallel to the ego car's lane. The barrier signifies ongoing construction or a restricted area, indicating that the ego car must remain within the marked driving lanes and be alert for any sudden alterations in the traffic pattern due to the construction.\n\nThe JSON data does not list any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects in the traffic image; therefore, these categories are not considered in the summary."

It is used for lifting and moving materials over short distances in construction sites and other industrial environments. The presence of a construction vehicle on or near the roadway indicates ongoing construction activity, which may impact driving behavior. Drivers should exercise caution, reduce speed, and be prepared for unexpected stops or detours due to the construction work.
