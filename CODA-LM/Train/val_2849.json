This vehicle may affect the driving behavior as it could start moving or be engaged in loading or unloading activities, which can impact the available space for the ego car to maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is observed crossing the street in front of the ego car, moving from right to left. This pedestrian's presence could potentially cause the ego car to slow down or come to a stop to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of various storefronts on the right side of the road suggests that there might be pedestrians unexpectedly stepping onto the street. This scenario necessitates that the ego car remains alert and prepared for any sudden pedestrian movements that could affect its driving path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
