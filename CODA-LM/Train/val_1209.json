It is situated off the roadside, likely within a storage or utility area associated with nearby industrial activities. Such objects are not part of the active roadway environment and thus do not directly influence the immediate driving decisions of the ego car. However, the presence of industrial equipment near the road may suggest that heavy vehicles or increased traffic could occasionally enter the roadway in this area.
