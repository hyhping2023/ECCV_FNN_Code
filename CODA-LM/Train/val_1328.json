            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement components. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road typically indicates nearby construction activity. For the driving behavior of the ego car, the driver should be cautious and aware of potential stops or slow movement from this truck, as these vehicles often decelerate to navigate site entrances or prepare for cement pouring operations. Additionally, the width and operational nature of the truck may require other vehicles, including the ego car, to maintain a safe following distance and possibly change lanes to safely overtake if the truck is moving slower than the flow of traffic.",

Monitor the white truck and black sedan for any lane changes or braking that may affect the ego car's path. Continue to observe for any new road users or changes in road conditions, and be prepared to adjust speed or lane position accordingly. Do not attempt to overtake or change lanes to the left due to the barriers."
