Firstly, there is a large truck with a red cabin and gray trailer occupying the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. This truck's size and position influence potential lane changes and overtaking maneuvers for the ego car. Secondly, a red bus is ahead in the far left lane, appearing to be in motion and driving in the same direction as the ego car. The bus may stop to pick up or drop off passengers, necessitating the ego car to anticipate slowing traffic or stopping vehicles ahead. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in this image."

Visible is the side and rear sections showing multiple axles and wheels, and it appears to be a cargo truck. The truck, due to its size and nature of the cargo, is likely to influence the driving behavior of the ego car by limiting the space on the road, possibly requiring the ego car to slow down or maintain a safer distance to allow for adequate stopping time and to avoid any potential debris or obstacles that might dislodge from the truck's load.",

Be prepared to reduce speed if the red bus on the left makes any stops, and be cautious of other vehicles potentially changing lanes to overtake the bus. Avoid sudden maneuvers and keep an eye on the rear-view mirror for any vehicles that may be approaching from behind."
