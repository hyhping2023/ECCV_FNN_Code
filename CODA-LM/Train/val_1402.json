The truck's rear side is facing the ego car, and its rear lights are illuminated, suggesting that it is either moving or about to move. Due to the truck's size and potential speed, it is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for any sudden stops or turns that the truck may execute.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible above the road in front of the ego car, which is displaying a red signal. This red light requires all vehicles, including the ego car, to come to a complete stop at the intersection. The ego car must wait for the light to turn green before it can safely proceed through the intersection."

The truck is in a motion blur, suggesting it is moving, possibly across the intersection. The presence of a large vehicle like a truck in an intersection requires the ego car to remain cautious and possibly halt or slow down to allow the truck to pass through safely.

Observing the truck's signals and brake lights will give additional cues about its intent to move or turn."
