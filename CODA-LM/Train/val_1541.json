The presence of this vehicle necessitates the maintenance of a safe following distance by the autonomous car and preparedness for any sudden movements or stops the truck may make. Additionally, there is a traffic light visible above the concrete mixer truck that seems to be red. If this light is indeed red for the direction that the ego vehicle is traveling, then this calls for the vehicle to come to a stop. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

These types of vehicles are typically larger and slower moving compared to regular traffic. For the ego car, the presence of this vehicle influences driving behavior by necessitating an increase in caution and potentially requiring the driver to slow down or change lanes to safely navigate around the vehicle, especially if it is performing operations or parked on the roadway.",
