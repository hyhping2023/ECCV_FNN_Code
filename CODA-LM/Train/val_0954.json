Firstly, there is a silver SUV parked on the left side of the road near the curb. The presence of the parked SUV necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe distance while driving past to avoid any potential collisions. Further down the road on the same side, there is a blue car also parked. This parked blue car similarly requires the ego car to keep a safe distance as it passes by.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users present. A cyclist is observed crossing the road from the right to the left, which means the ego car must slow down and yield to avoid a collision with the cyclist. Another cyclist is riding along the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car needs to maintain a safe lateral distance from this cyclist and be cautious of any sudden movements that might occur.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
