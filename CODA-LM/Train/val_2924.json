The presence of this type of vehicle on the road generally indicates nearby construction work. For the ego car, this means increased vigilance is required due to the potential for sudden stops or reduced speeds of the construction vehicle.

If the construction vehicle comes to a stop, the ego car should be prepared to stop as well and wait for directions from a traffic marshal or for the vehicle to resume movement."
