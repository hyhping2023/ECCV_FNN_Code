Firstly, there are parked cars on the right side of the road, which are comprised of various sedans and possibly a hatchback situated within the parking lane. The presence of these parked vehicles narrows the available width of the lane that can be utilized by the ego car. Additionally, they could obscure the line of sight for other road users, hindering visibility of events that may unfold on the sidewalk or between the parked cars. Secondly, a metal barrier is positioned alongside the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the driving lane and the pedestrian area. This barrier serves a crucial role in guiding the driving path and ensuring that access to the pedestrian zone is restricted, effectively preventing any inadvertent encroachment onto the sidewalk area by vehicles."

The placement of this car influences the ego vehicle's driving behavior by necessitating a cautious approach, especially if the ego vehicle intends to use a part of the road near the parked car. This requires vigilance to avoid any sudden movements from the parked car, such as doors opening or the vehicle pulling out into the road.",
