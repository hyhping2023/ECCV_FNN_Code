Due consideration is required for the spatial margins. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in front occupying the same lane as the ego car, all moving in the same direction. The flow and behavior of these vehicles ahead will affect the ego car's speed and following distance.\n\nOn the roadside, there's a pedestrian on the right sidewalk, parallel to the ego vehicle. The proximity of the pedestrian necessitates that the ego car stay alert to stop or decelerate rapidly if the pedestrian steps onto the road.\n\nNotable traffic infrastructure includes a blue overhead directional sign in the distance on the right, providing important routing information that might necessitate a lane change.\n\nLastly, red and white traffic poles are present on the edge of the right side of the road, marking the boundary of a construction area. They indicate that the ego car should be cautious of potential changes in traffic flow or unexpected obstacles due to the nearby construction. Traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this scene."

In this driving scenario, the presence of a bollard influences the driving behavior by indicating that the driver should maintain a safe distance from the curb, ensuring the vehicle does not veer off the drivable roadway or encroach upon safety zones demarcated for pedestrians or protected areas.",
