Barriers of this type are usually made of highly visible materials with reflective features for night visibility. Given its placement, it significantly influences the ego car's navigation by limiting access to parts of the road and possibly indicating a narrowed driving path. The driver of the ego car should prepare to adhere to this change in driving environment by adjusting lane position and maintaining vigilant spatial awareness.",

Be prepared to stop or yield at the upcoming intersection as the traffic light status is uncertain. Shift slightly to the left, away from the road works, while staying in the correct lane, and be cautious of any workers or unexpected obstacles. Due to the wet or potentially icy road conditions, increase the distance to the vehicle ahead and avoid any sudden maneuvers."
