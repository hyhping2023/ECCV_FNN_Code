On the right side of the road, there is a collection of construction vehicles and trucks parked in various orientations. This suggests potential construction activity, which may involve workers on the road and the possibility of unexpected vehicle movements, requiring the ego vehicle to be cautious and prepared for sudden stops or detours.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist ahead of the ego vehicle, riding along the right edge of the rightmost lane. The presence of the cyclist, who is more vulnerable than motorized vehicles, means the ego vehicle must either slow down or change lanes to overtake the cyclist safely, ensuring they are given enough space.\n\nFurthermore, the same cyclist, described as wearing dark clothing and riding in the same direction as the ego car, emphasizes the need for the ego vehicle to be vigilant and either reduce speed or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance from the cyclist.\n\nLastly, Jersey barriers are installed down the centerline of the road, creating a physical division between the lanes of oncoming traffic. This could indicate lane shifts or ongoing roadwork. The ego vehicle must stay alert for any abrupt end to the lane divider or for signs directing a merge.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
