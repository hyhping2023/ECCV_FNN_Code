Additionally, there are traffic cones with yellow and black stripes in the middle of the road indicating roadwork or an obstruction, so the driver would need to slow down and might require changing lanes. Furthermore, there is a barrier with reflective material placed directly on the driving path, signaling a closed lane or an area that the vehicle must navigate around.

Traffic lights are critical control devices at intersections or road junctions used to manage traffic flow by providing signals to drivers. The green color indicates it is safe for vehicles in the corresponding lanes to proceed, which directly impacts the decision-making of the driver of the ego car to continue driving forward without interruption or hesitation. This operational aspect of the traffic light ensures efficient and safe vehicular movement through controlled intersections.",
