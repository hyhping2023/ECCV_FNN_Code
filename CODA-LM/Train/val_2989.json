While this vehicle is not an immediate threat, the ego car should keep a safe distance and stay alert in case the sedan decides to merge back into traffic. Additionally, there is a utility van stopped on the road with an orange traffic cone placed behind it. This setup suggests that there may be roadwork or an obstruction ahead. Consequently, the ego car needs to be ready to slow down, potentially change lanes, and proceed with caution. The presence of the traffic cone reinforces the need for vigilance as it signals a hazard or work zone, prompting the ego car to be prepared for unexpected changes in the traffic flow or road conditions. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data that require attention."
