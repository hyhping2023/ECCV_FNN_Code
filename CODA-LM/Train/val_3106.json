It is important to monitor this bicycle as it is stationary at the moment, but there is a possibility of it being moved or used by a rider, which could unexpectedly alter the road conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian walking to the left of the ego car's trajectory, located just beyond a row of dustbins. The pedestrian's movement close to the roadway could impact the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle, especially if the pedestrian were to enter the road.\n\nLastly, multiple dustbins are lined up along the left side of the road, slightly jutting into the potential path of the ego vehicle. Although these dustbins are static, it is essential to remain vigilant for any individuals or animals that might surface from between the bins, as they could pose a risk to safe navigation."
