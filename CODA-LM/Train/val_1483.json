The truck's size and position suggest it is either moving slowly or is stationary, potentially obstructing the path of the ego vehicle or causing traffic flow to be slower.

Monitoring the truck's brake lights for any indication of motion is also important. Once the traffic light turns green, the ego car should proceed with caution, especially if the truck in front moves off slowly due to its heavy load."
