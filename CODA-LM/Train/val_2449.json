This traffic light requires vehicles to stop, which means that if the ego car is currently in motion, it should prepare to come to a halt.\n\nFurthermore, a series of traffic cones are placed in the middle of the road, acting as a lane divider. These cones indicate a change in traffic lanes, and the ego car must navigate around them to maintain the correct lane, which will alter its path accordingly.\n\nLastly, there are white reflective barriers positioned to the left, which narrow the drivable pathway. These barriers limit the available road space, and the ego car will need to adjust its lateral position to avoid a collision and safely pass through the narrowed area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects reported in the image."
