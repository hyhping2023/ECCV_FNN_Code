However, there is a traffic light that is either off or not clearly visible due to low light conditions. This situation necessitates that the driver approaches the intersection as if it were an all-way stop, proceeding with caution due to the lack of traffic light guidance. Additionally, there are two vertical striped poles present, which typically signify roadworks or a similar obstacle. These markers are important as they indicate potential changes in the normal traffic pattern or the presence of hazards ahead, requiring the driver to be alert and prepared for unexpected conditions."

It is important to be vigilant for other road users who may be difficult to see in these conditions."
