        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers. However, there are other objects present, specifically large spools of cable off to the side of the road. Some spools are upright, while one is lying down, indicating they may be unused or stored. Though these objects aren't on the road, their proximity suggests potential ongoing or upcoming work near the roadway. The autonomous driving system should recognize this to anticipate possible future disruptions or obstacles that could affect navigation."

The presence of this object near the road indicates that the area might be a storage or utility zone, potentially leading to occasional traffic from vehicles loading or unloading equipment. The ego car should maintain awareness for unexpected movements of vehicles or personnel around such zones, which may influence driving speed or lane choice to ensure safety.",

The reel is made of sturdy materials and features a radial structure with spokes, which helps in winding or unwinding the cable efficiently. In the driving scenario, although the reel is placed off the roadway and within a secured boundary, its presence near the roadside can serve as a visual alert for drivers to maintain a safe distance from the roadside obstacles, thereby promoting caution while driving.",
