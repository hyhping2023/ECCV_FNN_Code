The presence of these vehicles narrows the drivable area and could conceal other potential hazards, necessitating cautious driving by the ego car. Additionally, in the distance, traffic lights showing a green signal are evident. The ego car is free to continue its motion under the current green light, but the situation requires attention since the light may change. Moreover, white barriers have been placed on both sides of the street, which serve to define the driving lane and restrict the available space for the ego car to make maneuvers. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that affect the ego car's driving behavior."

Placed here on the roadway, it alerts the driver of the ego car to steer clear of potential hazards nearby, perhaps due to ongoing road work or an accident scene ahead. As such, the driver should reduce speed and prepare to change lanes if necessary to avoid the marked area.",

Traffic cones are designed to be highly visible and are often used to indicate areas where vehicles should not pass, such as road construction zones or accident scenes. In this scenario, the presence of a traffic cone suggests there might be hazards or changes in the normal traffic pattern ahead. Consequently, the ego car should prepare to slow down, pay extra attention to potential signals or instructions, and possibly alter its course to avoid the indicated hazard.",

No overtaking should be attempted due to space constraints and visibility concerns around the parked vehicles. Maintain a vigilant watch for any emerging hazards."
