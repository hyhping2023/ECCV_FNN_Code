        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario observed, there are several key elements and road users identified that directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there's a large truck positioned directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane. This truck is notably carrying a cylindrical cargo container, is brightly lit with tail lights, and is adorned with reflective signs, making it easily noticeable. The presence of this truck necessitates the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance and remain vigilant, ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if the truck slows down or comes to an unexpected stop. \n\nAdditionally, two traffic signs are visible that significantly impact driving decisions. On the right side of the road, there's a 'No Parking' sign, explicitly indicating that stopping or parking along this segment of the curb is prohibited. Furthermore, there is a 'No Left Turn' sign affixed to the traffic light post, also on the right. This sign clearly communicates that left turns are not permitted at the upcoming intersection, influencing the ego car's route planning and available maneuvers for changing direction.\n\nLastly, the traffic light situation is a critical component to consider. There is a traffic light displaying a red signal located right above the 'No Left Turn' sign. The red light mandates that the ego car must come to a complete halt and wait for the light to shift to green before proceeding further. \n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are mentioned, implying that they are not present or not relevant in this particular scenario."

The bus is currently positioned on the road ahead, partially visible on its front left. Considering this object, the ego car must be cautious and maintain a safe following distance.

Until the traffic light turns green, no further action should be recommended."
