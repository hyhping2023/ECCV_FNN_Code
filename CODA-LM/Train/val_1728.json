These vehicles have reflective lights that indicate their presence and are positioned parallel to the road while remaining stationary. The parked cars lead to a reduced road width available for the ego car to navigate, potentially hiding pedestrians or other hazards from view. Furthermore, there's a risk associated with these parked vehicles, such as the sudden opening of car doors or a car pulling out into the traffic unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible on the right side of the road, located at an upcoming intersection or pedestrian crossing. It is currently displaying a green light, signifying that the ego car has the right of way to proceed, given that it is safe to do so and that there are no other road users present that might affect this right. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the scene that need to be addressed."
