This vehicle is not currently influencing the road as it is contained within the car wash facility. However, attention is needed in case it exits and enters the roadway.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - A large red and yellow sign indicating a service, possibly a promotional offer associated with the car wash facility. Although it does not directly affect traffic, such signs may attract attention, causing potential customers to slow down or stop to enter the facility, thereby affecting traffic flow.\n  - Another sign appears to be a price board for fuel, suggesting the proximity of a gas station. The presence of a gas station means vehicles may slow down, stop, or turn to enter, affecting the ego car's navigation and necessitating caution.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Several orange and white traffic cones are placed in a line on the right side of the image, in front of the signs. These cones likely demarcate the boundaries of the car wash and gas station, indicating areas where the ego car should not drive.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Yellow and black protective bollards are positioned in front of the car wash station. These bollards serve to protect the car wash structure from accidental vehicle collisions and must be avoided when driving.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects were present in the image."
