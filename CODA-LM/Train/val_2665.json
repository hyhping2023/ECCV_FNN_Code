        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are several notable road features and users. A white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, and it does not have its lights on, indicating that the vehicle is stationary. This parked car is occupying part of the right lane, which may block the ego car's route, necessitating a lane change for safe passage.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic light in view is green, signifying that the ego car has the right to continue traveling without the need to halt. This provides a clear indication for the ego car to maintain its movement along the road.\n\nAdditionally, two yellow traffic cones are spotted on the left edge of the right lane. These cones likely indicate the presence of a potential road hazard or ongoing roadwork, hinting at a possible narrowing of the driving path. It is advisable for drivers to approach this area with heightened caution to ensure safety.\n\nOverall, the scenario includes a parked vehicle that may require a lane change, a green traffic light allowing for continuous movement, and traffic cones signaling caution due to possible roadwork or hazards."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a bollard, typically a short vertical post used in traffic management. Bollards are employed fundamentally to control or direct road traffic, such as preventing access to certain areas by vehicles or to ensure pedestrian safety by creating barriers between vehicle paths and walkways. Additionally, they can act as a protective barrier guarding pedestrians and properties against vehicular impacts. In this scenario, the presence of a bollard suggests some limitations on the maneuverability of the ego car, particularly in terms of any vehicular movement towards the sides where the bollard is positioned.",

Traffic cones are generally employed to divert vehicles, indicate areas under construction or repair, or warn of hazards on the road ahead. These cones guide vehicles by delineating traffic boundaries or redirecting traffic flows, and their presence in this setting suggests a similar needfrom guiding the ego car away from nearby roadwork or obstacles to possible redirection due to an ongoing temporary road condition. The ego car should anticipate possible alterations in route or reduced speed areas.",
