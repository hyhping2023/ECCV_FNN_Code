While these parked vehicles present a static hazard by reducing the road width and potentially obscuring pedestrians, they are considered a lower priority for the ego car's dynamic decision-making since they are not moving.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian walking along the right side of the road, near the parked vehicles, and facing away from the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the roadway and the parked cars poses a potential risk, as they might step into the path of the ego car unexpectedly, particularly if they are not aware of the vehicle's approach.\n\nFurthermore, the road ahead appears to be closed or access is restricted, as indicated by a red and white barrier with a banner in a non-English script. This barrier signals a change in normal traffic conditions and would directly impact the driving path of the ego car.\n\nTo complement the barrier, there are traffic cones placed in front of it, forming a line that restricts vehicle passage on that section of the road. These cones are guiding the traffic flow and indicating areas that are off-limits, which means the ego car may need to detour, stop, or slow down.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
