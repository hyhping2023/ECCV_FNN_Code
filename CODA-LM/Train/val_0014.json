The second vehicle is parked on the right side of the road by bicycles, static and not influencing the immediate driving behavior but requiring monitoring in case it enters traffic.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are three notable ones: a pedestrian on the right corner of the crosswalk, appearing stationary but needing observation for any sudden crossing; a cyclist on the right side, moving parallel to the ego car, whose sudden changes in speed or direction must be noted; and a delivery worker in a yellow jacket on a motor scooter, stopped at the crosswalk on the right, whose next movement could affect the ego car's path planning.\n\nThere is also a No Parking sign visible to the right of the traffic light, informing that stopping or parking is prohibited in that road section, influencing where temporary stops or drop-offs can occur.\n\nLastly, the traffic light ahead is green, allowing the ego car and other vehicles to move forward or turn if it's safe and legal to do so.\n\nNo traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."
