It is located in the center lane, going in the same direction as the ego vehicle, and is slightly ahead to the left. This vehicle is wider than a standard lane, which may cause flow restrictions and requires attention for a potential lane change.\n  - A white car is in the leftmost lane, overtaking the ego vehicle. The car's faster speed and trajectory indicate that it will soon create space in the left lane, which could be relevant if the ego vehicle needs to change lanes.\n  - A motorcycle is ahead in the rightmost lane, overtaking a parked car. Given their smaller size and dynamic maneuverability, motorcycles can often be less predictable and more vulnerable, requiring increased monitoring by the ego car.\n\n- **Traffic signs**:\n  - There is a directional sign overhead on the right, indicating lane destinations with arrows. This sign is vital for navigation and lane choice if a turn or lane change is anticipated.\n  - A blue traffic sign is visible to the left beyond the overhead bridge, indicating left turn and forward options. This sign provides essential navigation information for the ego vehicle, which might influence the lane selection in anticipation of approaching turns.\n\n- **Other objects**:\n  - There is a parked car in the rightmost lane where the motorcycle is passing. This could potentially obstruct the path and may require vehicles in that lane to merge left, which could affect the ego vehicle's trajectory."
