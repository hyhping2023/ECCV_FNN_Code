Firstly, there is a white van to the left of the ego vehicle, occupying the neighboring lane and crossing the intersection, which could affect the ego vehicle's path if it tries to change lanes or turn. Ahead of the ego vehicle, a silver sedan is stopped at the intersection due to a traffic signal, setting the pace for the ego vehicle which needs to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a white car is approaching the intersection from the opposite lane and should be watched for any unexpected turns.\n\nOn the right side, a cyclist wearing a blue top is riding in the opposite direction to the ego vehicle and could potentially make a turn, requiring monitoring. A pedestrian with a suitcase is crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle, moving towards the right, and has the right of way, so the ego vehicle must yield. Another pedestrian is waiting to cross on the right side of the ego vehicle and might enter the crosswalk, necessitating vigilance from the ego vehicle. There is also a cyclist in a pink jacket on the road to the right of the ego vehicle, heading away from the intersection, who doesn't immediately affect the ego vehicle's next actions but should be observed.\n\nThe traffic lights for the ego vehicle's lane are red, meaning the ego vehicle must stop and wait for them to turn green before proceeding. There are also white and red striped barriers to the left of the ego vehicle, indicating closed lanes or roadworks, signaling that the ego vehicle should not turn or change lanes to the left. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned in the scene."

Additionally, it is crucial to yield to the crossing pedestrian and be aware of the pedestrian waiting to cross, as well as keeping an eye on both cyclists' movements for any potential changes in traffic. Lane changes towards the left are not advised due to the barriers. The ego vehicle should maintain readiness to proceed when the signal changes, being vigilant not to encroach on the pedestrian crossing zone and respecting right-of-way rules."
