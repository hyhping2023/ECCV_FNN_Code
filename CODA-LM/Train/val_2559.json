While this parked car does not pose an immediate threat, it could potentially obstruct the road if traffic builds up.\n   - A large truck with a container on the back is stopped in the middle of the road. This truck is blocking part of the road, and the ego car will need to carefully navigate around it, ensuring enough space is left.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Orange traffic cones have been placed on the road near the stopped truck. These cones likely indicate a construction or road work zone, signaling the ego car to proceed with caution and potentially merge into the adjacent lane."

Featuring a high clearance and a cabin at the front for driving, this truck is carrying a load covered by a blue tarp, suggesting it might be hauling materials sensitive to weather. In this driving scenario, the presence of the truck, particularly if it is moving slowly or making a turn, can influence the ego car's speed and maneuvering decisions, necessitating increased caution, longer following distances, and possibly a lane change to maintain safe traffic flow.",

The vehicle's front is equipped with a large bucket, which could be used for digging or transporting heavy materials. In terms of driving behavior, this construction vehicle implies there could be nearby construction activity, leading the ego car to be alert for potential obstructions or delays in the traffic flow, unexpected stops, and workers in proximity to the roadway. The vehicles activities may also dictate changes in the typical traffic patterns, requiring heightened attention and possibly reduced speed from all nearby drivers.",

It may need to merge into the adjacent lane if the truck is blocking the entire lane. Additionally, the wet road conditions suggest adjusting the speed and following distance to account for reduced traction."
