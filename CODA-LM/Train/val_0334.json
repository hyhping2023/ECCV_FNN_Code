        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario depicted, we have several elements that must be considered for safe autonomous driving. To begin, there are vehicles including a black sedan parked on the side of the road just ahead on the right, which presents a potential risk if a passenger may open the door or if the vehicle starts to move into traffic unexpectedly. Along with this, there are a few other parked cars ahead on the right side that pose similar risks in terms of unexpected door openings or movements.\n\nThere is also a presence of multiple pedestrians walking on both sides of the road. These pedestrians could step onto the roadway at any moment, which necessitates the readiness of the autonomous car to slow down or halt to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, a blue informational traffic sign is noticed beside the road on the left. While this sign provides information about points of interest or directions and does not immediately affect the driving behavior, it could be a source of distraction for pedestrians that the autonomous vehicle must be cognizant of.\n\nNotably, a single orange traffic cone is placed in front of the parked black sedan, signaling a temporary alteration in usual traffic patterns or a potential hazard ahead, requiring the vehicle to remain alert and possibly adapt its course.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the observed scene that would impact the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions."
