It's facing the same direction as the ego car. Due to its location and potential for movement, it presents a navigational consideration for the ego car, which must be prepared for any unexpected maneuvers from this vehicle.\n\nPedestrians are present in the background on the sidewalk. They appear to not be crossing the street at the moment nor showing immediate intentions to do so. While they are not impacting driving decisions at this instant, the ego car's alert systems should be ready to react if any of these individuals decide to step onto the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a red pedestrian signal on the right side, which suggests that the vehicular traffic light may be green. Therefore, while the ego car can likely proceed, it should do so with caution, especially considering the potential movement of the pedestrians and the presence of the three-wheeled vehicle.\n\nThere are two traffic cones placed on the road, slightly to the left of the ego car's current lane. These traffic cones seem to demarcate an area for passage or indicate ongoing roadwork, necessitating careful navigation around them to continue safely on the path.\n\nNo traffic signs, barriers, or other objects are noted in the image that impact the driving decisions of the ego car."

The car should also navigate cautiously around the traffic cones set slightly to the left, being mindful of the road width and any possible obstructions they might be indicating. The ego car should monitor the traffic light for vehicles (not visible in the image) and proceed when safe to do so, taking into account the red pedestrian signal. Further attention should be paid to any pedestrians that may approach the crosswalk unexpectedly, despite the red signal for them."
