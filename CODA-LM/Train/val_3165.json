This vehicle's size and position necessitate careful consideration of following distance and speed to ensure safety, especially if the vehicle stops or slows down unexpectedly. Additionally, multiple cars are observed in adjoining lanes and ahead in moderate traffic, indicating the ego car needs to be vigilant about potential lane changes from these vehicles, which could impact its lane position and speed adjustments. Lastly, trees and bushes are present along the side of the road. While they don't directly influence driving decisions, they must be noted for environmental mapping and to anticipate possible unexpected movements, such as an animal or pedestrian emerging from behind them."

It is equipped with a rotating drum that keeps the concrete mixture correctly agitated until it is used at a construction site. The presence of such a heavy and slow-moving vehicle in traffic requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be cautious of sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle. The ego car should be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops in traffic flow, especially in areas close to construction sites.",
