Multiple vehicles are ahead in the same lane, indicating congested traffic and requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Directly ahead, a vehicle with red taillights suggests that it is either slow-moving or stopped, necessitating the ego car to be ready to halt or slow down.\n\nA pedestrian is observed next to a covered car on the right side, which could potentially step into the road, necessitating vigilance and readiness to stop.\n\nThere are several traffic cones to the right of the ego car, indicating roadwork or a closed section and suggesting that vehicles must not cross into this area.\n\nAdditionally, a covered car is parked on the sidewalk to the right. While not an immediate hazard, it is something to be mindful of in case someone moves around the vehicle."
