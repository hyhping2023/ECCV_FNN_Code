Additionally, there is a green and white directional sign on the right side of the road near construction materials, which provides directions that may be relevant if the ego vehicle needs to navigate to a particular destination or avoid construction areas.\n\nThe road also features multiple orange and white traffic cones in a line on the right, delineating a construction zone. These cones indicate that part of the road may be closed or unsafe to drive on, guiding the ego car to stay in its current lane. Concrete barriers are present on the right side of the road, partially enclosing a construction zone. These barriers restrict the drivable area, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and stay in the left lane.\n\nFurthermore, there is construction debris scattered around the right side of the road, which consists of potentially hazardous materials that could necessitate careful driving or lane changes. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other categories of road users present in the image."
