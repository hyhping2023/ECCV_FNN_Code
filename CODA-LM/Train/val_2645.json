This vehicle's presence necessitates maintaining a safe distance by the ego vehicle, ensuring it can react to any sudden movements or braking by the SUV to avoid potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there is a group of workers identified on the side of the road, all wearing high-visibility vests. These workers are classified as vulnerable road users, likely indicating the presence of a work zone or construction area. Consequently, the ego vehicle is advised to proceed with heightened caution, adhering to any temporary traffic control measures and being ready to slow down or halt for safety.\n\nThe presence of yellow warning cones further reinforces the possibility of a temporary work zone or another form of obstruction along the side of the road. This implies the necessity for the ego vehicle to remain vigilant, possibly needing to merge or change lanes proactively to navigate away from the cones and any associated work area safely.\n\nLastly, we observe a row of shrubs or hedges lining the side of the road. Although they do not influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior directly, they serve as an indicator of a lane divider or median, separating the traffic lanes.\n"
