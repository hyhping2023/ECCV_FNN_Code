This parked car is significant as it occupies part of the road, which could potentially narrow the drivable path for the ego car, requiring careful maneuvering.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian who seems to be walking along the right side of the road, just to the right of the parked car. The pedestrian is only partially visible, which heightens the risk of an accident due to the close proximity to the roadway combined with low visibility conditions. The ego car must exercise caution to ensure the safety of the pedestrian.\n\nLastly, there is a large blue object on the right side of the road, which is partially illuminated and could be a traffic sign or a structure. The exact nature of the object is unclear, but its presence could complicate navigation if it is near or encroaching onto the road. The ego car will need to identify and respond to this object appropriately to maintain a safe driving environment.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
