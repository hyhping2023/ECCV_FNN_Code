The presence of the sedan suggests that it may be waiting for a green traffic signal or for pedestrians to cross. Consequently, the ego car must also stop or slow down to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in the opposite lanes traveling perpendicular to the ego car's path. While these vehicles do not immediately impact the ego car's path, their presence requires vigilance in case any vehicle violates traffic rules.\n\nOn the right side facing the ego car, multiple traffic signs are visible, including No Entry for various vehicle types, posted speed limits, and directional signs. These signs are crucial as they provide instructions and information on permitted traffic movements and speed regulation, which the ego car is required to adhere to.\n\nThe traffic lights in view show a red signal for the lane the ego car is in, mandating that the ego car must stop and remain stationary until the light turns green.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones and barriers on the right side of the ego car, indicating that the lane is closed ahead. These cones and barriers serve to direct vehicles to stay in the correct lane for safe passage through the area, which the ego car should comply with.\n\nLastly, a fire hydrant is visible on the right roadside. However, it does not affect the immediate driving behavior as it is a fixed object positioned safely away from the lane of travel."
