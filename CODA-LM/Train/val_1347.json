This van, however, does not affect the driving behavior of our ego car since it is not blocking the path. Additionally, there are large spools of material situated alongside the road on the right side. Although not immediately obstructing the road, these spools represent a potential hazard. Therefore, the ego car should keep them under observation. Should these spools move towards the roadway, the ego car might need to take evasive action to avoid a collision. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the scene."

Additionally, the lack of road markings means the ego car should be prepared for any road users that may enter the roadway unexpectedly."
