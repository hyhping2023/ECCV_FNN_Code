A large vehicle, possibly a truck or a bus, is ahead on the right side with its taillights illuminated, indicating that it's moving away from the lane of the ego vehicle. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and be cautious of the vehicle's speed and braking distance, as larger vehicles can have unpredictable maneuvers due to their size.\n\nAdditionally, reflective road boundary markers line the sides of the road, highlighting the lane borders in conditions of low visibility. The ego vehicle should use these markers to ensure it remains centered in its lane, especially if the lanes are narrowing.\n\nSeveral traffic cones are positioned on the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, serving as a visual barrier and signifying potential road work or lane narrowing. The ego car should be vigilant and avoid drifting to the left near the cones.\n\nA continuous barrier runs along the right side of the road, creating a physical division between the lane of the ego vehicle and oncoming traffic or any adjacent areas. This barrier serves as a reminder for the ego vehicle to keep left, minimizing the risk of collisions with oncoming traffic that could be obscured by the barrier."
