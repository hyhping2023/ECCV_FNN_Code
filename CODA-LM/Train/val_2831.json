Traffic cones are generally used for traffic management by signaling alterations in driving routes or to indicate areas under construction, warning drivers to slow down or maneuver cautiously around or away from specific zones to maintain safety on the road. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone on the road will require the ego car to adjust its path to avoid it, ensuring that the vehicle does not drive over or too close to the cone. Such adjustments might include reducing speed or slightly altering the driving line to safely navigate past the cone while remaining on the road.",
