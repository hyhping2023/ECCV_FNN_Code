These vehicles appear to be stopped or moving slowly, as indicated by their activated brake lights. This situation requires the ego car to adjust its speed control and trajectory planning accordingly, since overtaking is not a feasible option at this moment due to oncoming traffic and strict lane demarcations preventing such maneuvers.\n\nTo the side of the road, on the sidewalk, pedestrians can be seen. Specifically, one individual seems to be in the process of entering or exiting the blue truck. Their presence demands heightened awareness as they could unexpectedly step into the roadway, thus the ego car must remain vigilant and prepared to come to a halt if necessary to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones have been set along the left edge of the ego car's lane. This arrangement forms a narrow path and suggests that there may be roadwork or some obstruction nearby. As a result, it is crucial for the ego car to moderate its speed and navigate cautiously to avoid the cones and any potential hazards associated with them.\n\nWooden railings are installed along the right side of the road, acting as a barrier between the vehicular traffic and the pedestrian zone. They provide a clear separation which reduces the likelihood of pedestrians unintentionally stepping onto the roadway. Nonetheless, the ego car should maintain a watchful eye for any unforeseen pedestrian movements.\n\nIn this scenario, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other miscellaneous objects are not present and hence do not impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
