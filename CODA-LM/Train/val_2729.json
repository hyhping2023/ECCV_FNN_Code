A prominent feature is a large cement truck with a rotating drum situated in the middle of the construction site. It is crucial to be aware that the cement truck may cross the path of the ego vehicle as it maneuvers around the work site in the course of its operation.\n\nAdjacent to the cement truck, there is a group of construction workers who are standing close by. The presence of these workers is a clear indicator of active construction. Their safety, as well as that of the ego vehicle, necessitates careful driving in the vicinity to prevent potential collisions or injuries.\n\nSurrounding the area, temporary traffic or construction barriers have been installed. These barriers serve to clearly mark the construction zone. They are a signal for vehicles to refrain from entering the marked off space, and thus, the ego vehicle should steer clear of this area.\n\nAnother vehicle on the site is a truck bearing the company name 'Putzmeister.' The truck's presence is associated with the ongoing construction activities and underscores the importance of prudent driving practices around this zone to accommodate for the presence of construction vehicles and personnel."
