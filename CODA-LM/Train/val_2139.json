        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several key elements affecting the ego car's driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there is a garbage truck with reflective markings on the back occupying the right lane directly in front of the ego vehicle, with its brake lights illuminated, indicating it is either slowing down or stopped. Since this large vehicle is directly in the ego car's path, the vehicle must either slow down or change lanes to avoid a collision. Additionally, there are assorted vehicles parked on the side of the road, including a white sedan, a gray hatchback, and various other cars situated to the left ahead of the ego car. These parked vehicles could pose potential obstructions if any doors open or if pedestrians step out from between them, requiring vigilant monitoring. Furthermore, there is oncoming traffic in the opposite lane, including buses and cars moving away from the ego car. While these vehicles are not in the immediate path of the ego vehicle, any sudden turns or lane changes made by them could affect traffic flow and safety conditions.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, a pedestrian wearing a reflective vest is working near the curb on the right side ahead, close to the parked garbage truck. The pedestrian's proximity to the traffic lane means that the ego car must be prepared to stop or slow down to ensure a safe passing distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are two orange traffic cones placed in front of the garbage truck, indicating some form of work or obstruction in the right lane ahead. The presence of these cones signals a need for the ego car to alter its course, most likely merging left to avoid the work zone."

The ego vehicle must also monitor the parked cars for any unexpected movements such as opening doors or pedestrians stepping into traffic. Furthermore, it should remain vigilant of the pedestrian working near the truck, allowing for a safe passing distance. Continued observation of oncoming traffic is necessary to react to any unexpected events, although none are immediate threats from the current view. It is also important to follow road rules and signals during this maneuver, although no specific signage or lights are visible in the current image."
