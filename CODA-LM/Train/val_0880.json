This barrier is used to restrict vehicle movements either to control traffic flow or to close off a section of the road for safety.

Positioned horizontally along the path where the vehicle is headed, it serves as a physical and visual deterrent, instructing drivers to stop or redirect their route. This barrier is important for the future driving behavior of the ego car as it likely indicates that the section of the road ahead is closed or unsafe for travel, prompting the driver to find an alternative route.",
