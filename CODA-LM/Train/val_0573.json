Several vehicles in the ego car's lane in front, all appearing to be stationary due to traffic or a red signal ahead.

Cars in the right lane parallel to the ego car, all heading in the same direction. The ego car should be mindful of these vehicles in case they decide to change lanes or if the ego car needs to change lanes.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. A pedestrian on the sidewalk to the left of the ego car, walking parallel to the road. The pedestrian's presence suggests a need for cautious driving, particularly in the event they decide to cross the road or step onto the carriageway.\n2.

This indicates a mandatory direction (possibly a lane designated for right turns or going straight), which the ego car should follow depending on the intended route.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n1. A traffic light visible in the distance displaying a green light, seeming to control the intersection the ego car is approaching. As the light is green, the ego car may proceed, but should remain alert as the light could change to yellow, signaling the need to prepare to stop.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n1. An array of orange and white traffic cones to the left, delineating a separate area on the road, perhaps indicating roadworks or a closed-off lane.
