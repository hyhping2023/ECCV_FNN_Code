        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, several road users and objects have been identified that affect the navigational decisions of the autonomous driving vehicle, termed here as the ego vehicle.\n\nStarting with the vehicles, there are three different parked vehicles each located on both sides of the road. On the right side, a black car is parked facing away from the ego vehicle, which may reduce the available driving space and possibly hide pedestrians or other vehicles that may emerge from behind it. Further ahead on the right, a white van is also parked facing the ego vehicle, presenting similar challenges in terms of reduced drivability and the potential for sudden movements or the opening of doors into the path of the ego vehicle. On the opposite side of the road, a blue truck is parked facing away from the ego vehicle, and it poses a risk by obstructing the view of oncoming traffic which requires additional caution from the ego vehicle to anticipate hidden pedestrians or vehicles.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a pedestrian is observed walking in the middle of the road towards the ego vehicle, positioned slightly to the right. This pedestrian's presence directly impacts the drivable path, necessitating that the ego vehicle slows down and prepares to stop if needed to ensure safety. Additionally, a small, light-colored dog is also present on the road in front of the ego vehicle, introducing unpredictability and necessitating caution to avoid potential collision. Lastly, there are two pedestrians on the left sidewalk, running parallel to the ego vehicle's path. Although they are not directly in the path, their proximity to the road requires monitoring by the ego vehicle in case they decide to cross the road or step onto it.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a directional arrow sign with a blue background is mounted on a building to the right, indicating a right turn ahead. This sign is crucial as it denotes an upcoming change in the road's direction, prompting the ego vehicle to potentially alter its course while being alert for other vehicles that might slow down or stop to make the turn.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects have been identified in this scene, indicating a clear path in these aspects for the ego vehicle, albeit with the need for vigilance due to the aforementioned vehicles and vulnerable road users."

It should be prepared to stop to let the pedestrian and the animal safely clear the road. Additionally, due to the potential for hidden hazards like doors opening from parked vehicles or people emerging from behind them, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and be vigilant of any sudden movements. Adjusting the driving path to the center of the road when safe, to allow for maximum reaction time to any of the observed risks, is recommended as well."
