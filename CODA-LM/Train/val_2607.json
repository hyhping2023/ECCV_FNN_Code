        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are multiple elements that require attention. Firstly, there is a forklift positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. Notably, the forklift does not have any load and has activated its hazard lights. This indicates that the forklift might be moving at a slower pace than other traffic or could come to an unexpected stop. Given these behaviors, it is essential for the ego vehicle to maintain a larger following distance and be prepared to react to any sudden changes in the forklift's speed or position.\n\nAdditionally, the road is shared with a variety of other vehicles including cars and buses, which are both parked and in motion along the sides of the road. This results in a constrained passage that demands cautious navigation from the ego vehicle. The presence of these vehicles carries the risk that they could make unanticipated moves or that their doors might open unexpectedly. Consequently, the ego vehicle must remain alert and modify its travel path with care to safely navigate through the enviroment."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, likely a small excavator or similar heavy machinery used for construction work. The vehicle is equipped with visible safety lights, which suggest that it is actively engaged in construction activities or preparing to move across or along the road. This might influence the driving behavior of the ego car by indicating the need to reduce speed and proceed with caution. The presence of such a vehicle typically signals the possibility of nearby construction work, which may involve temporary changes in traffic patterns, potential obstacles, or workers near the roadway. It is important for the driver to stay vigilant, watch for any posted construction signs, and possibly prepare to stop or change lanes if necessary to accommodate the safe passage of the construction vehicle and to navigate through the construction zone safely.",

Monitor for any sudden stops and be prepared to navigate around it if safe to do so. Drive cautiously through the narrow passage created by the vehicles parked along the roadway, and remain alert for any potential hazards from them, such as doors opening or people stepping out. Given the clear road conditions, continue to follow standard driving practices while being vigilant of the dynamic environment."
