        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene in question is devoid of vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers. However, it does present a unique set of aspects that are crucial for the autonomous navigation of the ego car. Foremost, there are several yellow traffic cones aligned on the right side of the scene. These cones are dimly illuminated by nearby lighting, indicating a potential road work area or a lane closure. This setup necessitates a reduction in speed by the ego car and possibly requires it to merge left or stay alert for changes in the traffic pattern, showcasing the need for adaptability and safety in navigation.\n\nAdditionally, there is a light pole situated on the right, with potentially attached signage that isn't clearly visible due to the low lighting conditions. While the light pole doesn't directly influence driving behavior, its presence emphasizes the importance of the ego car's awareness of street furniture to maintain a safe distance from the roadside. This highlights the critical nature of situational awareness and the need for autonomous systems to anticipate and react to less obvious hazards or road use elements."

The cone is orange with a reflective white band, making it visible during nighttime. Its placement suggests there might be construction, a detour, or areas of the street that are temporarily closed for vehicle passage. This object influences the ego car's driving behavior by potentially necessitating a slow down or maneuver to avoid the restricted area where the cone is placed.",
