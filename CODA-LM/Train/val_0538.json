These traffic cones serve as a visual warning to the ego car to avoid entering the restricted area.\n\nLastly, green and white striped traffic barriers are installed adjacent to the cones and extend along the left edge of the road. These barriers indicate to the ego car that there may be road works or a closed lane ahead, necessitating that the car must remain in the open lane to the right.\n\nThere are no traffic lights nor any other objects mentioned in the report for this traffic scene."
