These vehicles limit the ego car's ability to maneuver laterally, and there is a need to be cautious of potential lane changes by these cars.\n\nA cyclist has fallen near the roadside on the right, with another individual standing close by. This situation suggests a recent accident or obstruction, potentially impacting the behavior of nearby traffic and possibly necessitating the ego car to change its path to avoid the area.\n\nOn the left, there is a directional sign indicating a left turn lane, and above it, a 'no parking' sign is visible. These signs provide guidance on lane usage and parking restrictions, which will influence the ego car's lane choice.\n\nThe traffic lights include a green light straight ahead, signaling that the ego car can proceed, and a red arrow signal indicating that left turns are currently prohibited. The ego car should continue straight and not attempt a left turn.\n\nTraffic cones are set up around the cyclist's accident on the right side of the road, marking a potential hazard area. This may cause traffic to shift left, away from the accident scene.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects reported in the image."
