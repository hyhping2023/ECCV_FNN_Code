However, there is a red traffic light visible on the right side, mounted next to a barrier. It indicates that the ego car must stop and wait for the light to change before proceeding. Alongside, black and yellow striped traffic cones are aligned on the left side, indicating a delimited path for the ego vehicle. These cones are guiding the traffic flow and suggesting that the ego car should follow a path to the right of the cones. Furthermore, a yellow barrier is present directly ahead, signaling a no-entry zone or checkpoint. The ego car must stop at this barrier and cannot proceed until the barrier is lifted or permission is granted. Lastly, there is a guard booth with a person inside to the left of the ego car, possibly indicating a controlled access point. This suggests the need for interaction, possibly with a guard or an access control mechanism, before proceeding."

It typically consists of a pole or bar suspended at a suitable height to block vehicles and can be manually or mechanically operated. In this case, the barrier appears to be in a lowered position which suggests it is actively blocking the road. The presence of this barrier influences the driving behavior by necessitating a stop or a diversion, since the blocked road cannot be accessed until the barrier is raised.",
