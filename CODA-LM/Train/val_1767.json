However, there is a barrier gate deployed horizontally across the road, which indicates that the road is closed to vehicular traffic due to potential reasons like construction, security measures, or access control to a facility. Additionally, an illuminated guardhouse is located on the left side of the barrier gate, housing a security guard, signifying that this is likely a controlled access point, perhaps leading to a private or restricted area."

Its presence indicates that the area ahead may be restricted or that there is controlled access to a specific part of the street, possibly due to construction or special event.

Traffic cones are employed to guide vehicles by delineating driving lanes, redirecting traffic, or signaling areas that are temporarily hazardous or under maintenance. For the ego car, it signals the need to either reduce speed or adjust the lane position to safely navigate around whatever the cones are marking, often affecting the traffic flow and driving patterns.",
