Directly in front of the ego car, within the same lane, is a white BMW sedan whose speed and distance are crucial for maintaining a safe following distance and controlling the ego vehicle's speed.\n\nA speed limit sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating a maximum speed of 80 km/h, information necessary for the ego car to comply with the legal speed limitations. Traffic lights are also present on the right; however, their signals are not currently visible or are obstructed from the ego car's line of sight, meaning the ego car needs to be prepared to stop or proceed based on the light's state when it becomes visible.\n\nConcrete barriers flank both sides of the ego car's lane, signalling limited maneuvering space, possibly indicating a no-overtaking zone or a construction area. Additionally, there is a toll booth on the right, accompanied by a traffic cone, pointing to a location where vehicles are expected to decelerate or halt to pay tolls, a condition that could disrupt the flow of traffic and demands increased attention from the ego car.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic cones outside of the toll booth scenario, or other objects of relevance."
