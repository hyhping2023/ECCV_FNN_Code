        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several key elements are present that significantly influence the driving conditions and decisions of the ego vehicle. Firstly, a white van is directly in front of the ego vehicle within the same lane, necessitating maintaining a safe following distance and readiness to adjust speed or stop correspondingly. Additionally, the presence of various cars in adjacent lanes and across the intersection, both moving and stationary, requires vigilant observation due to the potential for these vehicles to alter the traffic flow or change lanes unexpectedly.\n\nFurthermore, pedestrians are noted on the sidewalk to the left of the ego vehicle. Although they are not currently in the crosswalk, their proximity to it suggests the need for monitoring in case they decide to enter the roadway.\n\nTraffic signs contribute to the navigational cues within the scene, including a 'No Parking' sign to the right of the ego vehicle and a round blue sign with a white arrow indicating a mandatory right turn beyond the intersection. These signs are pivotal for informing drivers about parking regulations and mandatory travel directions, aiding in route planning.\n\nThe traffic condition is also defined by the state of traffic lights, with a green signal visible and directly facing the ego vehicle's route, indicating the allowance for traffic in the ego vehicle's lane to proceed through the intersection.\n\nLastly, the scene includes red and white traffic cones arranged to the right of the ego vehicle, delineating a closed area of the road. The placement of these cones is crucial as it indicates restrictions on vehicle access to part of the roadway, likely leading to modifications in traffic arrangement and possibly resulting in narrower lanes.\n\nIn summary, the traffic scene presents a comprehensive ensemble of road users and navigational aids, each contributing to the overall traffic dynamics and necessitating careful consideration by the ego vehicle to ensure safe and compliant navigation through the environment."

Traffic cones are typically used to mark temporary traffic lanes or to alert drivers to potential hazards or areas of construction.
