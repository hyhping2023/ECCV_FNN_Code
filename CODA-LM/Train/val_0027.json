        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, various road users and objects are present, requiring careful navigation. Firstly, there's a blue truck parked on the right side, which is partially hidden from the ego car's view by a construction barrier. The stationary position of the truck near the travel path could potentially create an obstruction or it might move onto the roadway, posing a challenge for navigational adjustments.\n\nIn addition to the vehicle, two workers wearing red safety helmets are noticeable. One is situated closer to the foreground on the right, attentively looking towards a pile of uninstalled construction materials, while the other stands further back, near the parked blue truck. The presence of these workers near or on the roadway signifies a risk to the ego car's intended route, as their movements could be unpredictable and may interrupt the flow of traffic.\n\nTo further complicate navigation, a directional sign with an arrow pointing left is present. This sign, mounted on a temporary stand in the middle of the road, signals an upcoming detour or turn-off, indicating a change in traffic pattern that the ego car must follow. Such signs are critical for guiding vehicles through altered or unpredictable roadways.\n\nLastly, the scene includes green construction barriers lining the right side of the road. These barriers mark the boundary of an off-limits construction area. They play a crucial role in delineating the construction zone, restricting access to it, and potentially narrowing the lanes available for the ego car to maneuver, thus requiring the car to adjust its path accordingly.\n\nAltogether, these elements combine to form a dynamic and complex driving environment, necessitating heightened awareness and adaptability from the autonomous driving system to safely navigate through the depicted scenario."

It is put in place to separate the active construction area from the area that is accessible to vehicles and pedestrians. The barrier visually indicates that the ego car cannot pass through this zone and must find an alternative route.
