This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop.\n   - A lime green taxi is on the left side, slightly ahead of the ego car, moving at a similar speed or slightly faster. This could influence the ego car's decisions if lane changes or overtaking are considered.\n\n2. **Vulnerable road users:**\n   - There is a pedestrian crossing signage on the right, indicating that there may be pedestrians around or ahead who could potentially cross the street. The ego car must be alert and ready to yield to pedestrians.\n\n3. **Traffic signs:**\n   - Directional signs are above on the right-hand side, indicating road directions or exits that may affect the ego vehicle's route planning. The ego car may need to make navigation decisions based on these signs, affecting lane choice and turning maneuvers.\n\n4. **Traffic cones:**\n   - Traffic cones and temporary barriers are present on the right side of the road, indicating possible road work or lane restrictions. This requires the ego car to adjust its lateral position accordingly.\n\n5. **Barriers:**\n   - Temporary fencing along the right side of the road possibly indicates construction or closed areas. These barriers help define the driving path and limit the usable road space, requiring the ego car to stay within the designated lanes.\n\n6. **Other objects:**\n   - There are no visible debris or other objects on the road that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car. This means fewer unexpected adjustments are needed for the ego car."
