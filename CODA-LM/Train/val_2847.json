The size and position of the truck limit maneuverability and visibility for the ego car, which is an important consideration for the autonomous driving system. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the right side, riding in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist means that the ego car may need to adjust its trajectory or speed to safely accommodate the cyclist's potential movements.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a blue directional sign on the right side indicating a highway entry ahead. This sign is important as it suggests the presence of merging traffic, potentially affecting the ego car's lane choice. There is also a yellow warning sign on the right side, indicating a merging lane from the right, which means the ego car should be prepared for vehicles that may enter its lane.\n\nLastly, there is a standing road sign with a no parking symbol on the left side of the road. This sign indicates that parking is not allowed in the area, providing the ego car with information about the road rules in the vicinity.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, as indicated by the empty categories in the JSON data."
