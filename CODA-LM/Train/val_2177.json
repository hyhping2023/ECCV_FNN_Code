There is one white car approaching from the opposite direction, which is not an immediate threat but should be monitored in case it crosses into the ego car's lane or behaves unpredictably. \n\nOn the left side of the road, there are yellow directional signs with arrows attached to a barrier. These signs indicate a change in the road layout or a detour, guiding traffic around a potential obstacle or construction zone. Alongside these signs, there are also barriers on the left side of the road that suggest a road work area or a closed lane, necessitating caution and potential lane adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, several large yellow boulders or blocks are present on the side of the road, serving as a warning to prevent vehicles from driving through potentially hazardous or off-limits areas and should not be ignored."
