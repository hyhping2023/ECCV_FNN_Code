It is equipped with various heavy equipment and machinery visible on its back, such as what appears to be a crane or lifting device. The presence of this type of vehicle in traffic can influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle by necessitating increased caution and potentially slower speeds. The ego car may need to maintain a greater following distance to allow for sudden stops or movements from the construction vehicle, and be prepared for possible lane obstructions or shifts due to the vehicle's operations.",

Avoid unnecessary lane changes near the median barrier and continue to monitor the road conditions for any changes. Drive defensively in anticipation of possible braking or turning maneuvers by vehicles ahead."
