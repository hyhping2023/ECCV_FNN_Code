This red light requires the ego car to stop in order to comply with traffic regulations.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones placed on the right edge of the road. These cones mark the end of the lane or indicate a no-entry or construction zone. The presence of these cones may reduce the available driving space and suggest that the ego car should proceed with caution.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
