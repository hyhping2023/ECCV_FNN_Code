        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles that are particularly noteworthy. Directly in front of the ego car is a cement mixer truck, which is easily recognizable by its rear discharge chute and hatch. The truck is grey with red and white reflective tape on its rear bumper. Due to its large size and its position on the road, it is crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nTo the left and slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a light grey multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) with its brake lights illuminated. The activation of the brake lights suggests that the traffic ahead may be slowing down or coming to a stop, which means the ego car must proceed with caution and be prepared to adjust its speed accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue sanitation truck in the lane to the right of the ego car. It stands out with its blue and white color scheme and reflective striping. The nature of the sanitation truck's work could lead to sudden stops or movements, so it is important for the ego car to stay vigilant and ready to react to any unexpected changes in the truck's behavior.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, indicating that these elements are not present or not affecting the driving conditions for the ego car at this moment."

For the ego car, this type of vehicle can influence driving behaviour by potentially reducing speed or maintaining a safe following distance since construction vehicles may stop unexpectedly or make sudden movements related to construction activity.",

In driving scenarios, the presence of a cyclist directly impacts the ego car's driving behaviour by necessitating increased caution, slower speeds, and readiness to yield, especially in urban or residential areas. It is essential for preventing any potential accidents and ensuring the safety of more vulnerable road users.",

Monitor the lanes on either side for any possible lane changes by the large vehicles that could impact the ego car's path. Stay vigilant for any movements from the sanitation truck, as these can be unpredictable and may require the ego car to adapt its positioning or speed."
