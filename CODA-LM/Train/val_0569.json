This vehicle's location and movement are crucial as they will directly influence the ego car's speed and the distance it needs to maintain behind the SUV for safety reasons.\n\nOn the right side of the ego vehicle, there is a cyclist riding in the same direction. The presence of the cyclist necessitates that the ego car keeps a safe distance and remains vigilant for any sudden movements the cyclist might make, ensuring the safety of both the cyclist and the occupants of the ego car.\n\nVisible on the left side of the road is a pedestrian crossing sign. This sign is an important indicator of the potential presence of pedestrians crossing or about to cross the road, signaling the need for the ego car to enhance its awareness and readiness to stop or slow down as needed.\n\nThe scene also includes orange traffic cones arranged in a line on both sides of the lane, effectively creating a narrowed path for vehicles. These cones are guiding the traffic flow, requiring the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a central position within the lane to navigate through the area safely.\n\nAdditionally, green fences are installed on both sides of the road, signifying a construction zone or a closed area. These barriers reduce the available road width and access, compelling the ego car to proceed with increased caution to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nIn this traffic scenario, there are no traffic lights or other objects mentioned, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the driving conditions and behavior required by the ego car in this specific situation."
