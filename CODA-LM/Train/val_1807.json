Its prominent components include a rotating drum, chutes, and various mechanical parts. This vehicle's presence and operation on the road influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle by requiring extra caution and awareness due to its large size, potential to make sudden stops, or make wide turns. It is crucial for the driver to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected movements.",
