        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are a few notable objects and road users impacting the driving environment. Firstly, there is a white utility truck parked on the right side of the road, equipped with rear warning lights. The truck's parking position and its illuminated warning lights suggest the likelihood of roadwork or a utility job in the vicinity, which could pose a temporary obstruction on the road. Additionally, a teal sedan is also parked on the right side of the road, further ahead of the observing vehicle. The presence of this parked sedan narrows the drivable width of the road, necessitating cautious maneuvering when passing by.\n\nConcerning traffic signage, there is an obscured sign located on the right side of the road, partially hidden behind a tree. The specific details of the sign are not discernible; however, its existence indicates that there might be important driving regulations or warnings applicable to this stretch of the road, affecting driving behavior.\n\nFurthermore, a series of yellow traffic cones can be seen on the right side of the road, arranged in a line that leads up to the parked utility truck. These cones serve a critical function in guiding traffic away from the utility work area and the parked truck, effectively reducing the available lane space for vehicles. They act as visual cues to alert drivers, including the ego-vehicle, of the modified road layout and potential hazards ahead.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, and miscellaneous objects do not feature any entries in this particular scene, suggesting their absence or irrelevance to the current driving scenario."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is commonly used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or when road incidents occur. For the ego vehicle, this cone indicates that it should possibly adjust its path to avoid the area designated by the cone, suggesting there might be hazards or obstructions ahead.",
