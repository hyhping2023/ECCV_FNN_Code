        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large, beige-colored dump truck on the right side of the field of view. It occupies most of the lane adjacent to the ego vehicle, and its upper structure is notably higher than the bed of the truck. The truck appears to have been recently used, as indicated by the dirt present on parts of its body. The dump truck's size and proximity to the ego vehicle may present a potential hazard, particularly if it were to make any sudden movements or if debris were to fall from it. Additionally, the truck could obstruct the view to the right side of the ego vehicle, making it challenging to see and anticipate the actions of other road users that might be concealed behind it. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction truck, typically used for transporting heavy materials such as sand, gravel, or demolition debris. It features a robust, articulated dump body which can be raised and lowered for unloading materials. In a traffic scenario, a truck of this kind usually moves slower and makes wide turns. Awareness of its movement is crucial as it can affect traffic flow and requires maintaining a safe following distance to accommodate sudden stops or turns.",

The ego vehicle should also be wary of any potential debris falling from the truck and should be cautious not to pass it aggressively, considering the limited visibility around such a large vehicle."
