Although the exact content is not visible, its presence necessitates attention for potential directives or warnings.\n\nAhead, a traffic light is visible with a green light illuminated, indicating that vehicles, including the ego car, are currently allowed to move through the intersection.

The construction vehicle can influence driving behavior by its slower speed and frequent stops, especially near construction sites. Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle. In this scenario, the ego vehicle must be cautious, ensuring there is enough space to avoid accidents and consider changing lanes if possible to bypass the construction vehicle.",
