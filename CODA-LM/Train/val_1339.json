The vehicles identified include a red sports car parked on the right side of the road, which may obstruct part of the lane and reduce visibility for the ego car when navigating around it. Additionally, a white SUV is facing the ego direction on the right side of the road, parked incorrectly and obstructing traffic flow, requiring the ego car to carefully avoid this obstacle. Moreover, various vehicles are parked on the side of the road in the distance, signaling a busy area that necessitates the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution.\n\nWhile no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights are noted in this scenario, orange traffic cones are placed in the right lane. These cones are guiding traffic to keep left, indicating a road hazard or construction ahead. Furthermore, yellow and black temporary barriers are located right in the ego lane, signaling a closed lane ahead possibly due to road work or an accident. This situation necessitates the ego car to merge left.\n\nLastly, there is debris on the road near the traffic cones, presenting a potential hazard. The ego car must exercise caution to avoid this debris and ensure vehicle safety."
