This vehicle necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and observe its brake lights to determine if it needs to slow down or stop.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are orange traffic cones and yellow barriers indicating road work or a lane closure. These objects define the construction zone, potentially reducing the usable width of the road and requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and possibly merge to the left if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, temporary yellow construction barriers are occupying part of the right lane. These barriers signify a partial lane blockage, implying that the ego car might need to merge lanes if required by the conditions.\n\nFurthermore, beyond the barriers on the right-hand side, there is construction equipment. Although not directly on the road, the proximity of this equipment to the drivable area necessitates that the ego car remains alert for any sudden movements or the presence of workers entering the roadway."
