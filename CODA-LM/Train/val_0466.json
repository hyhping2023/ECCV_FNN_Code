Above the road, directional signs indicate lane directions for going straight and turning left or right, helping the ego car determine the appropriate lane for its intended maneuver. Additionally, a green traffic light is visible above the road for vehicles in the left lanes, indicating that these lanes have the right of way to proceed or turn.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed to the right side of the truck, guiding traffic away from the work zone, implying that part of the road is closed off and necessitating a lane change for the ego car. Next to these cones, road workers and a road work sign indicate ongoing maintenance, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and potentially at a slower speed to ensure safety."
