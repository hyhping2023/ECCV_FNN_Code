        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles and some road-side hazards that are of interest. Directly in front of the ego car is a large, white cement mixer truck. It is moving in the same direction as the ego car and occupies much of the lane. The cement mixer truck exhibits signs of wear such as abrasions and leftover construction materials. Due to the truck's size and proximity, it could potentially obstruct visibility for those behind, including the ego car, and make it difficult to overtake safely.\n\nFurther ahead of the cement mixer, there is a white sedan also traveling in the same direction. The presence of the sedan is a sign of the traffic flow and might require the ego car to adjust its speed to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the side of the road, there are hazardous materials, specifically piles of bricks or building blocks, some of which are perilously close to the edge of the driving lane. These hazards could lead to an obstruction of the drivable area and might cause distractions. It is important for the ego car to be vigilant and monitor the edge of the lane closely to avoid these hazards. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this scene."

It is a large, heavy vehicle equipped with a rotating drum used for mixing and transporting concrete. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates potential construction nearby, which might involve occasional stops or slow driving to navigate around construction sites. For the ego car, it means maintaining a safe distance, being prepared for sudden stops, and being cautious of construction workers and material that could be present on the road.",

Monitor the speed and distance of the white sedan ahead. Overtaking should be approached with caution, especially considering the limited visibility and potential oncoming traffic. The absence of lane markings requires extra attention to maintaining proper lane discipline. Be vigilant for any movement from the side of the road, especially near the stacks of bricks which could suggest the presence of workers or unexpected obstacles entering the roadway."
