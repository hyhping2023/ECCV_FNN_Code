However, a vulnerable road user is present; a person stands near the middle of the road, facing away from the ego car. This is significant because the person could unpredictably move in any direction, presenting a potential risk to the autonomous vehicle.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs or traffic lights to consider, a traffic cone is located to the left side of the road, near the sidewalk. This cone may signal the presence of a hazard or denote an area that is off-limits to vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier positioned on the left side of the road, which partly blocks the sidewalk. This barrier reduces the available width of the road and could signify ongoing construction or a restricted area up ahead.\n\nLastly, unrelated to the immediate path of the ego vehicle, there is a wooden booth or structure situated at the side of the road, right behind where the standing person is located. This object, while not directly an obstacle, might be associated with a temporary event that could impact the state of the road."
