A white SUV is in the right lane beside the ego car, approximately one car length ahead, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be alert for potential lane changes by the SUV. Directly in front of the ego car, there is a small white truck commanding the immediate pace, necessitating close monitoring of its speed and brake lights for safe driving. Additionally, various cars in adjacent lanes and ahead of the ego car affect the overall traffic density and flow, which must be considered for maneuver planning.\n\nA motorcyclist is identified in the far right side of the right lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. This motorcyclist, being a vulnerable road user, requires extra caution from the ego car, especially if the motorcyclist changes lanes or if the ego car intends to shift lanes.\n\nThe right edge of the right lane is marked by orange traffic cones, delineating a boundary between the road and a construction zone. These cones indicate a reduced lane width and necessitate that the ego car maintains a safe distance to avoid collision and respect the work zone."
