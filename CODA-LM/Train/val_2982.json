        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, a significant feature is the presence of white and orange traffic cones arranged in a line. These traffic cones are indicative of a lane closure or road work ahead. The critical reason they impact driving behavior is their suggestion that a section of the road is temporarily closed off, either due to safety concerns or ongoing construction activities. Consequently, this requires the ego car to adjust its lane position to safely navigate past the affected area. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or additional objects noted in this specific scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used to mark temporary traffic patterns, hazards, or guide traffic around construction zones. Its high visibility color and reflective strips make it easily noticeable, serving as an indicator for drivers to slow down or maneuver carefully around the designated area. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests potential obstructions or changes in the usual traffic flow, prompting the driver of the ego car to remain alert and possibly adjust their route or speed to safely navigate past this point.",

It is generally orange with a reflective band to increase its visibility, particularly during low light conditions like nighttime or fog. The presence of a traffic cone in this driving scenario indicates that the ego car should proceed with caution, potentially adjusting speed or changing lanes to safely navigate past the area marked by the cone.",
