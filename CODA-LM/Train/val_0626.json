There are two parked vehicles: a white van on the right, with its rear facing the ego vehicle and a person nearby, apparently unloading goods. This could obstruct the ego vehicle's path or prompt sudden movements, requiring cautious driving. On the left, there's a gray car with a pedestrian walking between it and the ego vehicle. The car limits the available road space, and the pedestrian could move unpredictably, creating a potential danger.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene include a pedestrian wearing a white hat, walking away from the ego vehicle on the right side near the parked van. Their actions may be unforeseen and pose a risk of entering the ego vehicle's path. A cyclist is seen preparing to cross the road with a loaded bicycle, looking toward the ego vehicle, possibly indicating an intention to cross and thus necessitating that the ego vehicle yield or stop. Another pedestrian has crossed the road in front of the gray car on the left, hinting at ongoing pedestrian traffic that needs close attention.\n\nThere are also crates on the ground near the parked white van, signifying surrounding activity and indicating they could be obstacles. These crates can restrict maneuvering options and compel the ego vehicle to stay alert to stop or detour around them.\n\nThe image does not include any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers to consider in this driving scenario."
