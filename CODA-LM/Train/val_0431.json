Firstly, there is a silver sedan parked on the right side of the road, facing the ego car and partially on the pedestrian crossing area. This vehicle is improperly parked, which could potentially block the right-of-way for other vehicles and pedestrians. Additionally, there is a white SUV parked legally further to the right of the silver sedan on the road side, facing the same direction as the ego car. This SUV should not affect the driving behavior of the ego car. On the left side road shoulder, there are several cars parked facing away from the ego car. While these vehicles are parked and do not pose an immediate risk, their presence should be noted for situational awareness.\n\nRegarding road signs, there is a directional sign on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, indicating a left bend ahead. This sign is important as it alerts the ego car to stay alert and prepare to navigate the upcoming bend in the road.\n\nLastly, there are portable guard rails on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, which separate the pedestrian area from the road. These guard rails suggest that pedestrians may be present and thus require the ego car to drive cautiously.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
