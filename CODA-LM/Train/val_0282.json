This car dictates the follow speed and may require the ego vehicle to adjust its speed or prepare to stop if the car decelerates. Further down the road on the right side, behind the construction barriers, a red truck is visible. Although this truck doesn't immediately affect the ego car's lane, its presence could indicate potential traffic or obstacles ahead.\n\nOn the right edge of the ego vehicle's lane, there is a motorcyclist travelling in the same direction. The presence of the motorcyclist close to the lane requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for unexpected maneuvers.\n\nThere are also temporary orange construction signs on the right side of the road indicating roadwork ahead. These signs suggest the potential for altered traffic patterns, which could require the ego vehicle to reduce speed and be alert for workers or equipment on the road.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are positioned along the right side of the ego car's lane, funneling traffic to the left. These cones indicate a construction zone and reduced lane width, requiring the ego car to stay within the modified lane boundaries. Furthermore, temporary construction barriers are present on both sides of the road, creating a narrowed driving path. These barriers limit the maneuverable space on the road and highlight a need for increased attention to lane positioning."

This bollard appears to be installed at the edge of the road to prevent vehicles from entering an area that is likely restricted or under construction. As part of the future driving behavior of the ego car, the driver should maintain a safe distance from the bollard to prevent any potential contact that could cause damage to the vehicle. This bollard serves as a visual cue to drivers to stay within the designated lane. The ego car must navigate the road while avoiding the restricted area that the bollard is protecting.",
