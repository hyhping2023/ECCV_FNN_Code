As such, drivers should be cautious since the forklift might affect the vehicle's path if it moves onto the roadway or engages in loading or unloading activities.\n\nThe traffic light in the image is green for the direction the ego vehicle is traveling, granting it the right of way to proceed. However, there is a need for caution because of the potential movement of the nearby forklift, which could cross into the vehicleâ€™s path.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green barrier on the right-hand side of the road. This barrier may be associated with a construction zone or may serve as a road partition, which could limit the number of available lanes and restrict the maneuverability of the ego vehicle. As the vehicle passes near such barriers, careful driving is essential to maintain safety. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects identified in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

It appears to be either parked or operating slowly in urban traffic. The presence of this construction vehicle suggests ongoing construction or transport of materials nearby. Its slower speed and possible sudden stops or turns influence the ego car's driving behavior, necessitating increased awareness and readiness to reduce speed or change lanes to maintain safe driving conditions.",
