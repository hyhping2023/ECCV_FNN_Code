The explanation for the vehicle's inclusion in the data is that while the parked car does not pose an immediate threat, it is still crucial for the ego car to be cognizant of the vehicle's presence. Consequently, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to ensure safe passage by the parked car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the scene."

Trucks are significant due to their size and slower acceleration and deceleration properties. The presence of this truck on the road affects the driving behavior of nearby vehicles, including the ego car. Drivers might need to maintain a greater following distance and prepare for potential slow-downs caused by the truck's movements, especially during overtaking or when the truck is making turns.",
