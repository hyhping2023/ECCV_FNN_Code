Directly in front, there is a white sedan that could be either stationary or moving slowly, likely waiting to proceed. The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to adjust its movement and speed accordingly, especially if the sedan's brake lights suggest it is slowing down or coming to a stop. \n\nTo the left in an adjacent lane, a green taxi is moving parallel to the ego car. This taxi must be kept under observation to maintain a safe distance, and its movements are to be watched in case it attempts to change lanes.\n\nOn the right side of the road ahead, a pedestrian crossing sign suggests that there might be pedestrians intending to cross the street, prompting the ego car to approach with caution and possibly reduce speed if necessary. Additionally, alongside this sign, there are directional signs that provide navigation information but do not directly influence the immediate driving decisions.\n\nAreas marked by orange traffic cones indicate construction on the right side of the ego car. The ego car needs to stay in its lane and control its speed to safely navigate past the construction zone without entering it.\n\nAlso on the right, a series of barriers demarcate a construction or restricted area. These barriers are a signal for the ego car to keep clear of potential hazards by remaining out of that part of the road.\n\nThe road scene does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects that must be considered by the ego car at this moment."
