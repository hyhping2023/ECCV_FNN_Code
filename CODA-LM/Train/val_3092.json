        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are multiple vehicles parked along both sides of the road, with the majority on the left-hand side. These vehicles display various colors such as white, black, and blue. The presence of parked vehicles reduces the navigable width of the road for the ego car, which calls for cautious driving particularly when encountering oncoming traffic to avoid potential hazards. Additionally, there is a dog positioned in the middle of the road in front of the ego car. The dog could potentially alter the driving behavior of the ego vehicle since animals can behave unpredictably, and this may necessitate the driver to adjust speed or engage in emergency braking to prevent an accident. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this traffic image."
