        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are influencing the driving behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there is a white sedan directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the center of the driving lane. This vehicle is important as it dictates the following distance and speed for the ego car and could potentially brake or change lanes, requiring the ego car to respond accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a tanker truck is positioned ahead in the left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The size and weight of the tanker truck mean it may decelerate slower and has larger blind spots. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe distance and exercise caution if a lane change is needed.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a directional sign on the right side indicating that a right turn is prohibited. This affects the ego car's route planning as right turns are not allowed at this junction. Another sign, a blue one with an arrow pointing upwards, informs the ego car that the lane ahead goes straight, indicating that the ego car should maintain its lane position to proceed forward. Additionally, there are signs indicating a detour or roadwork ahead on the right, which suggests that there may be an upcoming change in traffic patterns. The ego car may need to adjust its speed or change lanes in response to these conditions.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are placed on the right side, partially blocking the right-most lane. These cones typically indicate that part of the road may be closed off for construction or another road obstruction, signaling the ego car to avoid the obstructed lane.\n\nLastly, temporary fencing barriers are observed alongside the traffic cones on the right side of the road. These barriers further reinforce the partial closure of the lane and guide the ego car to stay in the open lanes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
