The size and position of the truck may obscure the view ahead, necessitating a safe following distance to accommodate for the truck's potential movements or sudden stops. Additionally, several cars are present in the adjacent lanes and on the opposite side of the road, which could intersect paths with the ego vehicle at the junction. These cars require careful attention as they may affect the ego vehicle's ability to safely change lanes or navigate the junction.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians are visible. While they are not currently entering the roadway, their proximity to the street means the ego vehicle must be ready to yield or stop if they step onto the road. A motorcyclist is also observed in the left side mirror, sharing the road with the ego vehicle. The presence of the motorcyclist calls for increased awareness and caution, particularly when the ego vehicle is changing lanes or turning, due to the motorcycle's smaller size and different maneuvering capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light displaying a red signal is situated above the junction on a gantry, directly in the path of the ego vehicle. The red light requires the ego vehicle to stop at the junction and wait for the signal to turn green before proceeding.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Additionally, awareness of the pedestrians on the right sidewalk is necessary in case any decide to cross the street. No immediate lane changes should be made until the traffic light turns green and the adjacent road users' intentions are apparent, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed safely through the junction."
