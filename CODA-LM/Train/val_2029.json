The first is located on the left lane, with its brake lights on, signaling that it might be slowing down or stopping. To ensure safe driving, the ego car must monitor the speed and distance of this vehicle to adjust its speed accordingly. The second vehicle is a larger one, possibly a truck, positioned in front of the ego car with its rear lights illuminated. Due to its size and the potential stopping distance required, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle.\n\nAlthough no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers are detected in the image, there is a traffic light visible in the distance, which appears to be green. This indicates that the ego car should be prepared to continue driving through the intersection, provided conditions remain unchanged.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of drops on the windshield suggests rainfall or recent rain. This implies that the windshield wipers are or were recently active, confirming wet road conditions. To navigate safely, the ego car needs to consider these wet conditions in its driving strategy."

Stay alert to the traffic light, being prepared to stop if it changes, but continue if it remains green."
