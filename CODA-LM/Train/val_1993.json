        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is one large green heavy vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck, located ahead of the ego car in the same lane. Due to its size and potential slower speed, the autonomous vehicle needs to be prepared for the truck's slower acceleration and possible stops or slowdowns that might occur.\n\nAdditionally, there are several cars in both the right and left lanes, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of these vehicles requires the ego vehicle to be cautious when considering lane changes, whether it is to overtake the heavy vehicle ahead or to adjust its speed relative to the other cars.\n\nA directional sign board is visible on the right side of the road, which provides an indication of an upcoming exit for FuShi Road. The autonomous vehicle must be cognizant of the exit to anticipate any necessary maneuvers and to be prepared for potential changes in the traffic pattern prompted by other vehicles intending to take the exit.\n\nFurthermore, there is a metal guardrail situated between the opposite lanes of traffic, acting as a barrier. This guardrail is imperative in dictating the driving behavior of the ego vehicle by restricting it from crossing over to the opposing traffic side, thereby ensuring maneuvers are confined to the carâ€™s own side of the highway.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in the scene that require consideration in the driving behavior for the ego vehicle."
