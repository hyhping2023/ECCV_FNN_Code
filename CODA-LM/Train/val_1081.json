On the right side of the road, multiple vehicles are parked with their hazard lights on, reducing the available lane space for the ego car and potentially indicating a hazard ahead. Among these parked vehicles are a few bicycles, adding to the complexity of the driving environment and requiring careful maneuvering.\n\nIn the same lane as the ego car ahead, there are several vehicles that appear to be at a standstill or moving slowly due to traffic congestion, dictating that the ego car will likely need to stop or move at a reduced speed.\n\nThe center of the lane directly ahead of the ego car is occupied by a group of cyclists, impacting the car's movement and requiring it to slow down and possibly change lanes to overtake safely. Additionally, a pedestrian is walking on the right edge of the road towards the parked vehicles in the foreground, necessitating the ego car to monitor the pedestrian's movements and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nFurther ahead, there is a traffic light visible where cars are stopped. Although the current light color is indiscernible, it controls the traffic flow, and the ego car needs to prepare to stop depending on the signal.\n\nTraffic cones are placed by the side of the road next to the parked vehicles, indicating a work zone or a roadside incident. These cones suggest the presence of roadworkers or an obstruction, requiring the ego car to proceed with increased caution and at a lower speed.\n\nNext to the parked cars on the right, there is a dustbin, which, while unlikely to move into the road, should still be noted for spatial awareness."
