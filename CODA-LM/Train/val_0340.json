Firstly, there is a blue and white bus stopped in the opposing lane, partially extending into the intersection. This position of the bus can significantly obstruct the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car, and also poses a risk if the bus were to move unexpectedly. Additionally, there are parked cars lined up along the right-hand side of the road, resulting in a reduced lane width for the ego car and potentially hiding pedestrians or other obstacles from view.\n\nMoreover, although no pedestrians are currently observed on the crosswalk, a pedestrian crossing sign is installed on the right side of the road, signaling a designated crossing area. This makes it imperative for the ego car to be cautious, as the area is prone to pedestrian movement.\n\nThese elements collectively dictate that the ego car should maintain a heightened sense of awareness and cautious driving behavior to navigate through the narrow passage and abide by potential pedestrian activity in the vicinity."
