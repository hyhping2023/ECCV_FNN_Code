The vehicles in the scene include a line of vehicles at the intersection on the right side of the road. The lit taillights of these vehicles indicate that they are either stopped or moving slowly. As a result, the ego car will need to wait for the intersection to clear before proceeding.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, a dog is seen crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle, creating an immediate hazard that necessitates the ego car to halt to avoid any potential injury to the animal.\n\nWhile the traffic signs are not present in this image, the traffic lights are displaying a red signal for the direction in which the ego car is traveling, thus mandating a complete stop in compliance with traffic laws.\n\nLastly, although there are neither traffic cones nor barriers in the traffic image, an individual is noted on the sidewalk to the right, beyond the dog. Although not directly on the road, the proximity of this person requires the autonomous ego vehicle to remain alert to any sudden changes, such as the individual stepping into the street unexpectedly."
