Without visible traffic light information, the ego car must rely on the movement of surrounding vehicles to make decisions about progressing.\n\nTraffic cones are present:\n- Red and white traffic cones on the right boundary of the ego car's lane, indicating lane narrowing or closure, suggesting a construction zone or road work which implies a potential merge situation and necessitates reduced speeds.\n\nLastly, the image shows no visible barriers affecting the path of the ego car, indicating no immediate redirection of traffic flow is required.
