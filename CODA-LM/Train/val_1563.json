The vehicles present include a large construction vehicle situated on the right side of the image, partially occupying the lane of the ego car. This substantial vehicle is noted for its potential impact on traffic flow, necessitating cautious navigation and possibly altering the path of the ego vehicle to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a red car located to the left side in the adjacent lane. This car is moving, adhering to the flow of traffic, signaling the presence of other road users that the ego vehicle needs to be mindful of during its journey.\n\nAlso noticeable in the image are orange traffic cones on the right. These cones serve as a warning for roadwork or a lane closure ahead, prompting the necessity for the ego vehicle to consider merging left if required and to advance with increased caution to safely navigate the situation. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car, indicating a relatively focused set of considerations for navigation and safety in this scenario."
