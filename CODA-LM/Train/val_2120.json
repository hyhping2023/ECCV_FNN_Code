This situation is hazardous as the board extends into the traffic lane, which presents a potential collision risk for the ego car.

SUVs like this one are generally larger than sedans which affects their maneuverability and stopping distance. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe following distance, being cautious of the SUVs blind spots, and preparing for potentially slower response times during abrupt traffic changes, especially in wet conditions as seen in the image.",
