        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several vehicles, vulnerable road users, and no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present.\n\nFirstly, there are three types of vehicles observed:\n1. A black sedan directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights illuminated, indicating either a slowdown or a stop. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and prepare to stop or slow down according to the sedan's actions.\n2. A white bus further ahead in the same lane, stopping near the sidewalk potentially to pick up or drop off passengers, as indicated by its brake lights. The ego car should anticipate potential pedestrians crossing the street in front of or behind the bus and be prepared for sudden stops.\n3. Parked vehicles on both sides of the road, which reduce the available width of the driving lane. The ego car should navigate carefully to avoid colliding with these parked vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users:\n1. Pedestrians walking along the sidewalk on both sides of the road, with some close to the curbside. The ego car should monitor the behavior of these pedestrians to anticipate anyone who may unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n2. Individuals on bicycles riding alongside the parked cars, potentially weaving between the cars and the driving lane. The ego car should remain vigilant for cyclists and leave adequate space for them to maneuver safely.\n\nOverall, the ego car needs to be mindful of both the vehicles and the vulnerable road users in this scenario to navigate safely."
