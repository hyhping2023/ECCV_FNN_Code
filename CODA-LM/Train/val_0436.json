There's a silver car directly ahead in the ego car's lane with its brake lights on, indicating it is either slowing down or stopped. This vehicle directly impacts the ego car's immediate action as it must maintain a safe following distance.\n2. Cars are present in the adjacent left lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car, indicated by the blur of their lights. These cars are relevant for potential lane changes or reactions to their movements.\n3. A vehicle is visible on the far right beyond the traffic cones, waiting to merge or cross the intersection. This vehicle could unexpectedly enter the ego car's lane, affecting its path.\n\n**Traffic Signs:**\n1. Directional signs overhead indicate lane directions and exits but are not legible due to the distance and angle. These signs provide route information for the ego car but do not immediately impact driving behavior.\n2. A partially visible sign in the bottom right corner seems to be an information sign, potentially indicating nearby points of interest or lane usage specifics but is not clear enough to affect current driving decisions.\n\n**Traffic Lights:**\n1. A red traffic light to the left indicates that a left turn is not permitted at this moment. The ego car must obey this signal if the intention is to turn left, causing the car to wait until the light changes.\n2. Faintly visible green traffic lights straight ahead suggest the through lanes are clear to proceed. This green light indicates that it is permissible for the ego car to move forward, assuming no sudden changes in traffic flow.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\nOrange traffic cones are positioned along the right edge of the road, creating a barrier between the road and the off-road area. These cones indicate construction or a designated no-driving zone, directing traffic away from the right side and limiting lane width.\n\n**Other Objects:**\nReflections and wet surfaces suggest recent or ongoing rainfall. These weather conditions mean the ego car should remain vigilant for possible reduced visibility and increased braking distances."
