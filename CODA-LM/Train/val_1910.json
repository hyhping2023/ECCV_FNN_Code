This sign is significant as it alerts the ego car that there could be pedestrians crossing the road, thereby cautioning the vehicle to be ready to stop when necessary. Additionally, there is a line of traffic cones with reflective strips that are discernible in the vehicle's headlights, obstructing the right-hand lane. These cones suggest that there is either a lane closure or ongoing road works ahead, prompting the ego vehicle to either merge into the left lane from the right or to remain vigilant for any potential hazards while continuing in the left lane if it is already there. Complementing the indication given by the cones, horizontal white and red striped barriers are situated in the right-hand lane past the series of traffic cones. These barriers reinforce the message that the right-hand lane is closed and must not be entered, ensuring that the driver understands to maintain travel in the available left lane."
