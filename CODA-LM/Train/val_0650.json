The second vehicle is a large red truck centered in the view, facing our vehicle from the opposite side of the intersection. The presence of this truck could obstruct our view of the opposite traffic and pedestrians, requiring extra caution when the traffic light changes.\n\nThere is an electronic road sign above the intersection, displaying what appears to be a timer or information in red LEDs. However, without clear text, it's not actionable. A red traffic light is visible on the right side of the image above the large red truck, indicating that our vehicle must stop. We are required to remain stopped until the light changes to green.\n\nOn the right, there is a yellow and black striped barrier blocking entry to a zone directly in front of our vehicle.

Additionally, the ego car should prepare to make a turn, either left or right, upon the light change, as going straight appears to be blocked by the barrier. The driver should also keep an eye on the white SUV's indicators for an understanding of its intent, and monitor the truck as it may start moving or could block the view of the road once the light changes. Maintaining awareness of the changes in traffic light status and movements of other vehicles is critical for safe driving behavior."
