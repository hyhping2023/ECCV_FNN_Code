These cars are all traveling in the same direction as the ego car and may influence driving behavior since they might change lanes or adjust their speed. Additionally, there are several construction workers wearing high visibility jackets on the right lane. They pose a potential hazard as they occupy a part of the roadway typically used by vehicles. Moreover, a green highway overhead directional sign can be seen. This sign provides information about lanes and directions for the upcoming exits, which could lead to vehicles changing lanes. Furthermore, there are orange traffic cones set up in alignment on the right, indicating a lane closure. The traffic cones direct vehicles to merge left due to lane closure as a result of road work. Finally, there are concrete barriers on the right side of the highway, demarcating the boundary between the highway and the adjacent land, ensuring that vehicles do not leave the roadway. Other categories such as traffic lights and other objects do not contain any items in this image."
