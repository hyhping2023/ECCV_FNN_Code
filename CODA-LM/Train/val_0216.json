The first is a white SUV that is partially blocking the driving lane on the right side of the ego vehicle. This situation may lead to potential traffic flow obstructions or the SUV possibly merging into the ego vehicle's lane, requiring the driver to be cautious and ready to slow down or stop if needed. The second vehicle is a red car ahead and on the left side, moving with the traffic flow. The ego vehicle needs to maintain a safe distance from this car and watch for any sudden movements or stops.\n\nVulnerable road users include multiple pedestrians near the crosswalk on the right side of the road. These pedestrians pose a risk of entering the crosswalk, so the ego vehicle must be prepared to yield and halt if necessary. Additionally, security personnel are present on both sides of the crosswalk, likely directing pedestrians and vehicles. Their presence necessitates heightened vigilance to comply with any potential instructions or signals.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is seen on the right side, which warns the driver to look out for pedestrians crossing the road ahead.\n\nTraffic cones are placed on the right side of the ego vehicle, forming a lane boundary. They serve to channel the traffic, ensuring the ego vehicle stays within the current lane and does not cross the demarcated boundary.\n\nLastly, there is a stationary structure set back from the road on the right side, behind the traffic cones. Even though it is stationary and not directly in the vehicle's path, it is an element of the road environment that must be acknowledged.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or barriers to be described in this particular scene."
