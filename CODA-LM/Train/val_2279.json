This scene requires the ego car to stay alert to the traffic flow and be ready to adjust its speed to maintain safe following distances and ensure smooth traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, a noticeable arrangement of orange traffic cones is observed along the center of the road, acting as a temporary lane divider. These cones signal a lane shift or indicate the presence of a construction zone, necessitating the ego car to navigate carefully within the designated lane to avoid any mishaps with the cones, thus ensuring safe passage through the altered road layout.\n\nFurther observation reveals guardrails positioned on both sides of the road. These barriers play a crucial role in delineating the boundaries of the road, compelling vehicles, including the ego car, to remain within their respective lanes. The guardrails also serve as a preventive measure, helping to prevent vehicles from veering off the road, thus contributing to overall road safety.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, are present in this scenario, nor are there any traffic signs or traffic lights visible in the image. Similarly, no other miscellaneous objects are noted on or near the roadway that could influence driving behavior or require additional caution from the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically made from a bright orange plastic material with a white reflective band to enhance visibility. Traffic cones are used to guide traffic, indicating alterations in usual driving paths or alerting drivers to potential hazards ahead. They often mark construction areas or temporary changes in traffic flow. The placement of this traffic cone on the highway suggests that there might be a roadwork ahead or a lane closure. As a result, the driver should reduce speed and prepare for possible alterations in the driving lane.",
