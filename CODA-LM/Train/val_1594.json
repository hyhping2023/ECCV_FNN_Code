First, a white van is visible on the left side, positioned in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving forward. The presence of this van is significant as it may influence the ego car's behavior; it can slow down, stop, or potentially change lanes, all of which would necessitate the ego vehicle to adjust its speed and lane choice accordingly.\n\nThe second vehicle is a cement mixer truck located ahead in the right lane, also moving forward. The sheer size of the cement mixer truck and its operational nature could impede the normal flow of traffic. The truck may perform unexpected maneuvers or come to a stop, thus affecting the movement and safety of surrounding vehicles, including the ego vehicle. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle equipped with a cement mixer. The vehicle is typically used in transport of mixed concrete to various construction sites. Due to its heavy-load and potentially protruding parts of the mixer, drivers in proximity should maintain a safe distance to prevent any accidents or damages from the mixture spill or extended components. This implies that the ego vehicle should keep a steady and increased following distance, ensuring enough room to maneuver in case the construction vehicle makes sudden stops or changes in movement.",

Additionally, keep a safe distance from the cement mixer truck to the right because of its size and potential to make wide turns or abrupt stops. The ego car should continue monitoring the road conditions, which currently present no adverse issues that would impact driving decisions."
