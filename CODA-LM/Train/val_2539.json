This vehicle has a visible concrete pumping mechanism and poses a potential hazard due to its large size, which may obstruct visibility and its operational state might mean sudden stops or movements. A light-colored van is positioned to the right, in an adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. This van is close and may change lanes or slow down unexpectedly, which requires monitoring. A bus is parallel to the van on the right, with only a portion visible, and may make frequent stops and obscure visibility, necessitating increased caution.\n\nRegarding traffic signals, a traffic light ahead is not clearly visible but appears to be showing a red light. This suggests that the ego car should be preparing to stop or remain stationary if already stopped. No clear traffic signs are visible, so no actions are required regarding traffic signs in the absence of visibility. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects impacting the current driving situation."

Buses are designed to transport multiple passengers along specific routes within a city. In the context of driving behavior, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be cautious of potential stops the bus may make to pick up or drop off passengers, which could influence traffic flow and require the ego car to stop or slow down.",

Additionally, the bus's size and position may obstruct the drivers view of that lane and further ahead, necessitating increased caution and readiness to react to unseen hazards.",
