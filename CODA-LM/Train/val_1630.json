        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene described contains a variety of elements that require careful attention. Firstly, a forklift is noted to be on the right side of the lane, encroaching partially onto the road with its forks facing the direction of the ego car. This situation necessitates caution from the driver as there is a risk of the forklift moving unexpectedly onto the driving lane, presenting a potential obstacle.\n\nAdditionally, a worker is spotted beyond the barriers on the right side, close to the forklift. While the worker is not directly on the road, their proximity to the forklift raises concerns that they might interact with the vehicle, potentially leading to unforeseen movements near the driving lane.\n\nA traffic light displaying a red signal directly ahead of the ego car signifies a mandatory stop. The driver is obliged to halt and can only proceed once the signal changes to green, ensuring adherence to traffic rules.\n\nLastly, temporary construction barriers located on the right side of the road cover part of the rightmost driving lane. These barriers are a clear indication of a potential road construction or obstruction zone. They serve to reduce the usable width of the right lane, necessitating either that the ego car maintains its current lane or changes lanes to navigate around the obstacle safely.\n\nThe absence of traffic signs, traffic cones, and other objects in the image suggests there are no additional immediate concerns or navigational cues affecting the driving behavior outside of the described entities."

In driving scenarios, the presence of such a vehicle can indicate ongoing construction or maintenance work nearby. For the ego car, this implies a need for increased vigilance and possibly a reduction in speed to safely navigate around the vehicle or any potential obstacles or personnel that could be in the vicinity.",

Once the light turns green, the car should proceed cautiously, especially if there are signs of roadwork or if the forklift is still in the vicinity of the driving lane."
