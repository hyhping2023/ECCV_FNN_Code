This heavy vehicle is likely to move slower and has limited visibility, which could lead to potential risks such as sudden stops or unexpected movements. Additionally, there are passenger cars in the lanes adjacent to both sides of the ego car, with a variety of models and colors. These vehicles could potentially change lanes, which the ego car needs to monitor closely, particularly if the traffic flow ahead slows down or comes to a halt.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a traffic sign indicating an upcoming merging lane, and further ahead, an orange construction sign is visible. These signs suggest that there may be a bottleneck and road construction ahead, which could cause traffic to decelerate or stop altogether.\n\nOver the intersection, a traffic light is displaying a green signal, allowing vehicles to continue moving forward. However, the ego car should stay alert for the light potentially changing to yellow or red, which would require a prompt response.\n\nLastly, there are barriers on the left side of the road, which serve to separate the road from the construction site and pedestrian area. These barriers limit the ability to move laterally and create a narrower path for vehicles, necessitating that the ego car keeps a safe distance to avoid any issues."
