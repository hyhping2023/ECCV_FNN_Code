        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene ahead, there are several key elements affecting the driving dynamics of the ego vehicle. First, a yellow-green garbage truck is on the left side, partially in the left lane, and signaling a right turn with its flashing lights. The ego vehicle will need to consider this and may have to slow down or switch lanes to avoid interfering with the garbage truck's maneuver. Additionally, there's a large truck ahead in the right lane with its rear lights on, signifying it's moving with the traffic flow. This requires the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance and be ready for any potential changes in the truck's speed or if it comes to a stop.\n\nOn the pedestrian front, a group is noticed crossing the street on the opposite side, moving in front of the stopped trucks. This necessitates extra caution from the ego car, which may need to stop to give way to pedestrians that could step into its path.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large truck visible in a nighttime setting, characterized by its robust structure and bright lights showing active operation. Trucks like this commonly transport goods and are heavier and larger than typical passenger vehicles. When following or driving near such trucks, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance due to the truck's larger blind spots and the longer distance they require to stop compared to smaller vehicles. The presence of a truck can influence the ego cars speed and maneuvering decisions, particularly on highway settings where lane changes and speed adjustments are frequent.",

Additionally, keeping a safe distance from the large truck ahead is crucial to allow for safe reaction times."
