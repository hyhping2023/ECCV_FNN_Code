Its rear lights suggest it may be slowing down or stopped, which can obscure the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead and directly influence its driving decisions.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, which is a large, heavy-duty vehicle typically used for road work or construction tasks. It is equipped with cautionary markings and sometimes additional signaling devices to alert other road users of its presence and its potentially slow or stationary nature when in operation. The presence of a construction vehicle on the road generally indicates that there might be road work ahead or that the vehicle may perform sudden stops or slow driving. This necessitates increased alertness and reduced speed from the ego car to safely navigate around or behind this vehicle, ensuring a safe distance is maintained to prevent any collisions.",

Adherence to traffic laws and vigilance for any sudden changes in the road situation caused by the vehicle ahead are also required at this time."
