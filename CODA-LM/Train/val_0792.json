However, there is a \"No parking\" sign to the left of the scene, positioned above a directional sign that indicates a left turn. The \"No parking\" sign informs drivers that they are not allowed to stop or park in the designated area, which could influence where the ego vehicle may come to a stop if needed. The directional sign provides guidance to the ego vehicle about the route options ahead, specifically signaling an upcoming left turn.\n\nAdditionally, there are several orange traffic cones arranged in a line extending from the foreground to the midground on the right side of the ego vehicle. These cones serve to demarcate a boundary or guide the ego vehicle along a certain path, which could suggest that there is road work ahead or a temporary change in the traffic pattern that the ego vehicle must adhere to.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
