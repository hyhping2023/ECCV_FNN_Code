These parked cars reduce the available width of the road, which could hide pedestrians or other road users attempting to enter the driving path. Additionally, further down the lane, a motorcyclist shares the road with the ego car, presenting as a road user who requires extra caution from the ego car to accommodate any rapid changes in speed or direction.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a person dressed in a red uniform, potentially a worker. Although they are not on the road, their close proximity to the curb suggests the driver should be watchful in case the individual steps into the street.\n\nTraffic signs are signaling a green light for the ego car's direction, signifying that it is permissible and safe to continue. However, vigilance is advised to react to any potential changes in the light or the behavior of other road users at the intersection. Corresponding to this, the overhead traffic lights also display a green signal for the ego car, granting the right of way to proceed. Despite this, a cautious approach is recommended, being mindful of any road users that may disregard the red light or be present within the intersection.\n\nThe scene includes plastic barriers strategically positioned to demarcate the boundary between the vehicular roadway and pedestrian areas along the right side of the road. These barriers serve to discourage pedestrians from unpredictably stepping onto the road in this particular area, promoting safer separation between pedestrians and vehicular traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or additional objects reported in this scene that could influence driving behavior."
