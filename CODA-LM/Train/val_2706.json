This car requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and to be prepared for any sudden braking or lane changes from the sedan.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**: A green directional sign indicates the route numbers G45 and G60N. This sign provides route guidance but does not immediately impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**: A series of orange traffic cones are lining the shoulder of the road, signaling a potential work zone or lane closure area. The ego vehicle should exercise caution and be prepared for possible lane shifts or obstructions due to these cones.\n\n4. **Barriers**: Concrete barriers or guardrails are positioned on the sides of the road. These barriers separate the travel lanes from the shoulder or adjacent areas, serving as a physical safety barrier. The ego vehicle should stay within the designated travel lanes.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects contain no relevant elements in this traffic scene and are therefore ignored."
