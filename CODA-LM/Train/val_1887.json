It's crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to prepare for any sudden changes in this vehicle's speed or direction.\n\nOn the opposite side of the median, various cars are traveling in the opposite direction. Though some are hidden by the white car in front, it's important to acknowledge their presence for overall situational awareness.\n\nThere are also cars parked on the right side of the road. While they don't interfere with active traffic flow, they require attention because of the potential for unpredictable movements, such as pedestrians stepping out or doors opening.\n\nA motorcyclist is present to the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car and keeping up with traffic. It's essential to stay vigilant and ready for any unexpected lane changes or stops from the motorcyclist.\n\nAdditionally, a small object is noticed on the road directly ahead of the ego car. This object could be hazardous if driven over, meaning the ego car might need to adjust its trajectory to safely navigate around it.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the scene that the ego car needs to consider in its current driving decisions."
