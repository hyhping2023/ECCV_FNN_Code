Described as heavy and operational, indicated by its safety lights and reflective signs, it also has the license plate 'AFZ561'. This truck is a significant consideration for the ego car because it dictates the car's speed and lane position due to the truck's potential for abrupt maneuvers, like stops or turns.\n\nAdditionally, there is a set of traffic signals ahead, presenting multiple red lights across the lanes. This situation mandates that the ego car, along with all other traffic in its direction, must come to a complete stop. Compliance with these traffic lights is crucial for abiding by road safety regulations and maintaining safety for all road users."

It is characterized by a large cylindrical mixing drum that rotates to keep cement mix consistent during transportation. For the ego car's driving behavior, caution should be exercised while driving close to this vehicle, as its size and the nature of its load could pose safety risks. Sudden stops or spills from the mixer could create hazardous conditions on the road, thus maintaining a safe following distance and being alert to any unpredictable movements is advised.",
