This parked car is a potential hazard as it reduces the available lane width for the ego car and could move unexpectedly, requiring vigilance for sudden movements. Additionally, there is a white SUV parked on the right side of the road, facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle must be cautious with this car as it may enter the roadway, presenting a possible risk.\n\nThere is also a vulnerable road user in the image, a cyclist riding in the same direction as the ego car, situated on the right-hand side of the road. The presence of the cyclist necessitates that the ego car overtakes with care, maintaining adequate distance to ensure the cyclist's safety.\n\nOther objects in the image include a row of parked bicycles on the left side of the road. Although they are stationary and not an immediate threat, they suggest that there might be more cyclists or pedestrians close by who may step onto the roadway, indicating a need for the ego vehicle to remain alert to such possibilities.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image that affects the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
