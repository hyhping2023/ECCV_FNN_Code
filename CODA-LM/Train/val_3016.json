First, a white van is seen in the left lane moving in the same direction as the ego car. This van has an impact by occupying the left lane, which may influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes and overtaking maneuvers. Additionally, a small white car is observed in the rightmost lane, further ahead and also moving in the same direction. This car affects the ego car by setting the pace of the traffic flow in the right lane, potentially influencing the ego car's speed adjustments and lane-switching decisions. No vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this image."

Buses can influence driving behavior as they often make frequent stops, which can cause traffic flow to slow down. Drivers behind and adjacent to the bus should be cautious and may need to change lanes or reduce speed to accommodate the bus as it stops or when passengers are boarding or alighting.",

Due to the presence of debris in the rightmost lane, it is recommended to cautiously change lanes to the left if safe, or slow down to safely navigate around the debris. Continuous monitoring of surrounding traffic is essential to safely react to these road conditions."
