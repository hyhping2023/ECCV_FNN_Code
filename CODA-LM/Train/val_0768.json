This truck is partially obstructing the road, reducing the available driving space and potentially influencing the driving path of the ego car. Ahead in the same lane, several vehicles are moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles are dynamic obstacles, and the ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to adjust its speed.\n\nOn the right side of the truck, two workers are present, one closer to the side of the road and the other further away, behind safety cones. The proximity of the workers to the traffic flow may cause the ego car to slow down and proceed with caution to ensure their safety. Additionally, a blue circular traffic sign with a white arrow and cyclist symbol indicates a bike lane or path to the right of the road, alerting the ego car to the possibility of encountering cyclists.\n\nSafety cones are placed between the truck and the ego vehicle's lane, marking the work area. These cones are a signal for the ego car to avoid the area where roadwork is occurring. Lastly, debris is scattered around the truck and the workers, which might be from the work site. This debris could be hazardous if it were to enter the roadway, so the ego car must remain vigilant to avoid any potential dangers."
