One vehicle, a large truck, is notably positioned on the right side of the ego car, with its rear lights visible implying close proximity. The size and presence of this truck will influence the ego carâ€™s lane choice and will necessitate maintaining a safe distance to ensure safe driving conditions. Additionally, there are traffic lights visible ahead which are currently red. This requires the ego car to stop at the intersection and wait for the lights to change to green before it can proceed safely."
