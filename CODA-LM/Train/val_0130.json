The presence and behavior of the truck will determine whether the ego car can maintain its speed and follow at a safe distance, or if it needs to consider changing lanes.\n2.

These parked cars reduce the available width of the lane and may obscure pedestrians or other vehicles that might pull out.\n\nVulnerable road users observed include:\n1. A cyclist ahead on the right side of the ego car's lane, moving in the same direction. The ego car must be cautious and may need to change lanes to pass safely while giving enough clearance.\n2. Pedestrians on the sidewalk on both sides who could potentially step onto the street. Their movements could be unpredictable, requiring the ego car to be prepared to stop suddenly if someone enters the road.\n\nThere is a green traffic light ahead over the intersection. This indicates that the ego car can proceed, but it must still be attentive to the intersection's dynamics and be ready for light changes.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the road ahead, indicating a lane closure or road works on the right side. The ego car may need to adjust its position within the lane or change lanes if the current lane becomes obstructed.\n\nA yellow physical barrier is separating the bike lane from the car lane on the left side. This indicates division between cyclist and vehicular traffic, limiting the ego car's ability to move to the left.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian working or monitoring near the parked bicycles on the left sidewalk, presenting potential for unexpected movement into the vehicle's pathway."

The vehicle should be ready to respond to the green traffic light possibly changing and any other road users' movements. Caution and readiness to adapt to the changing environment are highly advised."
