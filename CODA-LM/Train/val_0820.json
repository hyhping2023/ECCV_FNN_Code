The presence of the truck could influence the autonomous system's driving behavior, as the truck may slow down or change lanes, necessitating the ego car to adjust its own speed or change lanes to keep a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a road sign indicating a speed limit of 30 km/h on the right side of the road. The autonomous driving system must recognize this sign and ensure the ego car does not exceed the specified speed limit.\n\nMoreover, a series of orange traffic cones are placed in a line on the right-hand side of the road. These demarcate a stretch of road undergoing work or a closed area on the shoulder. This could signal the need for the ego car to exercise caution, possibly requiring a lane change if the driving lane is reduced in width or if there are workers present.\n\nThere are also green cylindrical road barriers arranged consecutively along the right side, delineating the space between the road and the sidewalk and worksite. These barriers serve as a guideline for the autonomous car to maintain a safe distance from areas not intended for driving.\n\nThe summary excludes mention of vulnerable road users, traffic lights, and other objects as the JSON data indicates there are none present in this traffic image."
