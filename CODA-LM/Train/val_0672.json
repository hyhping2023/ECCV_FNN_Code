While they do not directly affect the ego car's immediate driving behavior, it is important to monitor them for any unexpected maneuvers, such as crossing over to the ego car's lane.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a pedestrian crossing sign, alerting the ego car to the possibility of pedestrians crossing the road and the need to be ready to slow down or stop if necessary.\n\nThe traffic lights are currently green for the direction in which the ego car is traveling, allowing the car to proceed. However, the ego car must remain vigilant for traffic conditions and any changes in the traffic light.\n\nThere are traffic cones placed in the left adjacent lane, signaling potential road work or a lane closure. The ego car should stay in its current lane unless it's necessary to change lanes due to a blockage.\n\nLastly, yellow and black barriers are present in the center median, which serve to separate the opposing lanes of traffic and ensure that the ego car stays in the correct lane."
