A red truck parked on the right side of the street facing away from the ego vehicle. While the parked truck is not an immediate hazard, the driving path should be adjusted to maintain a safe distance.\n3. A white car parked on the right side of the road in the distance, also facing away from the ego vehicle. Similar to the red truck, it is not a direct threat but requires monitoring in case it starts moving.\n4. Multiple vehicles parked on the right side of the road ahead past the white car, facing away from the ego vehicle. The presence of these parked vehicles may narrow the drivable path and requires caution.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there is a cat crossing the road from the right to the left in front of the ego vehicle. This cat is an immediate road user that could potentially stop or slow down suddenly, presenting a risk of collision. \n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are observed in the image."
