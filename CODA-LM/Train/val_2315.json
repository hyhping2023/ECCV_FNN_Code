        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several key elements to note:\n\nThere is a white sedan on the left with its tail lights on, suggesting it's moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The proximity and behavior of this sedan are likely to affect the speed and lane selection of the ego car as it progresses.\n\nAhead of the ego vehicle, there are multiple vehicles with their tail lights visible, indicating that the road is busy with traffic all heading in the same direction. The ego car must therefore be mindful of the traffic flow and maintain a safe following distance from these vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cyclist positioned ahead on the right side of the road, near a parked forklift. The presence of the cyclist means the ego car must be prepared to slow down or potentially change lanes to avoid them, thereby requiring the driver to exercise increased vigilance.\n\nOn the right side of the road, we have a barrier that separates the sidewalk from the driving lane, clearly demarcating the area that is off-limits for the ego vehicle to ensure the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nLastly, an obstruction is presented by a parked forklift, which is slightly encroaching onto the road from the right. This obstacle will compel the ego car to make a slight lateral adjustment to the left when passing to prevent any contact with the forklift.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones observed in this scenario."
