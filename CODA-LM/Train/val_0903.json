However, there is an object of interest on the side of the road. Specifically, there is a black animal, which appears to be a dog, located on the right side of the road near the curb. The presence of this animal is significant as it poses a potential hazard. The concern is that the animal might unexpectedly enter the roadway, which could lead to dangerous situations for both the animal and nearby vehicles. It is important for the autonomous driving system to monitor such hazards and be prepared to react accordingly to ensure safety."
