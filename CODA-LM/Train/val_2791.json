        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a large yellow crane truck which is notably occupying the right lane while also partially obstructing the left lane, and it is moving in the same direction as the ego car. This crane truck's considerable size and its positioning could significantly interfere with the ego car's capacity to either pass or safely change lanes. Moreover, the crane arm's dynamic movement introduces an unpredictable element that could pose a hazard on the road. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large, yellow construction vehicle, which appears to be a type of crane mounted on a truck chassis. This vehicle is typically used in construction and heavy lifting tasks. Its presence on the road can influence the driving behavior of nearby vehicles, including the ego car. The ego car may need to reduce speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle, especially considering its size and the potential for sudden stops or turns.",

Overtaking should be done with caution, only if the adjacent lane is clear and sufficient space is available to pass the truck safely. The movement of the crane arm should be monitored closely to anticipate any sudden movements."
