This is a vulnerable scenario that necessitates extra caution from the ego car. Therefore, the ego car must slow down and be prepared to yield or stop to guarantee the pedestrian's and child's safety.\n\nFurthermore, several traffic cones have been placed on the road, indicating a temporary obstruction or construction zone.
