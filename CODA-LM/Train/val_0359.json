        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, various road users and objects are present, including vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects.\n\nThere is a single red car visible ahead in the right lane, moving away from the perspective of the autonomous vehicle, or ego vehicle. This car indicates that the flow of traffic is ongoing and headed in the same direction. Therefore, the ego vehicle should proceed while maintaining a safe following distance from the red car.\n\nA cyclist can be seen on the far right, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of the cyclist suggests the need for the ego vehicle to exercise caution, ensuring adequate space is provided when passing and staying alert to any unexpected maneuvers the cyclist may make.\n\nAt the intersection, a traffic light displaying a green signal is observed straight ahead. This green light denotes that the ego vehicle has permission to proceed straight along its path.\n\nTo the left of the ego vehicle, there are two orange traffic cones marking a boundary or a no-go zone. These cones imply there could be construction nearby or a lane closure, and it is advised that the ego vehicle should avoid this part of the road.\n\nAdditionally, a temporary fence barrier is located on the left side of the road, likely signifying a construction zone or a section that is cordoned off. It is important for the ego vehicle to be mindful of this barrier to steer clear of any ongoing construction activity or debris that might exist on the road surface.\n\nFurthermore, a guard rail is positioned between the traffic cones and the temporary fence barrier. This feature emphasizes the separation between the drivable roadway and an area that is off-limits, reinforcing that vehicles should not venture into this restricted zone.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any traffic signs, hence this category is not discussed in the summary."
