This SUV is distinguishable by its red tail lights, which are illuminated, indicating that it is currently stopped, likely due to a traffic signal. As a result, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop.\n\nAdditionally, a green traffic light is visible ahead to the right, allowing vehicles in that lane to proceed. This indicates that the ego car should be aware of moving vehicles in the adjacent lane, especially if a lane change becomes necessary. On the left side, a red traffic light is visible, signaling that traffic in the ego car's lane must stop, thereby requiring the ego car to remain stationary until the light changes to green.\n\nReflective traffic cones are situated on the right side of the lane, marking the boundary of the drivable area within the ego car's lane. These cones likely indicate construction or road work ahead, necessitating that the ego car should stay within its designated lane boundaries."

For the ego car, which is the vehicle the image is taken from, the presence of this bollard indicates that it should remain within the correct lane and avoid any maneuvers that may cause it to encroach upon the restricted area adjacent to the bollard.",

Additionally, the ego car should continue to keep an eye out for any pedestrians that might enter the crosswalk and maintain a lookout for any indications of road work associated with the traffic cones."
