Additionally, a cement transporting truck is parked on the right side of the road, potentially influencing the driving path if its parking extends into the driving lane.\n\nTraffic signs in the image include a warning sign on an overhead board indicating an upcoming right curve, which necessitates the ego car to reduce speed and exercise caution. Below this, a '30' speed limit sign indicates the need to adjust speed. Two 'No Parking' signs are also seen, one on an overhead board and another on a pole by the roadside, indicating no parking is permitted in this area.\n\nA metal barrier fence is noted along the right side of the road, delineating the sidewalk from the road and signaling that the ego car should not drive over or beyond this barrier."
