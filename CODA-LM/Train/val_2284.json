        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of road users and objects of interest. Firstly, there is a white van positioned in the same lane ahead of the autonomous vehicle. It appears to be moving at a constant speed. In response to this, the autonomous vehicle should maintain a safe distance behind the van, staying observant for any sudden changes in the van's speed or direction that may require adjustments in driving behavior.\n\nAdditionally, on the road's right shoulder, there is a dark, stationary vehicle. The presence of this vehicle could reflect a breakdown or some sort of emergency. As a result, the autonomous car should remain vigilant for potential hazards like unexpected pedestrian movement or the possibility of the vehicle returning to the lane of traffic.\n\nFurthermore, to the right side and off the main road, there is active crane operation. The crane's arm extends partially over the right lane. This poses a potential risk, and the autonomous vehicle will need to be ready to switch lanes if necessary to dodge any unforeseen obstacles or debris that might fall from the crane's activity.\n\nThere were no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a crane, located off to the right side of the highway. The presence of this crane indicates ongoing construction work nearby. For the ego vehicle, this suggests the need for increased vigilance while driving. Possible unexpected activities or temporary traffic patterns associated with the construction site may affect driving conditions. It's important for the ego car to observe any signage that might indicate speed limits, detours, or specific instructions like merging lanes. Additionally, the proximity of the construction site to the roadway could lead to obstacles or personnel near or on the road, necessitating a slower speed and more cautious driving.",

It's crucial to continuously monitor the crane's activities as the ego car approaches and to drive cautiously given the apparent reduced visibility conditions (mist or fog). Also, since there are no visible traffic lights or signs, adhere to the general rules of the road."
