This situation requires the ego car to be cautious due to the shared use of the road space and the potential for sudden movements by the cyclist, such as avoiding obstacles or making turns, which could affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAlthough there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones visible in the current scene that directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car, there is a notable presence of a barrier. This barrier, in the form of a wall on the right side of the road, limits the available road space for both the cyclist and the ego car. It necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the cyclist, especially since overtaking may become risky if the road narrows due to the barrier.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes parked bicycles, scooters, and miscellaneous objects on the side of the street. These items could lead to unexpected pedestrian movements onto the roadway, suggesting potential pedestrian activity. Therefore, the ego car should remain vigilant and prepared for any sudden pedestrian movements, enhancing the need for cautious driving in this environment."
