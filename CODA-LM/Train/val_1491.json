This stationary van may obstruct the right lane and could necessitate a lane change or cause the ego car to slow down. In addition, there are cars moving in the opposite lanes that must be observed to ensure it is safe for the ego car to maneuver around the parked van while also being mindful of oncoming traffic.\n\nMoreover, there is a pedestrian who seems poised to cross the street at the pedestrian crossing sign. This individual is looking toward the road, indicating the possibility that they might step onto the road, which would require the ego car to come to a halt and yield.\n\nFurther caution is advised due to the pedestrian crossing sign located on the right side of the road. This sign signals the presence of a pedestrian crossing up ahead and implies a higher chance of pedestrian activity. Thus, the ego car should remain vigilant and be ready to stop if needed.\n\nComplicating matters is a red traffic light observed to the right, above the parked van. This traffic light dictates that the ego car must stop at the intersection, irrespective of pedestrian movements or other vehicles' actions.\n\nLastly, there are some unspecified objects near the pedestrian walkway on the right side of the road, which appear to be related to the parked van. These items might contribute to potential blockages and distractions close to the pedestrian crossing area. \n\nIn this situation, there are no traffic cones, barriers, or other categories of road users present in the image."
