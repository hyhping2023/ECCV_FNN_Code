This truck, carrying a load, is described as being parked on the right side of the road. The positioning of the truck has a considerable impact on driving behavior, as it occupies part of the lane. This encroachment into the lane necessitates careful navigation by the ego car, potentially requiring a lane change to avoid any safety hazards. The need for heightened caution arises from the reduced space available for maneuvering around the parked truck."

Typically, these vehicles are equipped with specialized machinery and are used in road construction or heavy load carrying. The presence of such a vehicle on the road indicates ongoing or upcoming road work, which may involve lane closures or reduced speed zones. Thus, the ego car should prepare for potential disruptions in normal traffic flow, adhere to any posted speed restrictions, and be vigilant for workers and equipment on or near the roadway.",
