However, there are several red and white striped traffic cones placed on the road. The traffic cones suggest that there may be construction or road work ahead. Drivers will need to exercise extra caution due to these developments, and there might be a requirement to alter lanes or adhere to a diversion route as a result of the ongoing work.\n\nAdditionally, there are tall, black bollards or barriers installed on the road. These barriers are presumably there to create a physical separation between lanes or to prohibit vehicles from accessing certain areas. The presence of these barriers could influence the driving route or lane choice of the ego car, necessitating adjustments in navigation or positioning. There is no mention of other objects in the traffic image."
