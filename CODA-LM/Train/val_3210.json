It is crucial to observe this car to determine if it will enter the traffic flow or if someone will open the doors, which could affect the driving path of the ego vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, there are two dogs on the road ahead of the ego vehicle. Such vulnerable road users are known for their unpredictable nature, which means they could potentially cause an obstruction or lead to an accident if they are not taken into account by the vehicle's driving system.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is visible in the distance with a green signal, indicating that the ego car currently has the right of way. However, given the presence of the dogs on the road, the car must continue to approach the area with caution.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in this scenario, which means these elements do not impact the driving behavior in the present context."
