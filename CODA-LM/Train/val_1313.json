However, the scene includes a cyclist with a large cargo trailer on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane. The presence of the cyclist is significant as they are moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle and the large cargo trailer poses a risk of encroachment into the ego vehicle's lane. Therefore, it is essential for the ego vehicle to monitor the cyclist's movements carefully and be ready to adjust its trajectory if necessary to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a set of traffic lights ahead on the road which are green. The green lights allow the ego vehicle to continue, but caution is advised. The ego vehicle should remain alert and prepared to stop if the lights change to yellow or red upon approaching the intersection."
