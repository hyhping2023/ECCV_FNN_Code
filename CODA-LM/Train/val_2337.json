The presence of this parked vehicle necessitates that the autonomous vehicle monitors for any potential movement from the parked car and adjusts its lane choice and driving speed due to the reduced road width available.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible in the distance ahead that is showing a blue light. This is unusual as blue is not a standard color for traffic signals. This could indicate that the light is not for traffic control or that it may require interpretation according to specific regional traffic codes, especially considering the low visibility conditions."

Its presence on the scene influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating cautious maneuvering and awareness of the vehicle's dimensions to avoid any potential collision. The parked or stationary position of the car suggests that the ego car may need to adjust its path or speed to safely navigate around it, especially in a low-light environment where visibility is reduced.",

It should maintain a lower speed to react to potential hazards that may not be clearly visible. The vehicle should also be prepared to stop or maneuver safely if the nature of the blue light ahead is established to be relevant for traffic control or if any unexpected obstacles are detected. Additionally, keeping a safe distance from the parked vehicle on the left to avoid doors opening or pedestrians emerging is advised."
