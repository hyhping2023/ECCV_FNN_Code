        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are three vehicles of interest:\n\n1. There is a white car located on the left side of the ego car, both moving in the same direction. Close attention should be paid to this vehicle although there's no current indication of it changing lanes; its proximity means it could potentially affect the ego car's trajectory.\n\n2. A large red truck is also present, situated ahead of the ego car on the same road. It occupies the entire width of its lane, meaning overtaking is not possible without the ego car changing lanes. Consequently, it's necessary for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any changes in the truck's speed.\n\n3. On the right side of the road is a parked yellow crane truck, which is stationary. While not an active part of the traffic, it poses an obstruction that could impact sightlines and the availability of road space. The ego car must be cautious, ready to adjust speed or direction to safely navigate around any unforeseen issues that may arise from the presence of this large vehicle.\n\nThe traffic scene contains no other notable road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle, notably a mobile crane, typically used for lifting heavy materials at construction sites. The presence of this vehicle in a traffic scenario suggests that there could be ongoing construction or similar operations in the area. Driving near such equipment requires increased caution from the ego car to avoid any potential risks associated with the construction activity, like sudden movements of the crane or the presence of construction workers and debris around the vehicle.",
