        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, several elements influence the ego car's driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there are multiple vehicles present. A black SUV is located on the left side of the ego car in an adjacent lane, slightly ahead and possibly moving parallel, thus requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be alert for any lateral movements. Directly in front of the ego car, a white sedan occupies the same lane and dictates the ego car's speed, necessitating preparedness to adjust speed or change lanes if the sedan slows down or stops. Additionally, a grey SUV is on the right side in an adjacent lane and appears to be moving parallel, which requires monitoring in case it changes lanes or affects the traffic flow.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users present. Directly in front of the ego car, a cyclist is crossing the street and has the right of way, requiring the ego car to yield and wait for them to clear the lane before proceeding. Moreover, pedestrians are visible on a crosswalk to the left of the ego car, signifying potential foot traffic that could enter the roadway, thereby necessitating cautious driving and readiness to stop if they step onto the carriageway.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, multiple round signs are visible. A '30' speed limit sign indicates a reduced speed area, and a no parking sign is observed on the left side of the road. These signs instruct the ego car to adhere to the speed limit and avoid stopping or parking in designated areas.\n\nNo traffic lights are observed at the intersection, which means the ego car must follow right-of-way rules and pay close attention to road signs and other road users for cues on how to proceed.\n\nOrange traffic cones are set up on the left side, funneling traffic into specific lanes and indicating possible road work or a detour ahead. This requires the ego car to stay within designated lanes to avoid construction or obstacles and to reduce speed accordingly.\n\nLastly, there is a police officer in reflective clothing directing traffic in the middle of the intersection. The presence of the officer means the ego car must follow their instructions, which may override standard traffic control devices and signals."

Traffic cones are used to mark out areas that are unsafe or where cars should not drive, such as during road construction work or when an accident has occurred.
