This vehicle may require the ego car to remain alert for any potential abrupt actions such as slowing down, turning, or coming to a full stop. Additionally, height limit signs are present, indicating maximum clearances of 4 meters and 6.5 meters under the scaffolding structure. The ego car must comply with these height restrictions to avoid any damage while passing through. To guide the traffic flow, a sequence of red and white traffic cones has been set up to delineate the left boundary of the lane beneath the construction scaffolding. The cones signal that the area left of them is restricted for vehicular access, urging the ego car to stay to the right-hand side within the marked driving lane. Furthermore, temporary barriers are placed alongside the traffic cones, creating a safety barrier between the roadway and the construction area. These barriers help maintain separation and protect both the construction zone and the vehicles on the road from potential hazards."
