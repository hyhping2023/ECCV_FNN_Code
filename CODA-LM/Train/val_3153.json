It is slightly ahead and moving in parallel to the ego vehicle. The taxi cab's proximity and parallel placement suggest that there is a chance of it changing lanes or merging, which is something the ego car should be ready for.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a solid wall, near which large cable spools and a trash bin are placed close to the edge. These objects constitute potential dangers for the ego car because they take up space on the shoulder, and the cable spools look unstable, raising the concern that they might roll into the driving lane."
