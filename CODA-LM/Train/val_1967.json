However, there is a set of orange traffic cones with reflective bands strategically placed around a section of the road indicating closure. These cones suggest that there is likely construction or road maintenance work being performed and provide guidance for maneuvering around the affected area safely. Additionally, there is a temporary road barrier equipped with reflective strips which serves as a notification that the road ahead is closed. The ego car is required to identify this barrier and seek an alternative path to continue its journey as proceeding forward is not an option. No other objects are reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used in road settings to warn drivers of temporary traffic conditions or to redirect traffic. The bright color and reflective elements make it highly visible, even in low light or poor weather conditions, which is crucial for alerting drivers to changes in the usual traffic patterns or to watch out for potential hazards. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone influences the ego vehicle to possibly slow down and prepare for deviations from normal driving paths, ensuring safety.",
