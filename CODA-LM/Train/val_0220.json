        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several road users and objects noted. First, there is a white cement mixer truck on the left side of the road, moving in the opposite direction of the ego car. Although the truck is large and on the opposite side, it does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions, but it should be noted for general awareness. Additionally, a white sedan is in the center of the image, appearing to be moving away from the ego car in the same direction. The sedan's position and movement do not pose an immediate influence on the driving behavior as it is maintaining its lane and direction.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, a cyclist is noted on the left side of the road, moving parallel to the ego car. The cyclist's presence is important to acknowledge because they may alter their course or position, which would prompt the ego car to maintain distance and monitor the cyclist's actions carefully. Furthermore, there is a pedestrian in the center of the image, crossing the road with a suitcase and looking at her phone, located at the ego car's front right. The pedestrian is a critical road user to consider because her behavior directly impacts the ego car's immediate driving decisions due to the potential risk of stepping into the driving path.\n\nThe scene also includes traffic signs. There is an orange and white striped traffic sign attached to a pole above the center of the road, indicating that vehicles should keep right due to an obstruction. This sign suggests that there may be an obstruction ahead that would require the ego car to alter its driving path to keep right.\n\nLastly, there are orange temporary traffic barriers to the right of the ego car, delineating construction works. These barriers indicate that there may be road works or obstructions that require the ego car to remain in the left lane or prepare to change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that need to be reported in this traffic image."
