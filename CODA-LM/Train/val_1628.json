The ego car needs to maintain a safe distance, monitoring the lead car's speed and brake lights to anticipate any sudden stops or changes in speed.\n\nSecondly, a group of workers in high visibility orange vests are observed standing and walking on the right-side pedestrian walkway, carrying equipment. Their proximity to the roadway requires the ego car to be cautious and ready to react in case someone steps into the lane.\n\nA green traffic light is visible ahead, signaling the ego car to continue moving forward. While the ego car should maintain its current speed, it must remain alert for any signal changes or road condition variations.\n\nOrange traffic cones are positioned along the right edge of the road, indicating a work zone or lane narrowing. The ego vehicle should steer slightly to the left within its lane to maintain a safe distance from the cones and any road work.\n\nA metal fence barrier is present on the right side, separating the pedestrian walkway and the work site from the road. This barrier helps keep road debris or equipment from entering the road but also limits the space for workers, stressing the importance of the ego car maintaining its position away from the barrier.\n\nLastly, there are trees and lamp posts along the right side of the roadway. While these objects do not pose an immediate risk, their presence adds complexity to the road environment and reinforces the need for vigilance to potential unexpected obstacles or road condition changes."
