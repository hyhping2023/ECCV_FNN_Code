        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large industrial vehicle with an articulated mechanical arm directly in front of the ego vehicle, located in the same lane. This industrial vehicle is taking up a considerable part of the lane and might be moving slower than the usual traffic. The ego car will have to either switch lanes or reduce speed to keep a safe distance due to the size of this vehicle and its potential to block the lane.\n\nAdditionally, there are several cars in the neighboring lanes moving in the same direction, including a blue car to the left that is partly in the same lane as the ego car. The ego vehicle must keep an eye on these cars when making lane changes, especially since the close proximity of the blue car can limit the ego car's ability to move into that lane safely.\n\nOn the right-hand side, there is a motorcycle traveling parallel to the ego vehicle. The presence of the motorcycle demands heightened caution from the ego car for any lane changes or speed adjustments. Motorcycles have a smaller profile and are more vulnerable on the road, thus necessitating additional attention from surrounding vehicles.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

Its presence on the road indicates nearby construction activities.

Indicate and check mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes, particularly watching for the blue car on the left and the motorcycle on the right. If lane changing is necessary, it should be done with ample caution and only when safe to do so. Continuous monitoring of the surrounding vehicles is essential to respond to their movements dynamically."
