However, there is a 'No Bicycle' sign on the right side of the road, attached to the fence of a park. This sign is important as it informs cyclists that they are not allowed in the area, which could influence the behavior of cyclists nearby and affect the overall traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange and yellow traffic cones placed on the foreground and left side of the road. These cones are directing vehicles along a specific path, which is likely due to roadwork or a change in the usual traffic pattern. The ego car must be cautious and maintain a safe distance while navigating around these cones.\n\nFurthermore, there is a large blue barrier that is partially blocking the road on the right side, with more barriers set up perpendicular to the road. These barriers suggest that a portion of the road may be closed or under construction. As a result, vehicles will need to avoid this area and may need to find an alternative route.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or other objects reported in the scene."
