        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several road users and traffic controls affecting driving behavior:\n\nFirstly, there's a white car directly ahead on the same lane as the ego car, indicating a left turn with its signal, and it is positioned to suggest that it is preparing for that turn. This implies the car is actively changing direction, and the ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to adjust its speed or direction to accommodate this.\n\nAdditionally, a gray SUV is located on the right side of the ego car, holding a position that suggests it may continue straight or turn right. Since it's in close proximity, the ego vehicle must keep an eye on this SUV to anticipate any potential lane changes and adjust its maneuvering space accordingly.\n\nIn terms of pedestrians, two individuals are observed crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle, within a marked crosswalk. Given that pedestrians have the right of way, the ego car is required to yield and wait for them to complete their crossing safely before proceeding.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene are pertinent as well. One set of lights, positioned in the left turn lane where the white car is preparing to turn, shows a red signal, indicating that traffic intending to turn must come to a halt. This requires the ego car to stop if it is in the turn lane or to proceed with caution if it's in a lane designated for moving straight, provided the signal for that direction allows.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic lights for the straight-ahead lanes also display a red signal, mandating that the ego car must stop regardless of which lane it's in.\n\nFinally, there is an arrangement of red and white traffic cones directing the traffic flow into certain lanes, likely indicating a detour or lane closure. These cones serve as a guide for the ego car, signaling it to follow the new lane demarcations and not to cross into the restricted area delineated by the cones.\n\nThe JSON data does not include any reports of traffic signs, barriers, or other objects in the traffic image."

It's essential to remain stationary until the lights turn green and it is safe to continue."
