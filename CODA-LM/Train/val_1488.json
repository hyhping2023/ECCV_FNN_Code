It is important to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle to react appropriately to any sudden stops or speed changes it may make.\n\nTo the right side of the ego vehicle, there is a cyclist that is also moving in the same direction. The cyclist is noticeable by the reflective jacket and equipped with lights. Due to the cyclist's proximity to the driving lane, it requires the ego vehicle to pay close attention and be ready to adjust speed or change lanes to safely distance itself from the cyclist if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian on the footpath to the left of the ego vehicle. While the pedestrian is not currently on the road and therefore not directly affecting the driving path, there should still be a degree of awareness to ensure safety in the event the pedestrian were to step onto the roadway.\n\nThis summary reflects all non-empty categories from the provided JSON data, with emphasis on the descriptions and explanations of how each road user affects the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in this specific image, according to the JSON data provided."
