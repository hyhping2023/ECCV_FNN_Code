        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scenario presented, the ego vehicle is accompanied by multiple road users and objects that need to be considered. There is an auto-rickshaw on the left side, moving in the same direction, characterized by its protective awning. Due to its proximate position relative to the driving lane, it is a factor to be aware of when the ego car contemplates lane changing or overtaking. Moreover, a truck is spotted approximately 50 meters ahead in the right lane, which is also moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the truck requires attention as it could slow down or shift lanes, thus influencing the ego car's navigation choices.\n\nAdditionally, two pedestrians are observed on the left sidewalk, near the auto-rickshaw. Their proximity to the roadway demands vigilance as they might enter the road, necessitating the ego car to decelerate. \n\nRegarding road signage, there is a blue road sign visible on the right, which is only partly visible. Despite being at a distance, it serves the purpose of providing guidance or warning about forthcoming road conditions.\n\nAt the intersection ahead, a traffic light displaying a green light can be seen. This light permits vehicles, including the ego car, to continue their movement, but it also requires the driver to be ready for potential changes in the light.\n\nLastly, the scene includes concrete barriers on the right side of the driving lane. These barriers delineate the boundary between the road and a construction area, potentially affecting the drivable width of the lane. \n\nThere were no traffic cones or other objects mentioned in the image that might affect driving behavior."
