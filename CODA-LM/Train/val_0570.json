One sign indicates a speed limit of 50 km/h, ensuring that the ego car should not exceed this speed limit. Another sign indicates that trucks over 4.5 meters in height are not allowed, which does not affect the ego car if it is not of the restricted vehicle type but requires vigilance for any large vehicles that may have missed this sign.\n\nThere is a red traffic light above the tunnel entrance, necessitating that the ego car comes to a stop and waits for the light to change to green before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, two orange traffic cones are positioned on the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, suggesting a potential hazard or road work ahead, prompting the ego car to steer slightly to the right to maintain a safe distance from the cones."
