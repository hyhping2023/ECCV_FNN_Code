Firstly, there is a yellow construction vehicle directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. This vehicle is positioned partially on the road and partially on the side, facing the same direction as the ego car. It represents a potential obstacle since it is uncertain whether the vehicle is stationary or moving slowly, necessitating the ego car to be ready to slow down or change lanes to avoid it.\n\nSecondly, a white covered truck is traveling in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car and in the same direction. Although this truck is in a different lane, its presence is important to consider, especially if it decides to merge into the ego car's lane or if the ego car needs to change lanes to avoid the previously mentioned construction vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, evident by its features such as robust build, the presence of heavy-duty tires and construction machinery attachments. Usually, construction vehicles on the road signify ongoing road work nearby, which may cause delays or require drivers to slow down and follow temporary traffic directions. In the driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle often implies the need for extra caution to accommodate potential obstacles or altered traffic patterns that could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car.",
