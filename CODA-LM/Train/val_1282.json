The first is a black sedan directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights on, indicating that it has either slowed down or come to a complete stop. This suggests that there may be congestion ahead or some form of obstruction, and as a result, the ego car should be ready to stop or slow down accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large truck on the left side of the ego car, slightly ahead. It appears to be carrying a heavy industrial item and is partially obstructing the ego car's lane. The presence of the truck may cause visibility issues for the ego car, and it will be necessary to reduce speed to ensure safety. The ego car should also be prepared for potential evasive maneuvers due to the truck's position and size.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
