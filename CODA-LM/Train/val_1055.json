Directly ahead in the same lane is a single sedan with its taillights on, indicating that it is either in motion or stopped and is positioned in the center of the lane. This vehicle could potentially slow down, stop suddenly, or change lanes, necessitating careful monitoring and possible reactions from the ego car.\n\nOn the right side of the lane, multiple traffic cones line the edge, creating a narrow path. These cones suggest a possible road hazard or construction zone ahead, requiring the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution. Additionally, there is a temporary barrier on the right side, likely supporting the traffic cones. This barrier reinforces the indication to stay within the coned area as it is unsafe to drive outside of it, prompting the ego car to remain in its current lane."

Traffic cones are usually orange colored with a reflective strip to be visually prominent even at night. In the scenario presented, the cones indicate that there are construction or maintenance activities ahead or lane restrictions. This placement affects driving behavior by signaling to the driver to slow down, be cautious, and possibly merge into another lane to safely navigate past the indicated zone.",
