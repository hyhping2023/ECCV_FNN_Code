However, there are vulnerable road users present, specifically pedestrians walking along the sidewalk parallel to the ego vehicle's travel direction on the right side. These pedestrians are considered within potentially hazardous proximity to the road, raising concerns that they could unexpectedly enter the roadway, which requires close monitoring by the ego vehicle for any sudden changes in pedestrian behavior.\n\nAdditionally, an obstruction is present in the form of a collapsed barrier and construction materials that have spilled onto the roadway on the right side ahead of the ego vehicle. This situation necessitates a change in the path of the ego vehicle to safely navigate around the debris and avoid a collision, indicating a significant impact on the driving behavior and necessitating cautious and calculated maneuvers to ensure safety."
