Although the truck appears stationary and is not on the immediate path of the ego car, its presence suggests that there may be construction or work activity nearby which could affect traffic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic signs present. A blue directional sign with a white arrow is located on the right side of the road, indicating a detour or a change in traffic patterns. This sign directs traffic to alter their route, which may require the ego car to change lanes or follow a new route. Next to the blue directional sign, there is a yellow sign with black symbols and text on a stand, likely providing additional details about the detour or road conditions. This sign may convey important information regarding the detour, such as distance or the reason for the detour.\n\nIn front of the directional signs, there are two traffic cones with reflective stripes on the right side of the road. These cones are placed to draw attention to the detour signs and to potentially indicate the start of a cordoned-off area or lane changes due to construction or roadwork.\n\nFurthermore, there is a barrier with alternating yellow and black patterns on the right side of the road, close to the sidewalk edge. This barrier serves to separate the road from the sidewalk or mark the boundary of a safe area, guiding the ego car to stay within the traffic lane and be alert for possible obstructions or changes in lane width.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image."
