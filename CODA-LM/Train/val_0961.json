The ego car must maintain a safe distance from the parked car to avoid any issues that might arise if a door were to open suddenly or if pedestrians were to step out from behind the vehicle. Secondly, there is a red forklift positioned diagonally to the left in the foreground, which may be entering or already occupying the road. The forklift's presence could potentially obstruct the ego car's path or necessitate sudden maneuvering to avoid a collision.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect driving behavior.\n\nRegarding traffic signs and traffic lights, the image does not show any that would influence immediate driving decisions. The absence of visible traffic signs suggests that standard road rules should be followed, while the lack of traffic lights means the ego car should proceed based on right-of-way rules and other typical traffic regulations."

Furthermore, the ego vehicle should be ready to comply with any road rules that may not be immediately visible in the image."
