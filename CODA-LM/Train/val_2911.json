        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, there is a large yellow construction truck or vehicle with flashing warning lights parked on the right side of the road. This construction vehicle occupies part of the lane, reducing the available space for the ego vehicle to travel. Its presence and warning lights indicate ongoing roadwork or construction in the area, necessitating caution and possibly a reduction in speed.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan car is visible ahead on the road. The presence of this vehicle ahead means that the ego vehicle needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to potentially slow down or change lanes to ensure safety and comply with traffic regulations.\n\nFurthermore, a line of orange traffic cones is present, separating the right lane from the construction vehicle. These cones serve as a warning to the ego vehicle to avoid that area and potentially merge into the left lane if space is available, ensuring the safety of the construction workers and the smooth flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data that impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle in this specific scenario."
