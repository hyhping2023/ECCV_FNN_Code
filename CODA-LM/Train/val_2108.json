Ahead of the ego car, there are several cars also moving in the same direction, and the distance to these cars will determine the ego car's speed and the possibility of overtaking.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian wearing a white top is seen crossing the road from left to right, accompanied by a small dog. This requires the ego car to slow down or stop to ensure the safety of the pedestrian and the dog.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a speed limit sign indicating a maximum speed of 40 km/h, which means the ego car must not exceed this speed. Next to the speed limit sign, there is a no stopping or parking sign, alerting the ego car that stopping or parking is not allowed along this section of the road.\n\nFurthermore, there are barriers on the right side of the ego car, separating the road from the sidewalk. These barriers prevent the ego car from making any maneuvers to the right side. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned in the data that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
