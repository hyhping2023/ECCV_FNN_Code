        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, two notable types of road users categorized as vehicles are present. Firstly, there is an oncoming vehicle with its bright headlights turned on, facing the direction of the ego car, though the distance to it is not specified. The glare from these headlights could impair visibility and the driver's ability to react promptly, which calls for extra caution while driving. Secondly, multiple vehicles are parked alongside the road on the right-hand side, some with their taillights illuminated. This indicates that these parked vehicles might be occupied and could potentially move unexpectedly or block part of the traffic lane. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe distance when passing these parked vehicles to mitigate any risk of collision. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not have any details listed, suggesting their absence from the scene."

Additionally, the driver should stay alert to any other road users that may be difficult to spot due to the low light conditions."
