Though the cyclist currently does not immediately affect the ego car's driving behavior, it is important to maintain awareness in case the cyclist changes direction or position.\n\nThere are multiple traffic signs present: a 'No Parking' sign is visible on the right, a 'Right Turn Only' arrow sign, and a red-and-white striped warning sign indicating no entry from the opposite lane next to the intersection. The 'No Parking' sign provides information without affecting driving behavior, while the 'Right Turn Only' sign and the prohibition sign dictate the permissible directions for the ego car, making decision-making for the upcoming intersection clearer.\n\nTraffic cones are situated to the right of the ego car, partially obstructing one of the lanes. These cones indicate possible roadwork or a closed lane, suggesting that the ego car should either stay in the current lane or prepare to change lanes if necessary."
