The proximity and size of the truck could obstruct the ego car's view of the road ahead, necessitating the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, various vehicles can be seen stationary in a queue on the left, indicating congested traffic or a stoppage, which suggests the potential for sudden stops, requiring the ego car to be cautious and keep a safe distance from other vehicles."

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the cement mixer truck to account for the limited visibility and potential for abrupt halts. Due to the congested traffic observed, the ego car should drive at a reduced speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. Vigilance is key in this scenario as the traffic situation is dynamic, and unexpected events could occur due to the proximity of other vehicles and the likely stop-and-go flow of traffic."
