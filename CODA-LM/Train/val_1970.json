This vehicle could potentially cross the path of the ego car or make a turn, necessitating close monitoring of its movements to adjust the driving strategy of the ego car accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is spotted traveling from left to right across the intersection, positioned slightly to the right side in the distance. The presence of the cyclist could impact the traffic flow, and it's important for the ego car to be prepared to yield if necessary, to ensure safety for all.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a blue roundabout sign is placed on the right side, signaling that there's a roundabout ahead. This informs the ego car to be ready to give way to traffic already on the roundabout and to navigate the upcoming roundabout with proper caution and adherence to traffic rules.\n\nAn anomalous element observed in the scene is a booth with a person inside located on the left side of the image. While the booth itself does not direct influence traffic movements, it demands vigilance from the ego car. This caution is necessary in the event pedestrians decide to exit or enter the booth, potentially crossing the road unexpectedly.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers shown in the image; thus these categories do not impact the current traffic situation or the driving behavior of the ego car in this scenario."
