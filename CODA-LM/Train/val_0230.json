To the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, there’s a white car that should be observed for potential lane changes or turns that could impact the ego vehicle's trajectory. Further to the left, a red bus is traveling in its dedicated lane, and it should be taken into account by the ego car especially if it makes any stops or merges that could alter the traffic flow.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right of the ego vehicle, there are pedestrians that the ego vehicle must be ready to yield to should they enter the roadway. Additionally, a person is seen near a parked taxi on the right who may step onto the street or hail a taxi; the ego car must be vigilant and may need to stop unexpectedly.\n\nThere is a blue right turn arrow sign on the left side of the road above the lane indicating that the lane is for right turns only, which informs the ego car to stay in its current lane. A no parking sign on the right side of the road indicates that stopping or parking is not allowed, although this does not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\nA series of traffic cones are placed to the left of the ego car, marking the driving lane boundary and signaling that the ego car should remain in its lane to avoid adjacent works or hazards. There is also a black barrier with yellow reflective stripes in front of the ego vehicle which marks a no-entry area, perhaps for pedestrian use, and helps ensure that the ego car maintains its current lane.\n\nThere are no indications of the presence of traffic lights or other objects in the given data for the traffic image."
