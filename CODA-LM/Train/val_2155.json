        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key road users and objects present which influence driving behavior.\n\nVehicles:\n\n1. A white van is located near the right edge of the image, positioned diagonally, and is facing towards the left-hand side. This van could either be getting ready to move or may be parked. Its position on the road can impact the navigable path of the autonomous vehicle, thus requiring extra caution in case the van begins to move into traffic.\n\n2. A silver car is placed in the center-right of the image, angled across what seems to be parking spaces, and facing left as well. This car's behavior is uncertain; if it intends to pull into the roadway, it could affect the autonomous vehicle's chosen path. The vehicle must be prepared for sudden evasive action should this occur.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n\nThere is a cyclist near the edge of the roadway on the right side, partially hidden behind the white van, and appears to be stationary. The close proximity of the cyclist to the vehicular travel lane poses a risk, and their potential movement onto the road or crossing areas must be monitored cautiously to prevent any potential collisions.\n\nOther Objects:\n\nOn the far left of the scene, there is a prominent green sign with red and white text, which appears to be commercial in nature. While it is large and vertically aligned, this sign does not influence traffic movement or the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions, as it is not intended for traffic guidance.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
