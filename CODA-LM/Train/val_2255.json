First, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road, which is facing the opposite direction to the ego car's travel lane. This parked car reduces the available width of the road, making it necessary for the ego car to be vigilant to avoid a conflict when overtaking. Additionally, further down the road, there are several cars parked intermittently on the right side with their headlights on, facing towards the ego car. These parked cars might compromise visibility, so the ego-car must remain cautious of potential hazards, such as passengers opening car doors or pedestrians appearing suddenly from between the parked vehicles. No other categories of road users or objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the image."

The headlights are off, indicating the vehicle is parked. This vehicle's position influences the driving behavior of the ego car by narrowing the usable roadway width, requiring potentially careful maneuvering or reduction in driving speed to safely pass, especially if other oncoming vehicles are present.",

There is no immediate need to make an evasive maneuver, but preparedness for unexpected obstacles is crucial in such low-light conditions."
