The truck poses a potential hazard as it partially obstructs the lane, and the presence of workers increases the risk. Additionally, a cyclist is sharing the lane with the ego vehicle, requiring the ego car to maintain extra distance and be cautious due to the cyclist's vulnerability.\n\nThere are several traffic signs on the right side, including directional and informational signs indicating a straight path for a specific type of vehicle and a warning sign for roadworks ahead. The ego vehicle needs to be aware of potential changes or obstacles due to the roadwork indicated by the sign.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in this scene, so they are not relevant for immediate decision-making. Orange traffic cones are placed around the maintenance truck on the right side, indicating a work zone and necessitating that the ego car navigate around them, which reduces the lane width.\n\nMetal barriers separate the sidewalk from the road on the right side, ensuring that pedestrians stay on the sidewalk and reducing the risk of pedestrian-related incidents for the ego vehicle. Finally, there are no other relevant objects affecting the driving behavior in this scene."
