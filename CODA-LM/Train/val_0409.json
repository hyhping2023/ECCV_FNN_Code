Maintaining a safe following distance is key due to the importance of the lead vehicle's speed and distance for the ego car's speed regulation. Additionally, several cars are observed in the left lane, moving in the same direction, with some cars' headlights on, which suggests low visibility or nighttime conditions. The behavior of these vehicles is relevant for any lane-changing decisions, as it may call for extra vigilance for merges or adjustments in speed.\n\nAlso present are illuminated overhead gantry signs that appear to provide traffic information or navigation assistance. Currently, these signs are too far to affect immediate driving choices but will become highly relevant for route planning as the ego vehicle approaches.\n\nA traffic light ahead is displaying a green signal, allowing the ego vehicle to continue on its path while staying alert for any changes in the light signal.\n\nOn the roadside, orange traffic cones are noticed on the side of the rightmost lane, hinting at possible road work or a lane closure ahead. This requires the ego vehicle to avoid getting too close to the edge of the road.\n\nTo the left of the road, temporary yellow construction barriers are separating the active road from a construction zone. These barriers highlight the narrowed road space due to construction, and thus the ego vehicle must stay within lane boundaries and keep a safe distance from the barriers. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, additional traffic signs, or other objects in the scene that would affect driving behavior."
