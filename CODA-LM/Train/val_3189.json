It is positioned on the left side of the road but is partially extending into the left lane. This truck poses a potential hazard as it may block or restrict the drivable pathway due to its encroachment on the lane. Additionally, multiple red and white traffic cones are lined up, separating the driving lanes, indicating that drivers will have to shift lanes or merge due to a lane closure or ongoing roadwork. These cones serve as guidance for the ego vehicle's navigation around the road obstruction. Furthermore, metal barriers are installed on the right side of the road, suggesting the possibility of work zone activity or restrictions on roadside access. These barriers are there to protect work areas on the road and signal that it is prohibited to drive beyond them, altering the available driving space. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects present in the scene that need to be considered."
