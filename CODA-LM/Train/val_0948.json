This motorcyclist should be cautiously observed by the ego car's driving system since they are a potential dynamic obstacle that might change speed or direction abruptly, requiring the vehicle to be ready to respond to avoid accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there is greenery on both sides of the road. Even though it is not blocking the road, it requires the ego vehicle to remain vigilant as animals or pedestrians could be obscured by the greenery and unexpectedly enter the road, which would necessitate an immediate response from the ego car to ensure safety. \n\nNo other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other notable objects have been reported in the image."
