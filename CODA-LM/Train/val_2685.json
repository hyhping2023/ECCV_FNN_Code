        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a few notable road users and objects that the autonomous vehicle must consider. Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a concrete mixer truck moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Due to the truck's large size and the possibility of it making sudden movements or stops, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bus in the left adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, also moving in the same direction. The bus's size and its potential to change lanes or stop to pick up passengers means that the ego car must stay alert and be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.\n\nWhile traffic lights are not currently visible in the camera's field of view, this suggests that the ego vehicle must remain vigilant for any upcoming traffic signals that may dictate the need to change speed or come to a stop.\n\nLastly, there are white barricades on the right side of the road, running parallel to the ego vehicle. These barricades serve as a fixed separation between the lanes of traffic, limiting the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right. The presence of these barriers requires the ego car to consider other maneuvering options if needed."

Buses typically travel on designated routes and adhere to specific timetables. The presence of a bus might mean occasional stops; thus, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and remain vigilant for any passengers embarking or disembarking. Buses can make frequent stops, potentially affecting traffic flow and requiring other vehicles to reduce speed or stop.",

It features a large rotating drum to keep the concrete mix from solidifying. Drivers should be cautious when driving near construction vehicles, as they often make unexpected movements and may stop or slow down unexpectedly to carry out construction tasks. Additionally, such vehicles may be entering or exiting construction sites, potentially leading to sudden traffic changes or road blockages.",

Be alert for any signals given by the bus in the left lane, including brake lights and turn signals, as it may affect the traffic flow or require the ego vehicle to change lanes. Since the traffic lights are not visible, the ego vehicle must stay attentive to any upcoming signals and be prepared to act accordingly. The barricades on the right limit the ability to change lanes in that direction, so any maneuvers to overtake the concrete mixer should be planned with caution and awareness of other vehicles in the left lane."
