Details are difficult to discern due to darkness and glare, but visible tail lights signify the presence of these vehicles. As a result, the ego car should be ready to stop or decelerate, maintaining a safe distance to prevent any collisions.\n\nTraffic Signs: There is a yellow sign on the right side of the road which seems to convey a warning or instruction. Although it's not possible to read the text due to the distance and the quality of the image, the significance of such signs typically pertains to road conditions or changes in traffic patterns. Consequently, the ego car is advised to proceed with increased caution and awareness.\n\nTraffic Cones: A pattern of orange traffic cones is evident, delineating a temporary lane on the road, likely directing a merge or a lane shift. The ego vehicle must adjust its course and reduce speed to navigate this modified traffic route safely.\n\nOther Objects: A bright glare from oncoming headlights is present, which can potentially impair the vision of both the ego car's sensors and the driver. Caution is advised in proceeding to mitigate the risks of vision impairment.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers that would impact the driving behavior."
