Ahead and to the right, there are multiple vehicles in what appears to be a traffic jam or slow-moving traffic, indicating that the ego vehicle must navigate the congestion carefully. Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a car with its brake lights on, signaling that it is slowing down or stopped, which means the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic lights visible ahead with red lights illuminated, indicating that the ego vehicle must come to a stop if it's at the signal or prepare to stop if it's approaching. To the right of the ego vehicle, there is a barrier with a yellow and black chevron pattern, signaling a curve or a redirection in the traffic flow that the ego vehicle will need to navigate.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Observing the traffic lights and the behavior of other vehicles is crucial for deciding when to safely proceed."
