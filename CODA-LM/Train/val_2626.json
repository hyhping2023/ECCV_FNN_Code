This truck could potentially start operations or move, affecting the traffic flow and presenting a risk if the leg is not fully retracted. Additionally, there are several cars in the lanes adjacent to the ego car, both ahead and to the left, in various colors, with white and black being predominant. These vehicles are important as they dictate the flow of traffic and potential lane changes that the ego car may need to consider.\n\nFurthermore, there are concrete barriers on the right side of the road, which separate the road from a construction or off-road area. These barriers are significant as they limit the maneuverability of the ego car and indicate the presence of a construction zone.\n\nLastly, there is an extended side-view mirror from a truck on the left, which is encroaching into the ego vehicle's lane. This poses a collision risk if the ego car were to drift towards the left.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones."
