The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance from this car to react appropriately if the car in front brakes suddenly. Additionally, a cyclist is present to the right of the ego car's lane, also traveling in the same direction as the traffic. The ego car must keep an eye on the cyclist to prevent any accidents, particularly if the cyclist makes unexpected moves or if the ego car needs to switch lanes. Red barriers are installed on both sides of the road, suggesting possible road work or alterations in the road layout ahead. These barriers are meant to direct the traffic flow, and the ego car must adhere to the lane boundaries to navigate safely through the potential construction area. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."

The barriers are designed to absorb the impact in case of a vehicle collision, enhancing safety for drivers. These barriers indicate that part of the road or lane is closed off for construction, guiding the ego car to stay in the open lanes and possibly causing a reduction in driving speed to accommodate the narrowed driving path.",

No lane changes should be made without ensuring it's safe to do so, especially considering the roadwork barriers that may limit maneuvering space."
