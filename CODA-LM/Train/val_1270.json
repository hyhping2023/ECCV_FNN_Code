        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a yellow construction vehicle positioned in the center of the road ahead of the ego car, with its back facing towards the ego car. The construction vehicle appears to be stationary or moving very slowly. This vehicle is likely involved in construction or maintenance work and represents a potential obstacle for the ego car. Due to its presence, traffic flow may be disrupted, leading to slow movement or potential stops for the vehicles on the road, including the ego car. Careful navigation may be required to avoid this obstruction and maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light hanging over the road, but its exact signal cannot be determined from the current angle of the image. This requires the ego vehicle to be particularly vigilant in order to make appropriate driving decisions. The inaccessibility of the traffic light's signal complicates the driving scenario, as it is essential to understand whether the ego car has the right of way or needs to prepare for stopping, proceeding, or yielding based on the traffic light's indication."

This vehicle is characterized by its large storage bin at the rear, which is used for transporting materials such as soil, gravel, and sand. When encountered on the road, such vehicles often indicate nearby construction sites. They may enter or exit construction sites frequently, therefore, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or changes in the truck's direction. This ensures sufficient reaction time for any unpredictable movements made by the construction vehicle.",

The ego vehicle should be ready to adjust its path if directed by any temporary road signs, signals from a worker, or movement of the construction vehicle. It is also advisable to keep a safe following distance from the construction vehicle in case it makes sudden stops or turns."
