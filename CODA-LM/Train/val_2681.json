        "description and explanation": "The image displays a traffic scenario with notable features including vehicles, but no presence of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects. Specifically, the vehicle category consists of three large cement/construction trucks that are parked on the right side of the road. The notable point about these trucks is that they may obstruct part of the road, which warrants caution from drivers when they are passing by. This is the only significant observation from the image, as other common road elements like pedestrians, signs, and lights are absent."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, identifiable by its large size, high structure, and bulky equipment integral for building or roadwork purposes. Due to its dimension and type, it generally moves at a slower speed and may cause temporary obstructions. In traffic, the presence of such a vehicle often requires other drivers, including the ego car, to reduce speed and increase following distance to accommodate potential unexpected stops or maneuvers.",

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck, recognizable by its large cylindrical mixing drum designed to mix and transport concrete to construction sites. The presence of such a vehicle on the road often implies nearby construction work, suggesting potentially slower traffic ahead due to possible lane closures or diversions. Its operation can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution, a reduced speed, and readiness to adjust routes depending on road conditions and potential obstacles.",
