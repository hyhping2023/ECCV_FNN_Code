        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, a tanker truck is observed parked on the right side of the road, partially off the road with its rear end facing the ego vehicle. It is important to be cautious around this truck as it could disrupt the normal traffic flow and may initiate movement unexpectedly, posing potential risks to nearby vehicles. Additionally, there are sedan-type vehicles visible in the distance, traveling on the same road as the ego vehicle but moving away. The presence of these vehicles necessitates attention, as changes in traffic dynamics could influence how the ego car should operate.\n\nTo manage traffic around the parked truck, orange traffic cones have been arranged on the road, creating a taper that instructs vehicles to divert from the parked truck to the left, into the adjacent lane. This arrangement signals the necessity for the ego vehicle to merge leftward to avoid the stationary truck.\n\nMetal guard rails are installed along the right side of the roadway, serving as a physical delimiter between the road and the adjacent terrain. These barriers are critical in guiding the driving path and restricting vehicular movement solely to the designated roadway area."
