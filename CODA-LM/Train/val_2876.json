However, on the sidewalk, there are vulnerable road users to be cognizant of: two parked motor scooters, one leaning to the left and the other standing upright. There is no immediate danger posed to the ego car, but caution is advised as the scooter owners might return and move them unexpectedly, potentially into the path of the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic signs to be aware of. The first is a no parking sign to the right of the image, placed against a brick wall. This sign is important for the ego car to recognize, as it informs the driver that parking is not allowed in this area, which reduces the number of parking options available. The second sign is a directional road sign featuring two blue arrows pointing left, mounted on the building. This sign implies the presence of a nearby turn or area where the road merges, indicating that the ego car may need to prepare to change direction.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this image that impact the driving conditions for the ego car."
