There are two traffic signs: one is a blue sign overhead on the right side showing directions to places, indicating directions but not requiring immediate action; the other is a yellow and red striped sign at road level on the right side in front of a construction area, warning of roadwork ahead and urging caution and readiness for unexpected obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple orange traffic cones lined up diagonally across the right lane, indicating that the right lane is closed ahead and vehicles need to merge left. The ego car should prepare to change lanes if currently in the right lane.\n\nVisible in the right lane are barricades with yellow and black stripes associated with the construction work, serving as physical barriers to prevent entering the construction zone. This suggests that the right lane is not passable, and vehicles must use the left lane.\n\nFurthermore, construction machinery, including a yellow crane beyond the barriers on the right side of the road, presents a potential hazard, indicating ongoing construction and the presence of workers, requiring the driver to stay alert."
