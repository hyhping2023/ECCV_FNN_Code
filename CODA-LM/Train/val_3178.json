A white pickup truck is also noticed parked or stationary on the right side ahead, which doesn't currently affect the driving path but warrants vigilance in case it begins to move.\n\nVulnerable road users in the scene consist of a pedestrian crossing the intersection from left to right in front of the forklift, which impacts the ego car's driving decision, possibly requiring the car to slow down or stop to yield. Additionally, two maintenance workers are spotted, with one standing on the median and another walking around the intersection, indicating the need for the ego car to remain observant and ready to halt due to the possibility of sudden movement into the road.\n\nConcerning traffic signs, there is a blue circular sign featuring a white car and bicycle symbol on the right side of the road, signaling the ego car to watch for shared lane usage with bicycles and cars.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that need to be considered in this image, as per the provided data."
