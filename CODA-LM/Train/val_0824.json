On the right side of the road, there is a group of pedestrians behind a barrier, appearing to be waiting or working. Although they are not on the roadway, their proximity to the roadside is a safety concern and may influence the ego vehicle's lane choice and speed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple road work signs on the right side and overhead gantries indicating ongoing road work. These signs typically require drivers to adhere to reduced speed limits and exercise increased caution while passing through the construction zone. The traffic lights overhead are showing red for the lanes moving straight and green for a turning lane, which means the ego car must stop due to the red light for its lane, preparing to stop in accordance with traffic regulations.\n\nYellow and black traffic cones are positioned along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, suggesting a lane narrowing or diversion. These cones guide vehicles and necessitate reduced speed and heightened alertness to maintain a safe lane position. Red and white barriers are placed along the center dividing line of the road, indicating a separation of traffic flows. These barriers ensure the ego car stays in the correct lane and is alert to the restricted road width due to the worksite. There are no other objects reported in the image."
