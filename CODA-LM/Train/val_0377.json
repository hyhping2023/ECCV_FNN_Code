A white sedan is located in the left lane ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust its speed or switch lanes if the sedan slows down or stops.\n2. A van is positioned in the center lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. Since it is in a different lane and moving at traffic speed, the ego car should monitor it in case the van changes lanes or stops unexpectedly.\n3. There are various vehicles in the opposite lanes, constituting oncoming traffic. While these vehicles do not directly influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions, they should be observed for general awareness.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There are directional arrows on the road indicating that the lanes go straight. The ego car should follow these lane markings and proceed straight unless a lane change is needed for a future turn or maneuver.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A traffic light is visible, showing red for the lane that the ego car is in. The ego car should come to a complete stop at the traffic light and wait for it to turn green before proceeding.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Traffic cones are placed around a pink barrier on the right side of the right lane. The cones and barrier indicate that the right lane may be partially obstructed or closed ahead, and the ego car should remain in its current lane or prepare to change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
