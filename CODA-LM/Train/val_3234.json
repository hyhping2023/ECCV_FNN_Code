The size of the truck is making it difficult for the driver to stay within the lane boundaries, which impacts the flow of other traffic. The presence of the mixer truck could lead to other vehicles having to slow down or stop suddenly to accommodate its movement.\n\nAdditionally, there are bright orange traffic cones placed along the right-side lane, signaling that there is a section of the road closed or under maintenance, which requires drivers to merge into the left lane to continue their journey.\n\nComplementing the cones, there is a temporary plastic barrier, distinct in its bright pink color, also in the right-side lane. This barrier emphasizes the closed area of the road, working alongside the cones to alert drivers of the need to move into the other lane to bypass the section under construction. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or any other objects affecting the traffic in the image provided."
