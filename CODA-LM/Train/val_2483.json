The taxi is currently stationary, but it may affect traffic flow due to possible pick-up or drop-off activities.\n\nAdditionally, there are several traffic cones and barriers on the right side of the road, indicating that drivers should merge to the left. These are in place to guide traffic away from lane closures or roadwork, necessitating a change in the ego vehicle's lane position.\n\nA line of plastic water-filled barriers is also present, creating a separation between the traffic lane and a construction zone or closed area. This arrangement limits the available driving space to a single lane, potentially leading to a bottleneck situation.\n\nFurthermore, there is a guard booth positioned on the right, with an individual standing outside near the roadway. The proximity of the booth and the person to the road could be hazardous if the individual steps onto the road unexpectedly."
