Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in the distance driving in the same direction as the ego car on adjacent lanes. The ego car should keep a safe following distance and be alert for any potential lane changes or braking from these vehicles.\n\nA 'no left turn' traffic sign is present on the right side of the road, illuminated by a street light, signaling that no vehicle should make a left turn at the upcoming intersection.\n\nThe traffic light ahead shows green for the lane the ego car is in, while the left turn signal is red. This means the ego car is clear to proceed straight through the intersection but is prohibited from making a left turn.\n\nLastly, there is a waste bin located on the sidewalk by the street on the right. While it is not a hazard as it is off the roadway, it should be monitored in case it is unexpectedly knocked onto the road."
