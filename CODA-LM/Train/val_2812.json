There are two vehicles: a white car in the left lane ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction, which may slow down, change lanes, or maintain its speed, affecting the ego car's driving strategy. Additionally, there is a gray car in the right lane, slightly ahead and moving in the same direction, possibly merging into the ego car's lane or adjusting its speed, which necessitates the ego car's reactive measures.\n\nA green highway entrance sign is observed on the left side of the road, indicating an upcoming junction or interchange. This sign suggests that the ego car should be prepared for merging traffic or consider taking an exit if needed.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is visible on the right side of the right lane, pointing towards a potential hazard or road work. This presence implies that the ego car should stay in its lane and be cautious of possible obstacles or ongoing road work ahead.\n\nFinally, green metal barriers are seen on both sides of the highway, defining the road boundaries. These barriers indicate the absence of a shoulder to pull over in an emergency, calling for increased vigilance from the ego car."

It is a small, usually orange, conical marker employed on roads or sidewalks to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner during road work or accidents. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone implies there could be some form of hazard or construction ahead.
