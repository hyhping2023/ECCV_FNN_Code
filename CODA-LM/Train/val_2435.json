There is a white car on the left side, partially sharing the lane with the autonomous vehicle. The proximity of this car suggests it might merge into the autonomous vehicle's lane, posing a potential obstacle should the vehicle intend to change lanes.\n2. A blue excavation vehicle is present on the right side of the road, where construction activity is noticeable. This vehicle's presence implies a construction zone, alerting the autonomous vehicle to anticipate traffic disruptions and watch for potential hazards from the ongoing work.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. A construction worker is located adjacent to the excavation vehicle on the right. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle must exercise extra caution to ensure the safety of the worker.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. There's a blue parking sign on the left, which may point to parking regulations within the area. While it does not directly affect current driving behavior, it hints that there might be parked cars further down the road.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n1. Traffic cones are arranged around the excavation vehicle, forming a makeshift barrier. These cones are indicative of a potential lane closure or narrowing, guiding the autonomous vehicle to possibly switch lanes or decrease speed as appropriate.\n\nThe scene does not contain any traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that could affect driving behavior. All of these identified elements together provide context for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the environment safely and effectively."
