This vehicle may slow down, turn, or change lanes, directly influencing the driving behavior of the ego car. Additionally, a parked green truck is on the right shoulder of the road ahead of the ego vehicle. This parked truck could potentially obstruct the view or movement, requiring the ego car to keep a safe distance or change lanes if necessary.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users present, specifically a group of pedestrians on the right side of the road, beyond the parked truck. Their proximity to the roadway could pose a risk if any pedestrian steps onto the road; thus, the ego car needs to monitor them and be prepared to stop.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, a blue sign with a white arrow indicates a merging lane or a rest area to the right. This informs the ego car of possible merging traffic or an opportunity to exit the road to the rest area.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are placed on the right edge of the road before the parked truck. These cones indicate the need for caution and potential lane narrowing or roadworks.\n\nOverall, the presence of vehicles, pedestrians, a traffic sign, and traffic cones requires the ego car to stay alert and adjust its driving behavior accordingly."
