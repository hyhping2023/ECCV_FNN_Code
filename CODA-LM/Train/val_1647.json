No traffic signs or traffic lights are present in the scene depicted. However, there are traffic cones placed on the right side of the lane, indicating there might be some road work or obstructions ahead, which could lead to a partial or full blockage of the lane, requiring the ego car to potentially change lanes to navigate past the obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there's a long blue barrier with red and white striped tape on top, extending along the right side of the road. This barrier is indicative of ongoing construction or a closed-off area, suggesting that the accessible road space for vehicles could be narrowed, impacting driving behavior and lane accessibility.\n\nMoreover, there is a large yellow crane situated beyond the blue barrier, on the right side of the road. It is presumably being used for construction work. The presence of this heavy machinery indicates active construction and raises the possibility of encountering unexpected obstructions, or construction workers in proximity to the road, which would require additional caution when driving through the area."

It is often orange and made from a soft plastic or rubber, featuring a reflective strip to enhance visibility. In this driving scenario, its presence on the road likely indicates a nearby hazard, construction area, or a change in traffic flow.
