As a result, the ego car may need to slow down or change lanes to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, pedestrians are visible in the distance on the right, walking along the sidewalk parallel to the road. The presence of these pedestrians suggests that the ego car should remain cautious and be prepared to stop if someone unexpectedly enters the roadway.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are directional signs mounted on a pole. These signs are important as they provide information about potential turns or exits that may affect the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, green fencing barriers are present on the right side along the sidewalk, which are likely related to the nearby construction activity. These barriers indicate that there may be disruptions or obstructions on or near the road, and caution is advised.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."
