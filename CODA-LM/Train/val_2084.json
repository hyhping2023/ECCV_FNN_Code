This cement mixer is large and potentially carrying a heavy load, which may affect its ability to brake quickly. Due to its size and weight, the cement mixer may behave unpredictably on the road, necessitating that the ego car maintain a safe following distance to react to any abrupt changes in the mixerâ€™s speed or direction.\n\nA mandatory direction traffic sign indicates that all vehicles in this lane must turn right at the intersection ahead. This means the ego car must prepare to turn right at the upcoming intersection in compliance with the sign.\n\nThe traffic light state is not visible in the image, so its condition and the need to respond to it cannot be determined. As such, the ego car should approach the intersection with caution and be prepared to stop or proceed based on the actual traffic light seen as it gets closer.\n\nBarriers are present on the left side of the ego car, separating it from oncoming traffic lanes. These barriers limit the ability of the ego car to maneuver to the left, imposing a constraint on lateral movements."

Additionally, due to its large size and heavy load, it may move slower and make sudden stops to align with construction demands, which requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential delays in traffic flow.",
