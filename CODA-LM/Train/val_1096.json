            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck is depicted. This type of vehicle is generally larger and heavier than regular cars, featuring a rotating drum used to mix and transport concrete. The presence of this vehicle affects driving behavior as it necessitates increased following distance due to its extended stopping distance and potential debris fallout from the rotating drum. Additionally, its wide turns require other drivers to maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions, especially on narrower streets or during maneuvers.",
