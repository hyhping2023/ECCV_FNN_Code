        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, several road users and objects affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, categorized into vehicles, traffic lights, and traffic cones.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there are two notable ones in the scene. Firstly, a large cement mixer truck is positioned on the opposite side of the road, facing towards the direction of the autonomous car and occupying the rightmost lane. The size and location of this truck near the center of the road could limit the autonomous vehicle's maneuverability, particularly with oncoming traffic present. Secondly, a white sedan is observed parked on the right-hand side of the road, partially on the curb and also encroaching onto the roadway. The positioning of this parked car could lead other vehicles to merge into the autonomous vehicle's lane to circumvent it, additionally hampering visibility ahead for the autonomous vehicle.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, there is one in the distance, although the signal color cannot be identified in the current view. The traffic light's status is essential for the autonomous vehicle's decision-making process, dictating whether to continue moving or halt, thereby ensuring the right of way at intersections is correctly adhered to.\n\nA traffic cone is mentioned as well, situated near the middle of the road ahead and encroaching into the autonomous vehicle's lane. This cone likely signals a construction zone or a road hazard, necessitating a lane change or a speed reduction by the autonomous vehicle to safely navigate the area.\n\nThe summary provided covers all visible and relevant road users in the image, integral to the autonomous vehicle's navigational decisions."
