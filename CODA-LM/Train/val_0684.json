A cyclist is also present in the center of the image, riding away from the perspective of the ego car in the same lane, directly influencing the driving path of the ego vehicle and posing a potential hazard if not given appropriate space.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian crossing warning sign located to the left of the road, indicating the potential presence of pedestrians and suggesting that the ego car should be attentive to any such activity. Several traffic cones and yellow barriers are marking construction to the left side of the road, delineating a construction area, limiting the usable width of the road, and warranting caution. A continuous red and white barrier on the left may necessitate a lane change or at least awareness of restricted lane usage if the ego car is traveling in that lane.\n\nLastly, there are market stalls and pedestrians on the right side sidewalk. While these objects do not impede the road, there's a potential for pedestrians to enter the roadway, requiring monitoring by the ego vehicle. Traffic lights are not present in the image, and thus, there is no information regarding them to consider."
