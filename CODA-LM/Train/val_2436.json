However, there are vulnerable road users and barriers that are noteworthy. Specifically, a motorcyclist with a side cart is directly in front of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. The presence of the motorcyclist is significant as it necessitates caution due to their reduced protection and potential instability compared to a four-wheeled vehicle. Additionally, a small dog is spotted on the right side of the road ahead, facing towards the road. The dog poses a potential hazard as it may enter the road, creating a risk for both itself and other road users. Furthermore, barriers are present on the right side of the road, delineating the road from a pedestrian area. These barriers are important as they may reduce the available road space for navigation and limit the options for evasive maneuvers if they become necessary."

This requires the ego vehicle to maintain a careful watch and possibly reduce speed to prevent an accident or sudden movement from the dog interfering with the path of the vehicle.",
