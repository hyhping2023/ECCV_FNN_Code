This vehicle does not directly affect the ego car's path but should be observed in case it unexpectedly veers into the ego car's lane. Additionally, ahead of the ego car is another vehicle showing taillights, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Monitoring the speed and distance of this vehicle is necessary to maintain a safe following distance. On the right side of the road, there are two pedestrians walking in the same direction as the ego car. The potential of them attempting to cross the road necessitates the ego car's readiness to reduce speed or come to a stop if needed. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

In this scenario, this barrier may indicate that either roadwork is ongoing ahead or a section of the road is closed for some reason.
