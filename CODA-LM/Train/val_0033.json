The behavior of this vehicle necessitates that the ego vehicle also slows down and prepares to stop. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles on the opposite side of the road, seemingly waiting for the traffic light to change. While these vehicles do not immediately impact the ego car's driving decisions, they do provide insight into the traffic flow and potential cross-traffic once the lights change.\n\nThe traffic light ahead of the ego vehicle displays a green light for going straight and a red pedestrian signal. This allows the ego vehicle to proceed through the intersection but also signals the need to stay vigilant for pedestrians who might ignore the pedestrian signal.\n\nFurthermore, red and white striped traffic cones are positioned on the corner of the sidewalk near the crosswalk, directing pedestrian traffic away from possible road works or hazards. These cones suggest there may be an obstruction and that pedestrians could be walking closer to the ego vehicle's path than usual."
