        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are several notable road users and objects that potentially affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle.\n\nFirstly, regarding vehicles, there are two parked cars described. One is a white SUV positioned on the right side of the ego vehicle, angled towards the road, which could be preparing to merge into traffic or unloading passengers. This SUV may obscure the view for other road users and poses a hazard if it suddenly moves into the lane. The second vehicle is a red sedan, also parked on the right side of the road, but slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Although it's not an immediate threat, the sedan restricts the maneuvering space for the ego vehicle, making navigation more challenging.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are two pedestrians noted. The first pedestrian is crossing the street from right to left directly in front of the ego vehicle, necessitating immediate attention as they have the right of way. The second pedestrian, who is walking a dog, is further ahead on the right side, moving away from the ego vehicle and parallel to the road. Though not an immediate threat, the pedestrian and dog need to be monitored in case they unpredictably enter the roadway.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in this image, indicating that such elements either do not affect the current driving conditions of the ego vehicle or are absent from the scene."
