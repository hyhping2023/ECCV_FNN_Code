This parked car does not impact the immediate driving path as it is stationary and properly parked. Following this dark car, there are several other cars lined up and parked in the same manner on the right side of the road, also facing away. These vehicles, too, are not a threat to the ego car's current route of travel. \n\nAdditionally, there is a three-wheeled blue vehicle on the right, facing the ego vehicle but currently stationary. The position of this vehicle suggests that it may enter into the traffic flow at some point, and hence the ego vehicle needs to remain aware of its movements.\n\nNoteworthy is the presence of vulnerable road users, including pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right. Among the pedestrians is an individual with a child and a stroller. Although they are on the sidewalk, the ego vehicle must be cautious and prepared to stop if they unexpectedly attempt to cross the road.\n\nAn array of orange traffic cones is present on the right side of the road, signaling roadwork or an area that should be avoided when driving. The cones necessitate a slight leftward shift in the ego car's path to maintain a safe distance from any possible hazards associated with the roadwork.\n\nIn this image, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects described that affect the autonomous driving scenario."
