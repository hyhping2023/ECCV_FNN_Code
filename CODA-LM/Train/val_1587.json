Directly in front, but in the right lane, there's a motorcyclist with uncertain lateral movement which necessitates maintaining a safe distance and readiness for evasive action.\n\nAdditionally, a blue pedestrian crossing sign to the right must be heeded for the potential presence of pedestrians. Some orange traffic cones demarcate the rightmost side of the road due to construction work, guiding the ego vehicle to remain alert and in the current lane. A metal fence runs parallel to the right side of the road, indicating that pedestrian access is unlikely from that direction. Lastly, a parked green bus behind the cones suggests a need for watchfulness for pedestrians or vehicles that might enter the road when the bus departs."
