Firstly, there is a series of orange and white traffic cones positioned on the right side of the road. These cones are indicative of a closed lane or ongoing road works, signaling to the autonomous vehicle the need to adjust its lane position to maintain safety and compliance with road regulations.\n\nSecondly, an obstruction is present in the form of a large white bag or debris located in the middle of the rightmost lane. This unexpected object poses a potential risk of causing obstruction or damage to the vehicle, requiring immediate attention for a lane change or other navigational maneuvers to avoid any complications.\n\nThe absence of vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers in the provided data indicates a focused need for the autonomous driving system to adapt to changes related to road works and unexpected obstacles, ensuring a safe and efficient travel experience."
