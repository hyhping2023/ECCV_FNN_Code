This forklift poses a potential hazard as it may move unexpectedly or turn, which could affect the ego car's trajectory. Additionally, a red car is visible ahead of the ego car in the left lane, traveling in the same direction. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from this red car and be prepared for actions like braking or changing lanes. Further, several vehicles including a taxi and white cars are parked on the right side of the road behind the forklift, reducing the road's width. The ego car must be cautious not to enter the oncoming traffic lane while bypassing the forklift.\n\nA cyclist is observed in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car and moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to monitor this cyclist closely and maintain a safe distance as the cyclist might change direction or swerve.\n\nMoreover, a blue and white construction barrier is situated on the right side of the road, adjacent to the parked vehicles. This barrier indicates a construction zone or a blocked area, guiding the ego car to avoid this side of the road."

It is commonly used in construction and industrial areas for lifting and moving materials over short distances. As this vehicle is large and typically slower moving, the presence of such a vehicle in this traffic scenario indicates that there may be nearby construction or loading activities. The ego car must exercise caution while driving in this vicinity, maintaining a safe distance and being prepared for sudden stops or shifts from the forklift.

It is advisable to signal when changing lanes and remain vigilant for any further unexpected movements from the forklift or the cyclist."
