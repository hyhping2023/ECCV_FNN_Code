A sedan car is parked to the left of the ego vehicle, facing the same direction. Although it isn't a hazard at the moment, there is the potential risk that it could start moving and enter traffic without warning.\n2. The street ahead has several vehicles parked on both sides, including a conspicuous white van on the left. This setting indicates a busy area and suggests the possibility of pedestrians crossing or vehicles joining the traffic, urging a cautious approach with reduced speed and readiness to stop if necessary.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- Pedestrian crossing signs are noticeable on both sides of the pedestrian crossing up ahead, signaling that the ego vehicle should anticipate and give way to pedestrians at the crossing due to likely pedestrian activity.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There are pedestrian crossing warning signs placed on both sides of the road, alerting the ego vehicle's driver to be vigilant and prepared to halt for pedestrians at the nearby marked zebra crossing.\n\nBarriers:\n- Temporary green barriers are located alongside parked trash bins to the right near the pedestrian crossing, possibly suggesting road work or areas that should be avoided. The ego vehicle needs to stay watchful for any workers or unexpected impediments in this area.\n\nOther Objects:\n- Trash bins are lined up on the right side of the road. They could hide pedestrians or animals, so the ego vehicle must approach with care, aware that these users could step out into the road at any moment.\n\nNo traffic lights or traffic cones are present in this traffic scenario."
