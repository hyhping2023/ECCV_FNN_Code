This indicates that traffic is stopped or slowing, requiring the ego car to prepare to stop or proceed at a low speed. Additionally, multiple other vehicles can be seen ahead and in adjacent lanes, all stationary with illuminated tail lights, suggesting heavy traffic or a traffic signal ahead. This necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared to stop.\n\nIn between the lanes on the right, a cyclist is making their way through the stationary traffic. This presents a potential hazard as the cyclist may move into the ego carâ€™s lane suddenly, necessitating heightened awareness and readiness to brake if needed.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego car, the traffic light is red, requiring the vehicle to come to a complete stop and wait for the light to change before proceeding.\n\nOn the side of the road, various illuminated billboards and signs are visible, although they do not direct traffic. These should be noted in case they obscure relevant traffic signals or signs. Additionally, a pedestrian is visible on the sidewalk to the right but is not currently affecting traffic. The ego car should monitor the pedestrian to ensure they do not unexpectedly enter the roadway."

A stroller generally indicates the presence of a pedestrian, likely an adult with a child, making their way across the street. For the ego car, this necessitates an increased alertness and preparedness to stop or slow down to ensure the safety of pedestrians. The ego car must adhere to traffic regulations that require vehicles to give right of way to pedestrians in crosswalks. It is essential for the ego car to monitor this stroller's movement closely as it approaches the crosswalk area.",

Once the traffic light turns green, the ego car should proceed with caution, especially if the cyclist is still navigating the nearby traffic."
