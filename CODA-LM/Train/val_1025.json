This indicates that the van is either slowing down or has come to a stop. The presence of the van's brake lights suggests that the ego car should also prepare to slow down or stop to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, a red stop light is visible above the van, mounted on a traffic signal pole. This red light mandates that the ego car, along with other vehicles, must stop and wait for the light to change to green before proceeding. This is further emphasized by another observation of the traffic light in the image, which exhibits a red signal, reinforcing the requirement for all vehicles in the lane, including the ego car, to come to a complete stop.\n\nMoreover, yellow reflective traffic cones are positioned on both sides of the ego car's lane, creating a pathway. These cones indicate a potential lane narrowing or detour ahead. Consequently, the ego car is advised to proceed with caution, ensuring it stays within the designated path marked by the cones.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car, as these categories are not represented in the observed image."
