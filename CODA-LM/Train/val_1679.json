Firstly, there is a blue truck in the left lane ahead of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. The truck's position and movement are important to monitor in case it makes unexpected maneuvers or stops. Additionally, a red truck is partially visible on the right side of the blue truck, also in motion. The proximity of these large vehicles could reduce visibility for the ego car, which means increased attention and preparedness for any sudden changes in the traffic situation are necessary.\n\nThe image also includes traffic signs, specifically several arrow signs mounted on a barrier. These signs indicate that the road ahead is split, with the left side leading to a turn and the right side continuing forward. This information is crucial as it necessitates a driving decision about which path to follow.\n\nFurthermore, orange and white traffic cones are arranged in a line demarcating the split in the road. These cones are there to guide traffic and indicate areas that are off-limits, ensuring the ego car stays within the designated lane.\n\nLastly, there are temporary barrier panels placed at the road split, which may indicate construction or a road closure ahead. These barriers are meant to prevent vehicles from entering a restricted area and to channel traffic safely around a potential hazard or construction zone.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
