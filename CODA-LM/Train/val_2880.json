        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and a traffic sign that the ego car must consider. Firstly, there is a white delivery truck on the left side of the ego car, slightly ahead and partially occupying the ego car's lane. The presence of the truck may necessitate the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to prevent a collision. Additionally, a forklift is positioned on the right side of the road, facing the ego car and engaged in work activities. The forklift poses a risk of entering the ego car's path unexpectedly, which would require the ego car to be ready to stop or navigate around it. There is also a three-wheeled blue vehicle on the right side, moving in the same direction as the ego car and close to the curb. The smaller size and slower speed of this vehicle might compel the ego car to switch lanes to overtake it safely.\n\nFurthermore, there is a yellow warning sign indicating a T-junction ahead. This sign is important as it alerts the ego car to an upcoming intersection where it may need to yield or come to a stop. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a forklift. It is typically used for lifting and transporting heavy materials over short distances, particularly within construction sites or industrial environments. In this traffic scenario, the presence of the construction vehicle on the road indicates potential slow-moving traffic and possibly temporary obstructions. The ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden stops or slow movement ahead. Additionally, the vehicle's activity might involve frequent stopping and turning, potentially requiring heightened awareness and reduced speed from all nearby drivers.",
