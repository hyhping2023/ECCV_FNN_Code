        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two categories of road users present, which are traffic cones and other objects. The traffic cones observed are described as orange cones with reflective stripes placed in a line on the right side of the lane. The reason these cones affect the driving behavior of the ego car is that they indicate a closed lane or a change in the traffic pattern, requiring the ego car to stay to the left. Additionally, there are other objects in the scene, specifically described as bright lights directly ahead from an oncoming vehicle. The presence of these bright lights is significant because the glare could reduce visibility and distract the driver. This necessitates a reduction in speed and an increase in caution while navigating the area."

Made from a bright orange material with a reflective band, it serves to alert drivers of potential hazards, direct traffic flow, or indicate ongoing road work. The presence of this cone in the driving scenario indicates that the ego car may need to reduce speed and maneuver carefully to avoid this marked area, ensuring the safety of potential road workers or navigating around a hazard.",
