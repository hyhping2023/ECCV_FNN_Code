This van suggests it may be in the process of picking up or dropping off passengers, thus occupying the lane.\n   - Additionally, several vehicles are observed in the opposite lane, their headlights illuminated, indicating it is nighttime. These vehicles affect the traffic flow and could impact the ego car's maneuvers, such as overtaking.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A pedestrian is crossing the road in front of the stationary van, appearing to be in mid-step with a forward gait. This pedestrian poses an immediate hazard both to themselves and to the ego vehicle.\n\n3. **Other Objects**:\n   - There is a bus stop shelter on the right side of the road, which is illuminated from within. The bus stop suggests there could be additional pedestrians or stopped vehicles nearby, which the ego vehicle needs to be aware of."
