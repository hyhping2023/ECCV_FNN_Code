It is partially on the road and is blocking the right lane. This forklift obstructs the right lane, which requires the autonomous vehicle to change lanes to maintain a safe distance and pass it safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light directly ahead, showing a red signal. The red light requires the autonomous vehicle to come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nFurthermore, there are temporary construction barriers on the right side of the road, suggesting road work or a closed lane. These barriers indicate a potential hazard or restriction on the right side of the road, necessitating caution and possibly a lane change by the autonomous vehicle.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

Forklifts are often used in construction and logistics areas for moving heavy materials over short distances. In the current traffic situation, its presence indicates active work in the vicinity. The vehicle should be approached with caution, as it may make sudden movements or might be crossing or entering the roadway unexpectedly. This could necessitate a reduction in speed or even a temporary halt in the ego cars progress to ensure safety, especially if the forklift is maneuvering or if there are workers nearby.",
