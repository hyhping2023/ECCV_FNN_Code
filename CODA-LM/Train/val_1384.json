Additionally, there are hanging rectangular signs on a pole to the right side of the road. Although their content is not legible, their placement suggests that they could contain important information for drivers.\n\nA series of traffic cones are positioned to the right of the ego car, in front of some parked bicycles. These cones likely indicate an area of the road or sidewalk that is off limits, possibly designating a no parking or construction zone. Moreover, there are parked bicycles next to these traffic cones. They do not pose an immediate hazard, but if someone were to approach to use one, the ego car might need to yield.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or barriers are observed in the image, and thus, these categories were omitted from the summary."
