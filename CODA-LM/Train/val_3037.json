This vehicle poses a potential hazard as it could unexpectedly re-enter the traffic flow or cause other vehicles to swerve into the ego car's lane. Further ahead, several cars and a yellow taxi are following the direction of traffic on the same side of the road. These vehicles may affect the traffic flow by slowing down, stopping, or changing lanes, requiring the ego car to react accordingly.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, several pedestrians are visible, with one potentially stepping onto the road or near its boundary. Pedestrians close to the road may enter the driving lane unexpectedly, necessitating the ego car to be prepared for sudden stopping or maneuvering.\n\nA blue traffic sign with directional information is present on the right side of the road, indicating a junction or designated area that may influence traffic behavior and merging patterns ahead. The current state of the traffic lights is not visible in the image, so the ego car must rely on real-time observation to determine their status and respond appropriately.\n\nBlue and white traffic cones are placed on the right side, marking the boundary of the roadway and the parking lane, designating a dedicated area for parking and narrowing the usable roadway for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green stool on the side of the road near the parked white sedan. Such objects are considered hazards that could be moved onto the roadway by external factors and should be monitored.\n\nNo barriers are present in the image, and no other categories of road users are mentioned, indicating that they are not applicable in this scenario."
