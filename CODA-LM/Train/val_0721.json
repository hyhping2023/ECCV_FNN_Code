        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two vehicles of interest. Firstly, a grey sedan is located on the left side of the ego vehicle, positioned slightly ahead and traveling in the same direction. It is anticipated that the grey sedan will sustain its current lane and rate of travel. However, vigilance is advised as there is a potential for the sedan to execute lane changes or alter its speed.\n\nSecondly, a heavily loaded truck is situated directly in front of the ego vehicle, conspicuous by the construction equipment it is carrying. Due to the cargo, the truck may be moving at a reduced pace and could engage in unforeseen stops or directional changes. Hence, it is sensible to maintain an increased distance behind this truck for enhanced safety."
