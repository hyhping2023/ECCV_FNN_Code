Firstly, there is a white car parked on the side of the road to the left of the ego car. Although it is not obstructing the ego car's immediate path, it is important to monitor it for any unexpected movements. Ahead of the ego car, in the same lane, there is a grey car. The behavior and speed of this grey car will have a direct impact on the driving decisions of the ego car, such as when to adjust speed and how to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, a cyclist is riding in the same direction. As cyclists are considered vulnerable road users, the ego car must ensure there is a safe distance when overtaking and be prepared for any sudden changes in the cyclist's direction or speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cluster of parked mopeds and motorcycles on the right side of the road. While they are currently stationary, their presence necessitates caution in case any of them start to move into the flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image. These categories can be disregarded in the context of this particular traffic scene."
