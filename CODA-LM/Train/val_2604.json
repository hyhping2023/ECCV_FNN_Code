The ego car must maintain a safe following distance from the bus and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. Additionally, there is a heavy-duty vehicle in the right side lane. The ego car should monitor this vehicle's movements carefully, as it may make lane changes or wide turns.\n\nOn the left side, there is a motorcyclist also traveling in the same direction. The ego car should remain aware of the motorcyclist's position and speed to avoid cutting them off or endangering them with any sudden maneuvers.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a directional sign on the roadside indicating an upcoming intersection. This sign requires the ego car to be ready to make appropriate lane selections and maneuvers depending on the intended route.\n\nLastly, the traffic light visible in the distance is currently green. The ego car should keep an eye on this traffic light and be prepared to stop if it changes to yellow or red as the vehicle approaches the intersection.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
