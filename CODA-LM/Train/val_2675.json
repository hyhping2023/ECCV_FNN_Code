        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two main road users categorized under vehicles. Firstly, there is a large construction vehicle directly in front of the ego car. It occupies the majority of the lane and there's a possibility of debris falling from its rear due to the load of construction materials it's carrying. This presents a risk as the large size and falling debris of the construction vehicle could dictate the driving path of the ego car, necessitating a maintained safe distance.\n\nSecondly, a light-colored truck is seen positioned on the left side, slightly ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The presence and movement of this truck could potentially impact the ego car's ability to change lanes or overtake.\n\nNo other road users or objects such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle equipped with articulated hydraulic arms and a bucket attachment. The heavy construction machine likely contains materials or is being used for road work or a nearby construction project. As a large and potentially slow-moving vehicle, it influences the future driving behavior of the ego car by requiring increased caution and potentially leading to slower traffic flow. The ego car may need to maintain a greater following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or reduced speeds in the vicinity of this vehicle.",

Be cautious of any potential debris falling off that could affect driving conditions. Keep an eye on the light-colored truck to the left as it could influence lane-changing decisions. Regularly check mirrors and blind spots in case a lane change becomes necessary to overtake the construction vehicle when it's safe to do so. Do not attempt to overtake unless the adjacent lane is clear and it is safe to move into it."
