It is displaying a green light. The significance of the green light is that it indicates it's safe for the ego vehicle to proceed, allowing it to continue through the intersection or along the roadway without the need for stopping.\n\nAdditionally, there are bright reflective traffic cones placed on the right side of the driving lane. These cones are creating a taper, which has the effect of narrowing the driving path. The presence of these traffic cones suggests there could be a road hazard or a construction work area approaching. The driver is required to exercise caution in response to this visual cue and prepare to merge left, especially if the driving cones are indicating that the usual driving lane is partially or completely obstructed. \n\nNo other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects have been detected in this traffic image."
