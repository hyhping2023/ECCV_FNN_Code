The presence of this car directly impacts how the ego car should behave, requiring the ego car to be ready to decelerate or halt to prevent a potential collision. Additionally, there are traffic cones placed on the left side of the lane, which suggests roadwork is occurring or a lane is temporarily closed. These cones indicate that it may not be safe to change lanes to the left and that the ego car should stay in its current lane, maintaining a cautious speed due to the possibility of workers on site or other hazards associated with the area demarcated by the traffic cones."

Its presence on the road suggests that there might be roadwork or a construction zone ahead. As a result, the driver of the ego vehicle should remain alert for potential slowdowns, detours, or uneven road surfaces. Caution and reduced speed might be necessary to safely navigate past the construction vehicle, especially if it is actively participating in road work.",

Typically seen in bright orange with a reflective strip for better visibility, these cones are essential for safety in traffic control, particularly near construction zones or accident scenes. The presence of the traffic cone indicates that parts of the lane or road ahead may be blocked or that there are diversions in place.

Traffic cones are generally used to signal to drivers the need to move away from a particular lane or to navigate around a hazard temporarily placed on the road. In this scenario, the placement of the traffic cone suggests it is demarcating a construction zone or a lane closure, prompting the ego car to slow down and change lanes to avoid the area marked by the cones.",
