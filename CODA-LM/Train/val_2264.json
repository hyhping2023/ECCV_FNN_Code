Specifically, there is a car parked on the side of the road to the left. This placed vehicle, while not posing an immediate obstruction, effectively reduces the width of the drivable road for the ego vehicle, necessitating caution and potential adjustments in the pathway.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is present on the right side, close to the roadside's edge. The cyclist appears to be either preparing to start riding or performing some adjustments to the bicycle. This situation suggests that the cyclist might enter the roadway, compelling the ego car to remain alert and be ready to decelerate or come to a halt to avoid a potential collision.\n\nFurthermore, the scene includes barriers along with construction signage positioned to the right, signifying ongoing road work. These barriers may obstruct part of the lane partially, necessitating the ego car to navigate carefully or opt for a lane change if needed to ensure safe passage through the affected area.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned, indicating their absence or irrelevance to the immediate driving conditions and decisions of the ego vehicle."
