Directly in front of the ego car, slightly to the left, there is a white sedan that is stationary. The proximity and position of the sedan require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to stop or take evasive action if necessary. Alongside the ego car, in the right lane, there is a large stationary truck equipped with a crane attachment. The presence of this oversized vehicle is a potential hazard as it can obstruct visibility and add complexity to the driving environment for the ego car. Additionally, there are traffic lights ahead which are currently red for all lanes, indicating that the ego car and other traffic must remain stationary until the lights change to green. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

Due to the wet road conditions, the car should be ready to apply the brakes smoothly and with enough time to prevent skidding. The presence of the large truck on the right should be monitored in case it makes unexpected movements. Overall, the ego car must stay alert for the change of the traffic light to green and be aware of the large truck's potential blind spots when traffic resumes."
