The first vehicle is a large construction truck positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. It is equipped with multiple bright lights and hazard indicators, which suggest that it is either operational or carrying a heavy load. The presence of this construction truck necessitates an increased following distance for the ego vehicle due to its size and the potential to obstruct the view of the road ahead.\n\nThe second vehicle is a cargo truck located in the right lane adjacent to the construction truck. It can be identified by its large container and the red lights at the rear. The cargo truck's position impacts the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes, as it occupies the space to the right.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead displaying a red signal. This red light requires the ego vehicle to stop and remain stationary until the light changes to green, allowing the vehicle to proceed safely.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Typically, this vehicle is used for transporting and potentially mixing construction materials on site. Its presence and function may lead to slow traffic flow as these vehicles tend to operate at lower speeds and may have frequent stops and starts depending on the construction activity.
