This suggests that the vehicle is either slowing down or stopped, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop. Additionally, there is a traffic light showing green, positioned above the road slightly to the right and at a distance from the ego car.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic light displaying a green signal. Traffic lights are critical devices used at intersections to control the flow of traffic. They consist of lights in standard color codes (red, yellow, green) which dictate stop, prepare to stop, and go signals respectively. The green signal illuminates to indicate that vehicles facing the light are allowed to proceed. In this driving scenario, the presence of a green traffic light suggests that the ego car has the right to continue moving forward or initiate any turns permitted at this intersection without the need for stopping, assuming there are no other signs or signals indicating otherwise.",
