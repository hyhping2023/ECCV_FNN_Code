Although these vehicles are not currently moving, their presence narrows the available road space and may potentially block the ego vehicle's line of sight, with the added risk of car doors opening or pedestrians appearing suddenly from between the cars.\n\nAlso present are pedestrians around the road area, with some standing near the crosswalk, while a pedestrian is actively crossing the street at the pedestrian crossing. These individuals pose as variable elements which could affect the ego vehicle's path as those near or on the crosswalk can enter the roadway, and the ego vehicle is required to yield to the person on the crosswalk.\n\nAdditionally, a blue sign indicating a pedestrian crossing is located on the right, further ahead of the ego vehicle. This sign serves as a warning for drivers to remain alert for pedestrians who may be crossing or about to cross the roadway, necessitating increased caution.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the scene, which suggests that these elements either are not present or not significant in this context."
