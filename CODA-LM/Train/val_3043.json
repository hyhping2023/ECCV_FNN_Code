It's important for the ego car to monitor this gap to ensure a safe following distance and to react appropriately if the sedan stops or slows down unexpectedly.\n\nAlso visible is a concrete mixer truck positioned in the next lane to the right of the sedan. The size of the truck could potentially block the ego car's field of vision, and its presence might be indicative of construction activities in the vicinity, suggesting that increased vigilance is required.\n\nA pedestrian is also present on the right side of the road, standing at the curb. Their behavior suggests they could be considering crossing the street, which would require the autonomous system in the ego car to be ready to stop or slow down to avoid any potential accidents.\n\nFurthermore, two traffic lights in the field of view are currently showing red signals. In response to this, the ego car needs to prepare for a full stop according to traffic laws.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that are relevant for navigation at this time."
