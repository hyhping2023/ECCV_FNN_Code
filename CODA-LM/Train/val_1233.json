The visibility of its rear lights indicates that it is moving away from the viewpoint of the ego vehicle. This particular car occupies the lane adjacent to the ego vehicle and is moving in the same direction. This information is crucial for making decisions related to lane changes and speed adjustments, as it directly impacts the driving behavior of the ego vehicle. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene."
