        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there is a significant presence of a vehicle, specifically a red car located on the right side of the ego vehicle. This car is distinct due to its activated brake lights, which suggest that it is either slowing down or coming to a halt. The key implication of this red car's behavior for the autonomous driving system of the ego vehicle is the potential necessity to adjust speed or stop. This adjustment could be required due to various reasons present in the traffic environment such as a traffic signal requiring adherence, a pedestrian crossing that needs to be respected, or an obstacle on the road that must be navigated around. Given the situation, it is imperative for the autonomous driving system of the ego vehicle to closely monitor the actions of this red car, as these actions will directly influence the driving decisions and safety protocols that the ego vehicle must undertake."

Such objects require attention from drivers as they can potentially be blown into the path of vehicles. Objects like garbage on the road may affect visibility or distract drivers and can pose safety risks, particularly at night when visibility is reduced. The ego car should maintain vigilance, possibly slowing down or steering slightly away from the object to avoid contact which may lead to unpredictable vehicle responses or obstructions in the driving path.",
