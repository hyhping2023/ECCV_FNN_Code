Firstly, there is a red truck parked on the right side of the road, which is partially obstructing the driving lane. This situation may necessitate the ego car to change lanes in order to maintain a safe distance from the truck. Additionally, there are several cars parked on both sides of the street. The presence of these parked cars reduces the width of the drivable roadway, which means that the ego car must navigate carefully and may need to perform lane shifts to safely pass through the area.\n\nFurthermore, there is a dog crossing the street. The dog's behavior is unpredictable, and it may change direction or stop abruptly. This poses a potential hazard that requires the ego car to be prepared to slow down or come to a complete stop to avoid a collision.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."
