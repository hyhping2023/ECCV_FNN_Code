There's also a cyclist or someone pushing a cart covered with a blue tarp on the right side, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, who could merge into the traffic lane or become an obstacle.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there's a directional sign indicating the option to turn right or continue straight, which informs drivers of the upcoming road layout. A red traffic light in the distance for the ego vehicle's lane requires it to stop at the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nLastly, there are street vendors or temporary shelters on the right-hand side of the road that could lead to unexpected pedestrian activity or obstructions near the driving path.\n\nNo traffic cones or barriers are present in this image."
