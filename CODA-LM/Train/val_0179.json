        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a black SUV located on the left side, parallel to the ego car. It is positioned in a parking lot or a roadside stop and is stationary. This vehicle poses no immediate risk, but it should be kept under observation as it could potentially join the traffic. On the roads, there are various vehicles moving in the opposite lanes. Notably, these vehicles are not making any maneuvers that would intersect or affect the ego car's path; however, attentiveness to the traffic flow is advised.\n\nAttention must be paid to the road users considered vulnerable. An adult with a stroller is seen crossing the street directly in front of the ego car, accompanied by another pedestrian. As they rightfully have priority, the ego car is obliged to yield until they have completed their crossing in safety. Additional pedestrians are visible on the right side of the crosswalk, crossing the street in the opposite direction to the ego vehicle. These individuals are exercising their right of way, necessitating that the ego car wait until they have completely crossed. Additionally, there is a motorcyclist in the rightmost lane crossing the intersection perpendicularly to the ego car. This necessitates careful observation and potentially yielding, as their travel path intersects with that of the ego car.\n\nAmong the traffic signs, there is a blue circular sign located on the right. This sign mandates a specific direction of traffic flow, possibly indicating a requirement to keep right or proceed through a roundabout. It is important for directing the possible maneuvers of the ego car. With regards to traffic lights, a green signal is observed for the lanes that intersect with the ego car's lane, yet there are no visible signals for the ego vehicle's lane itself. This green light authorizes the cross-traffic's movement, implying that the ego vehicle must remain stationary until it is safe to proceed.\n\nLastly, there are red and white striped barriers or posts on the left side of the frame. They serve the purpose of indicating no entry or lane division, setting clear boundaries for lane usage and directing where the ego car is not permitted to drive for compliant road utilization. Other categories such as traffic cones and other objects do not contain any items in this image and therefore are not relevant to the current traffic scene description."

Once the pedestrian path is clear, and the ego vehicle's traffic signal turns green, proceed with caution, mindful of oncoming traffic and any signals directing through the intersection."
