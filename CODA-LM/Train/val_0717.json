This sedan's presence requires the ego car to regulate its speed and maintain a safe following distance, with preparedness to react to any potential changes in the sedan's movement. Alongside the road, there is a speed limit sign indicating a maximum speed of 30 kilometers per hour, which legally restricts the speed at which the ego car is allowed to travel, likely due to specific conditions such as construction or road safety concerns. However, the traffic lights are not visible in the provided image, which means their state is unknown, and the ego car must proceed while adhering to general traffic rules. Additionally, the road features multiple orange and white traffic cones lined up on the right side, suggesting potential lane narrowing or ongoing road work. The ego car must stay alert to remain within the boundaries of its lane and be cautious of construction workers or unforeseen obstacles. Finally, pink and blue barriers are present along the right side of the road, marking out a construction zone that could lead to possible lane alterations or closures, hence impacting the navigable area available to the ego car."

These barriers are typically bright red or orange for high visibility, making them easily noticeable to drivers. Their primary function is to protect construction zones and ensure the safety of both the workers and the drivers by separating traffic from hazardous areas and guiding vehicles through modified traffic paths. The presence of the barrier indicates that the ego car must remain within the designated lanes and proceed cautiously, adhering to any altered traffic flow or reduced speed limits.",
