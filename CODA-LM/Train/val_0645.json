On the road, there are multiple vehicles, including sedans and a more noticeable white van further ahead in the right lane. These vehicles are in the same direction as the ego car, which should stay alert for potential changes in speed or lane changes from these vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic sign indicating the approach of a roundabout is visible. This round sign with blue background and white arrows is situated on the right side of the road. This alerts the ego car to the upcoming roundabout, suggesting that the driver should reduce speed and be more vigilant of the merging traffic and yield rules that apply.\n\nFurthermore, there are orange traffic cones lined up on the right side of the rightmost lane, starting near the ego car and extending into the distance. These cones signify that there may be road hazards or a construction area ahead, advising the ego car to consider changing lanes if the path is obstructed.\n\nTo complete the road safety features, there are metal guardrails installed on both sides of the road. These barriers serve to demarcate the road boundaries and prevent vehicles from driving off the road. They signal that the ego car should keep a safe position within the lane while traveling."
