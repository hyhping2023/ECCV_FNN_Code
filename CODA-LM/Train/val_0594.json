        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several key elements affecting the driving behavior of the ego vehicle:\n\nVehicles: A blue bus is positioned on the right side of the ego vehicle, moving in the same direction. The presence of the bus should be noted, as it may engage in frequent stops for passengers, potentially affecting the flow of traffic. Ahead of the ego vehicle is a silver sedan, also traveling in the same direction. The ego vehicle needs to maintain a safe following distance from the sedan in ordinary traffic conditions.\n\nVulnerable Road Users: On the sidewalk to the right, pedestrians are visible, which requires monitoring by the ego vehicle due to their unpredictability. Additionally, there is a person wearing a reflective vest standing in the traffic lane on the right side. This individual could be a traffic enforcer or construction worker, capable of issuing directions or signals that might influence traffic flow.\n\nTraffic Cones: A line of orange traffic cones exists, marking the boundary of the rightmost lane and segregating it from the remaining lanes. These begin in the foreground and extend into the distance, signaling that the right lane is closed, which could be due to construction or an event. This narrowing of available lanes alters the drivable area for the ego vehicle.\n\nThere are no mentioned traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in this summary, as their categories were not listed with corresponding items in the provided JSON data."

Traffic cones are typically colored in highly visible shades such as orange, as shown in the image, with a reflective strip to ensure they are easily noticeable even in low light. Their influence on future driving behavior includes alerting the driver of the ego car to potential hazards or changes in road layout ahead, promoting slower speeds and more cautious driving through the marked zone.",
