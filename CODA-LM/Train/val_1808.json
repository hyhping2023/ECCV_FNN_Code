The first vehicle is a yellow van located to the left of the image, which is in motion and likely traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the yellow van indicates that the ego car might be in the process of overtaking or being overtaken, which would influence the driver's decision regarding lane choice and speed adjustments.\n\nThe second vehicle is a red and orange barrier truck positioned towards the right side of the image. It is also in motion and appears to be in a separate lane that is designated for works or emergency use. The barrier truck suggests that there may be road works or a lane closure ahead, and as a result, the ego car may need to change lanes or reduce speed to safely navigate the area.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of connected red and white barriers on the far right of the image. These barriers serve as a division between the driving lane and a restricted or construction area. They indicate that the ego car must maintain proper lane discipline and stay alert for any potential obstacles or workers that may be in close proximity to the roadway.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
