        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene visualized, there are a couple of notable elements that impact the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle.\n\nFirstly, there is a red car parked on the right side of the road, facing towards the ego car. The presence of this parked car is significant as it reduces the drivable width of the roadway. This situation could compel other drivers to shift into the lane of the ego car to steer clear of the parked vehicle, thus requiring heightened vigilance and potential maneuvering to maintain safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, a heavy vehicle is present on the same road and is positioned in front of the ego car, moving away from it. This vehicle is transporting a large piece of machinery. Due to its size and load, it is likely to travel at a lower speed compared to the general traffic flow. Consequently, the ego car needs to maintain a substantial following distance for safety reasons. If necessary and safe to do so, the ego car might also have to execute a lane change to overtake the heavy vehicle.\n\nThere's a traffic light observed in the distance which is green at the moment. The green light signifies that it is acceptable for the ego car to continue moving forward. Nevertheless, it is essential for the ego car to remain alert and prepared to come to a halt should the traffic light switch to a different color.\n\nThe scene does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects. Thus, those categories don't influence the driving behavior in the current situation."
