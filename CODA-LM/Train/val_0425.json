This box, often found near gates or at the entrances of secured locations, can influence the driving scenario by indicating a controlled access area where drivers might expect sudden stops or interactions with security personnel.

Additionally, prepare to adjust speed for the indicated right-hand bend ahead, and continue to monitor the roadway for any changes in traffic conditions or unexpected hazards."
