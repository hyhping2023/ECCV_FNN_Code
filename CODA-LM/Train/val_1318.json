Additionally, a traffic light is visible slightly left of the center in the middle distance, although the lights themselves are not visible in the image. It is important to approach this traffic light with caution until its state can be clearly observed, particularly if it regulates the intersection the ego car is nearing.\n\nFurthermore, multiple reflective traffic cones are placed in front of a crosswalk on the ego car's right side, parallel to the road lane. These cones signal a potential hazard or roadwork, necessitating diversions or lane restrictions. Also, white metal barriers flank the protected area to the right of the road, delineating segments of the sidewalk and road possibly for pedestrian safety or construction purposes, indicating that vehicles should not traverse into the barricaded zone."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used for traffic management. It is designed to be highly visible, often colored in bright orange with a reflective strip. Traffic cones are commonly placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner around construction sites, accidents, or other road disruptions. In this scenario, the cone's placement is crucial for the ego car to recognize a potential hazard or a change in the usual traffic pattern, indicating to the driver to proceed with caution or to adjust the driving path.",

The primary purpose of a bollard is to control or direct road traffic, preventing access to certain areas while allowing pedestrians and bicycles to pass through. Bollards can be made from various materials including metal, concrete, or plastic and are often used to secure restricted areas, protect buildings and pedestrians from vehicles, or provide visual barriers on roads. In the context of driving, it alerts the driver of the ego car to not cross into the areas protected by the bollards, thereby influencing the vehicles route navigation.",
