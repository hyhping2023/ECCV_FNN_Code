        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of vehicles of interest. The first is a white vehicle that is only partially visible on the left side of the road; it's parked by the curb behind some foliage. Although this vehicle is stationary and doesn't pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle's movement, it is important to keep it in mind as its status could change. Additionally, there is a blue car traveling on the opposite lane towards the ego vehicle. This car is maintaining its lane and does not currently interfere with the path of the ego vehicle. However, the ego vehicle should continue to monitor this car's behavior.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights are identified in this particular scene.\n\nThere are yellow and black traffic cones placed along the side of the road, starting from where the ego vehicle is and extending into the distance. These cones could indicate a construction zone or a road hazard, and it is essential for the ego vehicle to stay clear of this area to avoid any damage or potential accidents.\n\nLastly, there is notable green foliage and trees flanking both sides of the road. This environment raises the level of caution needed as the dense greenery may conceal hazards such as pedestrians or animals that are not directly visible from the road. Thus, the ego vehicle should exercise increased vigilance."

Watch for any sudden movements or obstructions from areas with limited visibility due to foliage."
