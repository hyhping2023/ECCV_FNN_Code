This placement of the vehicle suggests a potential temporary halt or an emergency situation, demanding cautious navigation from the ego car as it might directly affect its intended path. Furthermore, there is a pedestrian situated close to the passenger door of the white sedan, seemingly engaging with someone inside the car. The close proximity of the pedestrian to the vehicle raises concerns about the possibility of them stepping onto the roadway unexpectedly, which would necessitate a high degree of vigilance and readiness to stop from the ego car to avoid any hazardous situation. Additionally, the image lacks visibility of the traffic lights, which introduces an element of uncertainty. Due to the unobservable traffic light, the ego car is advised to approach the intersection with enhanced caution, prepared to adapt its behavior based on the traffic light status once it becomes visible, despite the absence of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects in the image."

If the traffic light (which is not visible in the image) is green and it is safe to proceed, the ego car should pass the white sedan with ample clearance to avoid endangering the pedestrian. If the traffic light is red, the car should come to a complete stop at the signal and wait for the appropriate signal to proceed safely, giving way to any pedestrians in the crossing."
