On the left side of the ego car, there is a heavy truck transporting construction equipment, which is visible through the driver's side window. The heavy load of this truck may cause it to move slower, potentially affecting the speed and lane choice of the ego car. Additionally, on the right side of the ego car, there is a construction vehicle with a large wheel, also traveling in the same direction. The size of this vehicle could limit the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right.\n\nFurthermore, yellow traffic cones are set up in a line on the right-hand side of the road. These cones suggest that a section of the road might be closed or under construction, which could mean that the ego car needs to merge left to continue safely, as the lane width may be reduced or there might be a road hazard or construction zone ahead.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

This type of vehicle is typically used in construction projects for tasks such as moving or loading materials like asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, snow, feed, gravel, logs, raw minerals, recycled material, rock, sand, woodchips, etc. Its presence in the driving scenario suggests that construction work may be ongoing nearby, potentially leading to the presence of construction debris on the road or the vehicle making sudden stops or maneuvers. The ego car should maintain a safe distance, reduce speed, and be alert for sudden movements or obstacles related to construction activity.",
