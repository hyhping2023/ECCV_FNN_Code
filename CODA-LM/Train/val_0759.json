However, a motorcyclist is present directly ahead of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. It is crucial for the ego car to keep a safe following distance and remain vigilant to any potential abrupt movements or stops the motorcyclist may make.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on a barrier to the right side of the road that displays red and white prohibition markings. This sign could signify a 'no entry' or 'no parking' restriction. The exact meaning is not clear, but it implies there are certain limitations that the ego car must acknowledge, possibly influencing the lane selection or alerting to conditions further along the road.\n\nFurthermore, a long green barrier is positioned along the right-hand side of the roadway. This barrier delineates the driving lane from the other side, restricting the rightward movements of the ego car and indicating that the vehicle should stay in the current driving lane without making any right turns."
