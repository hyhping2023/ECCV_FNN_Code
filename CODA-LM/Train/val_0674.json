The size and proximity of the truck could affect lane change decisions for the ego car, and there is a need to maintain a safe following distance due to the truck's presence.\n\nAdditionally, there are yellow and black traffic cones arranged in a line, which separate the active traffic lanes from a closed-off area to the right of the road. The presence of these traffic cones indicates that there might be road works ahead or a section of the road that is not in use. This setup influences the drivable paths available to the ego car, as it must navigate around the cones without entering the closed-off area.\n\nAlso present in the scene are red and white barriers on the right-hand side of the road. These barriers indicate a section of the highway that has been closed off. Consequently, they restrict the lane accessibility for the ego car, effectively limiting the potential for any lane changes to the right.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects in the scene that need to be considered in this description."

Continue in the current lane, adhering to the lane marking and following traffic laws until it is safe and legal to overtake the truck, if needed and desired."
