            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It is recognizable by its large cylindrical drum used for mixing cement, which is mounted on the truck's chassis. This kind of vehicle is critical in construction projects for transporting and mixing cement on the site. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road indicates potential nearby construction activity. For the ego car, this implies the need for increased caution and awareness. Construction vehicles typically move slower and may make sudden stops or maneuvers. Therefore, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected movements from the construction vehicle.",
