There is a green car ahead in the same lane, facing away from the ego vehicle, necessitating the ego car to adjust its speed and following distance to maintain safety. Additionally, several other cars are present in the opposite lane, facing towards the ego vehicle; these vehicles require monitoring to anticipate their actions, especially potential turns.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist ahead on the right-hand side moving in the same direction as the ego car. This necessitates cautious driving due to the cyclist's potential to change direction or speed. There are also pedestrians on both sides of the road who may step into the street, making it essential for the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign on the right-hand side indicates the presence of a pedestrian crosswalk ahead, prompting the ego car to be ready to yield to pedestrians. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Mopeds, being smaller and sometimes unpredictable in their movements, require drivers to exercise caution when navigating near them. In this driving scenario, the presence of the moped indicates that the driver must be wary of the possibility that the moped could pull out into the street suddenly. This awareness is crucial as it influences the driver to maintain a safe distance and reduce speed when passing by parked mopeds to anticipate potential sudden movements.",
