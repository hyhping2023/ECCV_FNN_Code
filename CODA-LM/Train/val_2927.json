        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there are two prominent features that influence driving behavior. Firstly, a pedestrian crossing sign is noticeable on the right side of the road. This sign serves as a caution for the ego car, indicating the potential presence of pedestrians attempting to cross the road ahead, and suggests that the vehicle should proceed with heightened awareness and caution. Secondly, a barrier is situated ahead on the left side of the road, partially obstructing the lane. This necessitates the ego car to adjust its trajectory slightly towards the right to circumvent the barrier safely, ensuring an unobstructed passage. No vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this scene, making the pedestrian crossing sign and the barrier the main focus for navigating the area safely."

It is usually bright orange and made of a lightweight, durable plastic with a reflective strip to increase visibility. Its presence suggests there might be potential hazards or alterations in the usual traffic pattern ahead, signaling the driver of the ego car to proceed with caution and possibly reduce speed.",
