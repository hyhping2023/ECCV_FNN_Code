The ego car must observe this sign to stay oriented and prepare for any required lane changes or exits if following a specific route.\n\nTraffic lights are also visible, with the farthest set showing a red signal. The ego vehicle needs to be prepared to stop at the traffic signal or reduce speed as it approaches the intersection.\n\nThere is a line of traffic cones on the right side of the road, indicating a closed lane or area.

It is used to redirect traffic or mark areas where driving is not permitted.

Lane keeping should be a priority due to the presence of traffic cones marking the borders of the usable roadway. Additionally, the wet road conditions necessitate a cautious approach to braking and turning. Keep an eye on the directional sign to ensure correct navigation if the path of the ego car is predetermined. Lastly, no lane changes should be made to the right where the traffic cones are positioned."
