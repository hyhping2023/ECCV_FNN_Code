This truck occupies most of the road width and has visible identification marks along with a phone number on the back. The presence of this truck is significant because it is traveling in the same direction as the ego car and could potentially slow down, stop abruptly, or make turns. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to any sudden actions taken by the truck."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large commercial vehicle, specifically a truck, characterized by its rectangular cargo area and visible shipping container numbers. The presence of this truck directly in front of the ego car influences driving behavior significantly. The size and slower acceleration and deceleration speed of the truck mean the ego car should maintain a greater following distance to allow ample time for safe braking and reaction to any sudden movements or stops the truck may make. This ensures safety and prevents collisions, especially in situations where the truck may stop unexpectedly or when the visibility is low, as observed here due to night conditions.",

Drive at a reduced speed to compensate for limited visibility and potential hazards that may not be visible due to nighttime conditions. Stay vigilant for any additional road users or changes in traffic conditions that may not be immediately visible in the current view."
