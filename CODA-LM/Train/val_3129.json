The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this sedan to prevent any potential collisions.\n\nTo the right, ahead of the ego car, there's a white SUV also traveling in the same direction. The ego vehicle must stay aware of this SUV because it might slow down, change lanes, or turn at intersections, requiring the ego car to be ready to respond accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a parked bicycle near a construction vehicle on the curbside. While it is stationary, the potential for a pedestrian to start using the bicycle means the ego car must remain vigilant for any such changes as the bicycle could become a moving obstacle.\n\nLastly, there are white barriers or curbstones positioned on the right side of the road. These barriers separate the driving lane from the sidewalk and serve as fixed obstacles that define the driving path. They limit where the vehicle can drive, reducing the available space for maneuvering and signaling to the autonomous car where not to drive.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or any other objects reported in the image that would affect the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
