Vehicles include a yellow-green car traveling on the left side, paralleling the ego vehicle's direction, which requires monitoring although their paths don't currently intersect. Additionally, there are large orange tank trucks parked on the right side of the road, which narrows the drivable area, possibly necessitating a lane change or speed adjustment by the ego vehicle.\n\nThere are directional signs overhead, indicating proper lane usage and upcoming locations to support navigation. The visibility of other roadside signage is compromised due to the photo angle and resolution, which mandates increased attentiveness from the autonomous driving system for any consequential guidance or restrictions.\n\nThe traffic lights observed include a red one in the distance on the left, indicating a potential stop if nearing an intersection. The nearest light's status is indeterminate, which is critical information for correct driving decisions and thus must be verified.\n\nFinally, orange traffic cones are present on the right side of the road, establishing the boundary for either a construction or a parked vehicles zone. These cones inform the ego vehicle that there's a restricted area ahead, advising it to maintain lane and possibly reduce speed when passing by the designated zone.\n\nThis summary encompasses all the discernible traffic elements that are pertinent to the ego vehicle's driving decisions."

The cones are bright and visible, designed to draw attention and direct traffic away from specific areas for safety. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone indicates some form of temporary obstruction or potential hazard on the road ahead.

These cones are usually bright orange with a reflective stripe to ensure high visibility, making them effective tools for guiding drivers and reducing the risk of accidents. The presence of the cone suggests that part of the road may be blocked or there could be construction activities ahead.
