        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the ego car is surrounded by a variety of road users and objects. To the left of the ego car, there is a white SUV in an adjacent lane and slightly ahead. It's important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and to remain vigilant of any possible lane changes that the SUV might execute. Directly in front of the ego car, in the same lane, several cars are visible, with distances between them varying. The closest is a white car, followed by a darker vehicle further away. These cars will dictate the traveling speed and following distance required by the ego car, which needs to stay alert and ready to adjust its speed accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there are directional signs overhead, including a 'no entry' sign for the far right lane under the overpass, which informs the ego car about lane usage and nearby road restrictions. On the right side of the road, a line of orange and white traffic cones begins near the ego car and stretches forward, indicating a construction zone or lane closure. Consequently, the ego car is advised to keep away from the closed lane and stay attentive to possible workers or equipment in the vicinity.\n\nLastly, there are bicycles parked on the right side of the road, just beyond the row of traffic cones. While these bicycles are not on the move and are therefore not an immediate hazard, their presence could indicate the possibility of cyclists entering the roadway. This requires the ego car to exercise increased caution for any cyclists that may merge into traffic."

It is often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or after accidents, and it signifies that the driver should stay clear of that particular area for safety.
