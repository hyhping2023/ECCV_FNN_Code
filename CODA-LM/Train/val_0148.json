A white sedan directly ahead, maintaining its lane position with significant space between it and the ego vehicle. This car's potential to slow down or change lanes may impact the ego car's speed and lane decisions.\n2. A black SUV in the left lane, parallel to the ego vehicle and slightly ahead. This SUV could change lanes, potentially cutting in front of the ego vehicle, necessitating quick adjustments in speed or lane position.\n3. Vehicles in the opposing traffic lanes, moving away from the ego vehicle. Although they do not have an immediate impact, they should be monitored in case one crosses the median.\n\nThere is also a group of cyclists to the right of the intersection traveling perpendicular to the ego vehicle's path. These cyclists might enter the ego vehicle's travel path, requiring vigilance and readiness to stop if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light for the ego vehicle's direction of travel is green, indicating the right-of-way through the intersection.\n\nLastly, red and white traffic cones are observed on the right side of the road, narrowing the driving lane and suggesting potential road work or hazards. This requires the ego vehicle to maintain lane discipline and possibly reduce speed."

The purpose of a bollard in this context is likely to serve as a visual and physical barrier to vehicles, indicating areas not intended for vehicular traffic, such as pedestrian zones or to protect vulnerable areas like building entrances. As for its influence on the ego car's driving behavior, the bollard should be recognized as an obstacle to stay clear of, ensuring the ego car does not veer off the roadway or into restricted areas. The driver should maintain lane discipline and be mindful of the separation between the roadway for vehicles and protected areas designated for pedestrians or other non-vehicular use.",
