A silver sedan is positioned directly ahead, sharing the same lane and heading in the same direction. The following distance and speed of our autonomous vehicle (ego car) are influenced by this car, as well as any decision-making regarding lane changes.\n2. There is a white car to the front left side, in a neighboring lane. It moves parallel to the ego car's direction. Our vehicle needs to keep an eye on this car for possible lane shifts or merges.\n3. To the right, there's a red bus, halted and aligned with the sidewalk, facing the same way as the ego car. The bus might merge into traffic, so the ego car should be ready to respond, potentially changing lanes or adjusting speed.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. Pedestrians are observed on the right-hand sidewalk, some of whom are close to the curb, walking in parallel to the road's direction. Pedestrians near the road pose a risk of stepping onto the road unexpectedly, which would require immediate reaction from the ego car to ensure safety.\n2. Cyclists are riding within the designated bicycle lane on the right-hand side, sharing the direction of vehicle traffic. They have an impact on the lateral space available to the ego car, and there is a risk they might enter the vehicle lane, suggesting that a safe distance should be maintained.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. Directional signage is installed above the roadway towards the right. These signs are significant for the ego car, as they convey information on imminent junctions or alterations in road layout, which helps the vehicle to plan its lane usage and turning movements in advance.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n1. A traffic light is present on the right-hand side, currently displaying red. This compels the ego car to stop at the intersection and wait for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the traffic image, indicating that they are not present or relevant in this context."
