Its intricate design suggests that it is not merely functional but also intended to be visually appealing, enhancing the aesthetic of the environment. For the ego car, this object does not impose any immediate impact on driving behavior as it is stationary and located well out of the roadway. Its presence is merely visual and should not require any driving adjustments or considerations.",
