        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a variety of elements that are pertinent to the autonomous vehicle's navigation:\n\n- A forklift is located across the ego vehicle's path on the right side of the road. Positioned perpendicularly with its forks facing the road, it partly blocks the right-hand side. This forklift represents a potential risk, as it might move into or obstruct the lane, demanding that the ego vehicle be ready to decelerate or come to a halt.\n\n- On the left side of the road, several cars are parked in alignment with the travel way. These vehicles limit the usable width of the roadway and bring about the additional unpredictability of doors being opened or pedestrians appearing suddenly from between the cars.\n\n- An overhead traffic sign structure is noticeable; however, it currently lacks any attached signboards. Although not providing any immediate information, it's still essential to keep an eye on this structure since there could be traffic signs on the opposite side or signs may be installed later on.\n\nNo other road users such as vulnerable ones (like pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists), traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are present in this image as indicated by the absence of entries in these categories in the JSON data."
