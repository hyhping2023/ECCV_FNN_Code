The presence of the parked truck is significant as it occupies part of the shoulder, which could be used by the ego car in case of safety reasons or emergency maneuvers. Drivers should exercise caution around the truck as there might be unseen activities occurring near it.\n\nAdditionally, reflective hazard signs are present on the barriers to the right of the ego car. These signs indicate that there may be roadworks or changes in the road layout ahead, alerting the driver to potential hazards. As a result, the driver should reduce speed and pay extra attention to the road.\n\nConcrete barriers with reflective strips are also placed on the right side of the road, clearly marking the edge of the road. These barriers serve to indicate the boundaries of the driving area and prevent access to any potential hazards or construction zones. The ego car must navigate within the available lane space to the left of these barriers to ensure safety.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."
