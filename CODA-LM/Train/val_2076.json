It is positioned diagonally across the lane, with its front end facing the verge. The truck is partially obstructing the lane that the ego car is traveling in. The presence of the truck could indicate that it is either making a turn or has come to a stop. This situation presents a potential risk of collision for the ego car, which will need to take evasive action to avoid an accident. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

It is crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle due to potential debris fall-off from the mixing drum and the possibility of sudden stops or turns made by the heavy vehicle. The ego car should also be prepared for wider turns made by the truck, which could affect neighboring lanes.",
