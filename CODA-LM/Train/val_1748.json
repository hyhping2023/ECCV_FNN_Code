This vehicle influences the ego vehicle's speed and following distance due to its presence and movement. Additionally, a small animal, likely a dog, is crossing the road from left to right ahead of the ego vehicle, representing an unpredictable hazard that necessitates the ego vehicle to reduce speed or stop to avoid a collision. On the left side of the road, there is a large red banner with white Chinese characters, which may distract drivers or obscure other road users or signs despite its content not being related to traffic regulations."

Simultaneously, maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead and be cautious of potential distractions from the large banner. Be attentive for any other road users that may be obscured or any instructions from traffic signs that are not visible in the image."
