On the left side of the ego car, there is a white car waiting at the intersection, which requires the ego car to watch for its turn signals and wheels to determine its intentions and ensure the right of way is respected to prevent a collision. In front of the white car, slightly to the right and facing the ego car from the opposite side of the intersection, is a commercial truck painted in white. The ego car needs to wait for this truck to pass through the intersection to maintain a safe following distance and avoid accidents.\n\nOn the right side, a cement mixer truck is facing away from the ego car, suggesting it may be involved in nearby construction work. This indicates that there might be construction activity affecting traffic patterns, necessitating reduced speeds and heightened caution. Also on the right, in the foreground, is a tipper truck with its back towards the ego car, which could be moving away from or is stationary near a construction site. The ego car should keep a safe distance and be ready for unexpected movements such as sudden stops or the truck reversing.\n\nNear the central area of the intersection, on the opposite side of the ego car, there is a group of motorcyclists and possibly pedestrians. Their presence means there is a potential for unpredictable movements, and the ego car must be ready to stop or yield to ensure their safety.\n\nThe traffic light in the top center of the image is displaying green for the direction of the ego car, signaling the right to proceed. However, the ego car must still approach the intersection with caution, considering the other road users and their potential actions.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
