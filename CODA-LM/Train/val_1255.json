Starting with the vehicles, there is a silver sedan in the right lane moving in the same direction as the ego car. The relative speed and trajectory of the silver sedan are important as they will influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes and speed adjustments. Additionally, there is a white vehicle slightly ahead of the ego car, positioned in the center-left of the image. This white vehicle has its hazard lights on, which may indicate that it is slowing down or has come to a stop. Consequently, the ego car must remain alert and may need to adjust its speed.\n\nRegarding traffic cones, there is a row of orange cones set up to direct the flow of traffic away from the right side of the road. These cones likely point to a road obstruction or construction area, thus affecting the lane choice for the ego car as it will need to navigate around this obstacle.\n\nIn this image, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects identified that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
