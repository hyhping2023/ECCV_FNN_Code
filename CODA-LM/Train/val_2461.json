The pedestrians are on the right side of the road, walking in the same direction as the autonomous vehicle, known as the ego vehicle. Due to their proximity to the road, there is a possibility they may affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, which should be prepared to maintain a safe distance and modulate its speed to ensure their safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on the left, which has an arrow pointing upwards. This sign indicates that there is a direction to follow or possibly a detour ahead. Therefore, the ego vehicle should be ready to adjust its route accordingly, which might involve changing direction or switching lanes in anticipation of the upcoming road changes.\n\nThe image does not contain any other categories such as vehicles, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects."
