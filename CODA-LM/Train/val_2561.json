This vehicle's position and size severely restrict the available lanes for travel, requiring other vehicles to navigate around it carefully. Additionally, multiple traffic cones are placed to the right of the crane vehicle, delineating a boundary that indicates a lane closure or road work ahead. These cones signal a change in traffic patterns and guide vehicles to stay in the correct lane, away from potential hazards.
