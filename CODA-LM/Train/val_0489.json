The presence and behavior of this vehicle are crucial as they will directly influence the ego car's speed and following distance. To the right of the road, there are rows of parked bicycles; however, there are no pedestrians or cyclists currently using the road. Although the parked bicycles do not pose an immediate hazard, the ego car should remain vigilant in case cyclists approach the bicycle parking area. Additionally, the traffic light ahead is green, which means the ego vehicle is permitted to proceed. Nevertheless, the ego car should stay alert for any potential changes in the traffic light signal and be prepared to respond to the actions of the vehicle ahead. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
