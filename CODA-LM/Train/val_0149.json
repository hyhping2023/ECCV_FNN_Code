        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, several key elements and road users are identified. There is a black car parked on the right shoulder of the road, overlapping the sidewalk space. This poses a potential risk as the vehicle could become an obstacle if it moves suddenly or if someone opens a car door, so the ego vehicle must stay alert and maintain a safe distance while passing by.\n\nAlong the road, there is a set of traffic signs. A blue circular sign signals a mandatory turn to the left, which the ego vehicle should get ready to follow. Additionally, there's a cluster of signs on a pole including a no parking sign, which prohibits stopping on certain parts of the road, a speed limit indicating a maximum of 40 km/h, and directional arrows that could aid the ego vehicle in choosing the correct lane for its intended path.\n\nThe traffic lights present in the scene are unlit, which could imply a temporary issue or a malfunction. In this case, the ego vehicle has to approach the intersection with extra caution, prepared to comply with manual signals or obey alternative directions from road signage or traffic officers.\n\nTo the left side of the road, there are orange and white traffic cones lined up, serving as a visual guide steering vehicles away from the sidewalk. These cones suggest the possibility of ongoing road work or a hazard nearby, so the ego vehicle must reduce speed and be particularly attentive in that area.\n\nFinally, there is a barrier with horizontal stripes near the parked car, indicating a section of the road that may be closed or pose a hazard. The ego vehicle should acknowledge this barrier and refrain from crossing or entering the demarcated area."
