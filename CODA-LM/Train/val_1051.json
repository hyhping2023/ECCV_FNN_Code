        "description and explanation": "In the image, there are two vehicles present. Firstly, there is a large tow truck with a crane, primarily white and green in color. It is located on the left lane of a two-lane road and is traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The size of the tow truck and its potential slow pace are particular factors as they could influence the flow of traffic; thus, the autonomous vehicle may need to switch lanes to pass it.\n\nFurthermore, a blue truck is visible in the distance on the same lane ahead of the tow truck, again moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The blue truck's presence suggests that traffic in that lane is in motion, but it could be at a slower rate due to the dimensions of both vehicles. This circumstance may affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, requiring it to adjust its driving strategy accordingly."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a truck carrying a large crane. The presence of such a vehicle indicates nearby construction work or the transportation of heavy machinery required for construction projects. For the ego car, the presence of this type of vehicle typically demands increased caution. The driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or sudden stops. Additionally, the size and extended parts of the crane might restrict the visible area or lane availability for the ego car, necessitating heightened awareness and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes if safe and necessary.",

It is important to monitor the truck's signals and speed to determine the best moment to overtake safely, especially considering the presence of the blue truck further ahead. The ego car should also adhere to speed limits and be prepared to adjust speed according to the flow of traffic. Lastly, continuously observe the road for any new developments or road users entering the scene."
