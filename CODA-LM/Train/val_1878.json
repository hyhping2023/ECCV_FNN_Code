        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are no vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present. However, there are vulnerable road users and other objects of interest. Specifically, two individuals are standing next to large spools of cable on the sidewalk to the right side of the road. These individuals do not currently obstruct the roadway, but given their proximity, there is a risk that they could step onto the road. This possibility requires the ego vehicle to monitor the situation carefully, as their potential movement onto the road could affect traffic flow and safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are objects on the sidewalk including large spools of cable and a trash bin near where the individuals are located. These items are stationary and situated off the road. Their presence, however, indicates that there may be work area activity nearby, which is another factor the ego vehicle should consider carefully while navigating to ensure the safety of all road users and to adjust to any changes in the driving environment."
