The traffic cones are bright orange and white-striped, arranged in a line along the curb of the rightmost lane, encroaching slightly into the lane. They serve as an indication of a possibly closed section of the road or sidewalk due to construction, maintenance, or other activities. The car will need to adjust its path slightly to the left to ensure a safe distance from the cones.\n\nAdditionally, a large, temporary, tent-like structure with grey canvas walls is situated on the sidewalk on the right side of the road, close to the curb. This structure likely represents an area of roadside activity, which could be construction or a temporary installation. The proximity of this structure to the road requires the car to be extra vigilant as it passes, to be prepared for any potential unexpected incursions into the road that could pose a hazard."
