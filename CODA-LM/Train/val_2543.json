This sign is important as it alerts the ego car to the upcoming change in the road's direction, necessitating a possible adjustment in speed and preparation for navigating the curve.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple bright orange and white traffic cones arranged in a row that tapers into the left lane. These cones are there to signal that there are roadworks or obstacles ahead, and as a result, the ego car must merge into the right lane to continue safely and avoid the restricted area.\n\nFurthermore, metal barriers are positioned on the left side of the ego car. These barriers are likely there to indicate a separation from a drop-off or a construction area beside the road. They serve to delineate the work zone and protected area, clearly indicating that the ego vehicle should maintain its position to the right to ensure safety.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
