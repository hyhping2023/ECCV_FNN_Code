Firstly, there is a red vehicle with an open trunk moving in the same direction as the ego car, positioned to the left side of the lane. This vehicle's erratic appearance and open trunk suggest unpredictability, indicating it may make sudden stops or changes in movement.\n\nSecondly, there is a dog crossing the road in front of the ego car. The presence of the dog introduces an unpredictable element as it may change direction or stop suddenly, posing a potential hazard.\n\nAdditionally, red and white traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, signifying a closed lane or an area to avoid. These cones likely indicate road work, an obstruction, or another road condition necessitating vehicles to merge left.\n\nAlongside the traffic cones, there is a yellow and black striped barrier on the side of the road. This barrier presumably delimits the same closed area or construction zone marked by the traffic cones."
