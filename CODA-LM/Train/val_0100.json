There's a blue bus positioned on the opposite side of the intersection, which appears to be stationary while it loads or unloads passengers. The presence of the bus is significant since its potential movement could impact the flow of traffic around it.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars in adjacent lanes both to the left and right of the ego vehicle, all of which also seem to be stationary due to the traffic control signals. The movements of these cars are critical to consider since they share the road space, and their actions will determine when it is safe for the ego vehicle to move forward.\n\nThe scene also includes vulnerable road users. A cyclist is noted to the far left, moving across the intersection, crossing from where the ego vehicle is positioned. The movement path of the cyclist might intersect with that of the ego vehicle, which is an important consideration for the vehicle's navigational decisions. Furthermore, pedestrians are seen crossing the road in front of the ego vehicle, including one with a motorbike or scooter cart, carrying a load. It is important for the ego vehicle to yield to these pedestrians as they have the right of way and the vehicle must wait until the crosswalk is clear before proceeding.\n\nFrom the point of view of the ego vehicle, a red traffic light is visible which mandates that the vehicle remains stationary until the light turns green.\n\nOn the side of the road to the right, there are red and white traffic posts that may indicate a closed or restricted lane which could affect lane choice or indicate a potential obstruction as the ego vehicle moves forward.\n\nThe JSON data does not list any traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in this traffic image, implying that these categories do not contain relevant information or road users for the described scenario."
