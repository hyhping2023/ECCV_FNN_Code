Although the parked car doesn't pose an immediate threat, the ego car should still proceed with caution when passing or maneuvering around it. In addition, a large green construction vehicle with an extended arm is present on the road. This construction vehicle is obstructing part of the road, which may impede the ego car's movement, therefore caution and potential lane changes are necessary to navigate safely past it.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, two pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk near the construction vehicle. It is important for the ego car to be mindful of potential pedestrian crossings and to adjust its speed accordingly to ensure safety.\n\nLastly, in the distance, there is a red traffic light. This indicates that the ego car should be prepared to stop at the upcoming intersection. Other categories like traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not have any entries in this image and can thus be disregarded."

The truck features a rotating drum used to mix cement, which is crucial for delivering mixed concrete to construction sites. The rough condition and bulky size of the mixer indicate that it might maneuver slowly and make wide turns. For the ego car, maintaining a safe distance and being cautious of slow movements or sudden stops from this truck is advisable to ensure safe driving.",
