It's positioned at an angle, projecting into the roadway. This presents a potential hazard for the ego car, which may need to reduce speed or change lanes to avoid a collision, as the vehicle is partially obstructing the right lane.\n\nFurther ahead, the tail lights of several vehicles can be seen. They are moving away from the ego car's location. To ensure safety, the ego car will have to keep an eye on these vehicles, monitoring their speed and braking activity to adjust its own speed and maintain an appropriate following distance.\n\nOn the roadside, at least two pedestrians are visible. One is notably walking and carrying a reflective bag. Given their proximity to the road, especially during times of low visibility, there is an increased risk of an accident. Therefore, the ego car must be ready to stop or yield as necessary to guarantee the safety of the pedestrians.\n\nIn terms of road signs, a directional sign is positioned on the left, indicating routes to various destinations, and it includes an attached 'no right turn' sign. The ego car must heed the information provided by these signs, adhering to the specified directions and recognizing that a right turn at this junction is not allowed.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving conditions for the ego car."
