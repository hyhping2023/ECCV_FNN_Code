It occupies the right lane and is partially encroaching upon the left lane where the ego vehicle is. This construction vehicle is obstructing part of the left lane and poses a potential hazard if the ego vehicle attempts to pass it without sufficient clearance.\n\nSecondly, a heavy red truck is ahead of the construction vehicle, traveling in the same direction. Its presence indicates that passing on the right may not be possible and that the ego vehicle should assess the speed and trajectory before deciding to maneuver around.\n\nLastly, there is a green emergency service vehicle in front of the heavy red truck with visible rear lights, suggesting it might be slowing down or stopping. Given its function, the vehicle may stop suddenly, requiring the ego vehicle to be prepared to brake or change lanes with caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

It should refrain from overtaking until there is clear visibility and space to do so safely. If the vehicles ahead are slowing or stopping, the ego vehicle should prepare to stop as well. The driver must be cautious of the limited maneuverability due to the yellow construction vehicle partially obstructing the left lane and monitor the situation for any sudden movements by the vehicles ahead."
