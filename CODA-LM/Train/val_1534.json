This truck is an immediate threat as it restricts the pathway of the ego vehicle, necessitating careful navigation to avoid any potential collision.\n\nAdditionally, visible in the distance are one or more vehicles approaching with their headlights illuminated, denoting oncoming traffic. The oncoming vehicles constrain the opportunities for the ego vehicle to execute maneuvers, especially when trying to circumvent any obstructions in its own lane.\n\nLastly, there are metal barriers present on the right-hand side of the road. These barriers delineate the border of the driving lane adjacent to a construction or industrial zone and constrict the lateral movement of the ego vehicle, limiting the amount of space available for any necessary evasive actions.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this specific traffic situation."

Keep a safe distance from the metal barriers on the right to avoid any risk of collision. Monitor the oncoming traffic and only attempt to pass the obstructing truck when it is safe and legal to do so."
