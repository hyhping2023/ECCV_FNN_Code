This vehicle's size and the overhanging load could impact lane usage and require increased following distance.\n  - A partially covered white sedan is located on the right and is likely in a parallel path with the ego car.

The presence of the truck is significant as it directly influences the driving decisions of the vehicle behind it. The driver should maintain an appropriate following distance to allow for safe stopping or maneuvering in case the truck decelerates or stops suddenly. Observing the truck's turn signals and brake lights are also crucial for anticipating its next moves, such as turns or lane changes, which will guide the driver's subsequent actions to adjust speed or switch lanes accordingly.",

Additionally, with the red traffic light visible, the ego car should prepare to stop. The driver should also be cautious of the white sedan's movements, as it may decide to change lanes or merge. Due to the bright sun glare, the ego car should reduce speed and be prepared for decreased visibility, maintaining attentiveness for any unexpected road scenarios or changes."
