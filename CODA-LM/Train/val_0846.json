On the right, a construction vehicle is positioned partially on and off the road, facing away from the ego car, indicating active construction and the potential for obstacles or workers nearby.\n\nVulnerable road users include a pedestrian walking along the right side of the road, moving away from the ego car, calling for caution and readiness to stop if they enter the roadway. Additionally, a construction worker is standing to the right side of the road in the construction area, necessitating the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down due to their unpredictability.\n\nA warning sign ahead on the right alerts of road construction, indicating potential hazards and reduced road capacity. Multiple traffic cones on the right signal the need to merge left to avoid construction areas.\n\nThis summary includes all non-empty categories and their descriptions, encompassing various vehicles, vulnerable road users, a traffic sign, and traffic cones impacting the driving behavior of the ego car."
