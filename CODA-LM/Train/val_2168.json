This vehicle is likely to move slower or make frequent stops, which can hinder traffic flow and requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a partially obscured directional road sign on the right side of the road. This sign may provide information about upcoming intersections or destinations, and it is important for the ego car to be aware of potential route changes such as turns or merges."

The construction vehicle appears to be stationary or moving slowly, requiring the ego car to possibly reduce speed and ensure a safe passing distance. Additionally, the presence of such a vehicle may suggest nearby construction activities which might cause unexpected road conditions or obstructions, thus increasing the need for heightened awareness and caution while driving.",
