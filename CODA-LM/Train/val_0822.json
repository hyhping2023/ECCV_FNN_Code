This parked van occupies part of the driving lane, which reduces the available driving space and necessitates careful passing by the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there are two traffic signs. One is a round blue sign with a white symbol of a bicycle and arrow, indicating a bike lane or a combined bike and pedestrian lane to the right of the driving lane. This informs the ego car of a designated area for bicycles next to the driving lane, which it should not enter but should remain aware of to avoid potential cyclists.\n\nThe second traffic sign is a circular red and white 'No Entry' sign located on the wall directly ahead of the van. This sign indicates that the road ahead is not accessible to the ego car and reinforces the need to turn before reaching this sign.\n\nFurthermore, orange traffic cones are placed around the base of the blue bike lane sign. These cones suggest that there might be temporary roadwork or designated pathway changes. The presence of these cones implies a potential hazard or a change in the usual traffic pattern, requiring the ego car to approach with caution and possibly prepare to adjust the lane."

In the driving scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction work or maintenance nearby. The ego car must approach with caution, potentially reducing speed and being prepared for unexpected movements or obstacles related to the construction activity. Furthermore, there might be construction workers around such vehicles, increasing the need for vigilance to ensure safety.",
