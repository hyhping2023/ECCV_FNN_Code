As they have the right of way, the ego car must yield until the crosswalk is clear.\n\nA green traffic light is observed ahead in the lane of the ego car, indicating that it can proceed once the crosswalk is clear and it is safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, orange and white traffic cones are positioned to the right, marking a boundary and serving as a visual guide to prevent the ego car from entering a restricted or unsafe area."

In this context, the bollard is positioned on the side of the road to prevent vehicles from entering certain areas such as sidewalks or pedestrian zones. For the ego car, the presence of the bollard indicates that there is a boundary separating the roadway from a non-traffic area, and the driver should stay within the appropriate traffic lanes and avoid straying into restricted zones.",
