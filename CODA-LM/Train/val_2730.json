        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a significant presence on the road that demands attention. Specifically, a large military vehicle is noted to be occupying the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The vehicle is not just any ordinary vehicle; it is described as carrying machinery. This detail is crucial as the size of the vehicle, coupled with the machinery it transports, introduces potential hazards to the surrounding traffic. The primary concern stems from the possibility of the military vehicle making sudden maneuvers or coming to an abrupt stop. Such actions could pose significant risks to the ego car and other road users, given the vehicle's large size and the nature of its cargo. It is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for any unexpected movements from the military vehicle to navigate the situation safely."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically it appears to be equipped with a crane or mechanical arm. Typically used in construction or maintenance tasks, its presence on the road requires cautious driving from nearby vehicles. The ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle. This scenario underscores the importance of adjusting speed and awareness in areas with active or parked construction machinery.",
