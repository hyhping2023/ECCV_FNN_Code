A black sedan with its trunk open, stopped on the right side of the ego vehicle. This vehicle is partially obstructing the lane and could start moving unexpectedly, requiring the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes.\n2. A silver car parked on the side under the overpass in the distance. Although it poses no immediate threat, it serves as a reminder to stay alert for potential doors opening or pedestrians stepping out from parked cars.\n\nThere are also two vulnerable road users:\n1. A cyclist on the same side of the road as the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction. This cyclist requires the ego vehicle to provide sufficient clearance when passing and to monitor for any sudden changes in the cyclist's path.\n2. Pedestrians crossing the road at a zebra crossing in front of a green light ahead of the ego vehicle. These pedestrians have the right of way, and the green traffic signal applies to them; thus, the ego vehicle must yield until the crosswalk is clear.\n\nRegarding traffic signs:\n1. A speed limit sign indicates a maximum of 40 km/h to the right of the traffic lights. This sets the speed limit for the area, suggesting that the ego vehicle should ensure its speed does not exceed this limit.\n2. A pedestrian crosswalk sign next to the speed limit sign indicates there is a pedestrian crossing ahead, alerting the ego vehicle to be cautious of pedestrians and prepared to stop.\n\nThe traffic lights show green for going straight and red for turning right, indicating that the ego vehicle is allowed to move forward but not turn right at the intersection.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are placed on the left side of the ego vehicle, demarcating a construction zone or road closure, requiring the ego vehicle to stay within the limits of the open lane.\n\nLastly, there are red and white striped barriers under the overpass on the right. These barriers mark off a restricted or construction area, indicating that the ego vehicle should not cross into that area."
