These signs are crucial as they inform about possible lane closures, roadwork, or traffic conditions that might necessitate a change of lanes or speed adjustment by the ego car. \n\nAdditionally, reflective traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, suggesting a probable lane closure or ongoing roadwork. As a result, the ego car is required to keep a safe distance and might have to merge to the left if the right lane is closed further ahead. \n\nComplementing the cones, there are temporary barriers installed. These barriers serve the purpose of reinforcing the lane closure indicated by the cones and help to safely guide the flow of traffic, thus ensuring the protection of roadwork personnel as well as the ego car. \n\nThere are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other notable objects mentioned in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic barrier, typically seen as a safety measure designed to protect vehicles from hazards or to demarcate road construction zones. In this scenario, its placement on the edge of the roadway serves to ensure that vehicles maintain a safe trajectory along their designated driving lanes, preventing accidents by keeping the vehicles within safe travel boundaries. For the ego car, recognizing this barrier is crucial for adjusting driving patterns, such as reducing speed and maintaining a safer distance to avoid any collision, especially in low-light conditions as depicted.",

It is often used at toll booths, border checkpoints, or in gated communities. The presence of such a barrier in an automotive environment indicates that the ego car must stop or slow down to potentially pay a toll, present identification, or wait for clearance before proceeding. Its reflective surface and multiple segments ensure it is visible at night, adding to its effectiveness in managing traffic flow and enhancing safety.",
