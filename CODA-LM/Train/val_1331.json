No vehicles or vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists are present in the scene. Similarly, there are no visible traffic signs or traffic lights affecting the driving environment.\n\nHowever, orange traffic cones are strategically placed in the center of the lanes approaching the toll booths. Their purpose is to direct the flow of vehicles toward the open toll lanes on either side, ensuring a safe and orderly passage through the booths without causing confusion or collisions.\n\nAdditionally, there is a barrier arm located on the left side of the image. Presumably, it is in the upright position, which allows vehicles to continue forward. The function of this barrier is to control traffic when necessary, such as requiring vehicles to stop for toll payment before being allowed to move on.\n\nTwo toll booths can be observed in the middle of the road. Notably, an attendant is standing outside the left booth, facing the approaching traffic. The toll booths serve as a checkpoint for vehicles to stop and pay the toll. The attendant standing by the booth is likely to influence the traffic flow, mandating that vehicles reduce their speed as they approach this area."
