There are three vehicles: a silver sedan parked in the middle of the road obstructing traffic flow, requiring the ego car to navigate around it cautiously; a white car in front of the ego car, indicating traffic ahead and necessitating a safe following distance; and several cars parked along the side of the road, which create blind spots and potential hazards, necessitating extra vigilance. \n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign indicating the route to a hospital. While this sign does not directly affect driving behavior, it provides useful context about the area and potential destinations.\n\nFurthermore, a few yellow and blue traffic cones are placed on the road. These likely mark a construction or work zone, requiring the ego car to exercise caution and potentially change lanes or slow down. \n\nNo pedestrians, cyclists, traffic lights, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects are noted in the data."

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone, typically utilized in road settings to indicate areas that are off-limits or to guide traffic flow. It is generally bright orange for high visibility with a reflective sleeve to catch the light of vehicle headlamps and streetlights for night visibility. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone on the road suggests a zone where vehicles should not enter, possibly due to a temporary obstruction or ongoing road work. This will influence the ego car's future driving behavior by necessitating a lane change or careful maneuvering to avoid the coned-off area, ensuring safety and adherence to road regulations.",
