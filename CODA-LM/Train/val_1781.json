        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a couple of road users and objects to take note of. Firstly, a white pickup truck is parked on the right side of the road, slightly angled towards the road with its cargo bed facing the ego vehicle. The positioning of this truck requires careful observation as there is a possibility that it could start moving onto the road, potentially affecting the ego vehicle's path. Secondly, there is a white sedan parked ahead of the pickup truck on the same side. Although it is stationary and not an immediate threat, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance. This precaution is necessary in case the sedan pulls into the lane or if there is any pedestrian movement between the parked vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there are large cable spools and various materials located on the side of the road behind the parked trucks. These objects are placed within the roadside area and are not obstructing the carriageway. While they do not directly influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior, their presence signifies the need for increased vigilance due to the potential for nearby activities related to the materials.\n\nThe traffic scene does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that require immediate attention."

Its substantial size and unique design suggest that it may be used for industrial purposes, perhaps for winding cables or large ropes. Located on the back of a truck, this wheel does not directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car in the immediate sense but suggests caution should be maintained due to the potential for unexpected movements or shifts in load if the truck were to accelerate, brake, or turn abruptly.",

Since it is located off the roadway and within a contained area, it does not have a direct impact on the immediate driving decisions of the ego car. However, being an unusual and potentially eye-catching item, it could momentarily distract a driver's attention from the road.",
