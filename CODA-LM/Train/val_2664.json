        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are several noteworthy features affecting the driving behavior. \n\nFirstly, there is a traffic sign, specifically a warning sign indicating a yield or give way situation, located on the right side of the road. This requires that the ego car be prepared to yield to any oncoming traffic or vehicles already on the road that is being merged into, ensuring safe and compliant driving practices.\n\nAdditionally, another object impacting the driving condition is a large red construction vehicle or crane, which is positioned on the road, obstructing part of the lane. This necessitates that the ego car exercises extreme caution. The driver should be ready to slow down or change lanes to safely navigate around the construction vehicle while maintaining a safe distance.\n\nThese elements in the traffic scene directly influence the decisions and maneuvers necessary to maintain safety and smooth flow of traffic."

This is typically used in large-scale infrastructure or construction projects for tasks such as lifting heavy materials or excavation. Its presence on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by potentially narrowing the drivable space and requiring the driver to slow down or maneuver carefully to maintain a safe distance. The vehicle's size and operations may also limit the visibility of road conditions ahead, thereby increasing the need for increased attention and lower speeds from the ego car.",
