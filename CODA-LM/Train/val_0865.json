        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a large industrial vehicle with a cement mixer located directly in front of the autonomous vehicle, in the same lane and traveling in the same direction. This industrial vehicle is distinctively painted in red and blue colors, and is fitted with reflective materials on its rear side. The presence of this large vehicle is significant as it may block the autonomous car's view of the road ahead, which could lead to potential risks. Therefore, it is crucial for the autonomous vehicle to maintain a greater following distance to ensure there is enough time to react to the industrial vehicle's movements or any unforeseen obstacles that may emerge on the road. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically identified as a vehicle designed for transporting heavy construction materials or equipment. It features a visible cement mixing drum and support structures, suggesting it is a cement mixer truck. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates that there might be a construction site nearby or that construction materials are being transported. For the ego car, the proximity of this vehicle requires heightened awareness and possibly reduced speed to accommodate for the size and operational nature of the construction vehicle, which may make sudden stops or maneuvers.",
