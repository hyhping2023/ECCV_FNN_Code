On the right side of the ego car, there is a white SUV positioned slightly ahead, traveling in the same direction. The presence of this SUV requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready to adjust its speed accordingly. Additionally, on the left side under the overpass, there is a large construction vehicle that appears to be stationary. This indicates potential road work ahead, suggesting that the ego car may need to slow down and possibly change lanes to navigate safely.\n\nFurthermore, there is a green traffic light visible straight ahead, signaling that the ego car has the right of way to proceed. The green light allows the ego car to continue moving forward without stopping or yielding, though it should remain vigilant for any sudden changes in the traffic light or unexpected road users."
