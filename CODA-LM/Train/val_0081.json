On the left side of the ego car, there is a black SUV on the same road, headed in a similar direction, and it's partially blocking the view to the left. This vehicle could affect the ego car's ability to change lanes or merge, and thus it should be kept under observation. Directly in front of the ego car, occupying the opposite lane, there's a white van and several motorcycles whose potential for unexpected maneuvers demands attention in order to maintain a safe distance.\n\nOn the left of the ego car's path, there's a person with a rolling device, presumably engaged in road work due to the surrounding traffic cones, presenting a safety hazard that warrants a reduced speed and heightened alertness. On the sidewalk to the ego car’s right, pedestrians are present and it appears one may be considering crossing the road, signaling the ego car to be ready to stop or yield as necessary.\n\nAs for traffic guidance, a circular blue traffic sign on the road’s right side demands that the ego car follows the indicated direction, affecting lane positioning. Aiding in the ego car’s navigation is a green traffic light ahead on the right, granting the right of way, but caution is advised since the nearby road user and potential pedestrian crossing pose risks.\n\nFinally, orange traffic cones are strategically placed about the person on the left side, marking a workspace or a hazard. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this area and consider a lane change if it can be performed securely. There are no barriers or other objects noted in the scene to impact the ego car's movement."
