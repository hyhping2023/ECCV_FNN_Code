There is a line of vehicles on the right side of the road, including cars and larger vehicles like trucks, all stationary with their brake lights on. These vehicles are likely waiting for a traffic signal or are stopped due to traffic congestion, which could affect the flow of traffic and potentially cause delays for the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, oncoming traffic is visible, consisting of several cars with their headlights on, approaching from the opposite direction. The presence of oncoming traffic requires careful driving from the ego car, particularly because visibility may be reduced during evening or nighttime conditions.\n\nPedestrians and cyclists are also present on the right side of the road, some of whom may be preparing to cross the street. The ego car must be vigilant for potential pedestrians crossing and should reduce speed to ensure safety.\n\nOverhead traffic signs are hanging over the road, but their details are not clearly visible. These signs might contain important information such as speed limits or directional changes, which could influence the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nThe traffic lights in the distance show a red light for the lane where the vehicles are stopped, confirming that the vehicles are halted due to the traffic signal. The ego car should be ready to stop if the light remains red as it approaches.\n\nLastly, traffic cones are placed along the right edge of the ego car's lane, which narrows the drivable roadway and may indicate road work or an obstruction. The ego car should keep a safe distance from these cones to avoid any potential hazards they might be marking.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects reported in the image that affect driving conditions."

It is generally made from plastic or rubber and is highly visible due to its bright orange color, often with reflective tape.
