Dustbins are typically used for the disposal of waste and are common in urban environments to maintain cleanliness. The placement of these bins near the roadway may require the driver of the ego car to be cautious, especially if the bins obstruct part of the lane or if there is activity around them such as people disposing of waste or waste collection happening.
