There are also multiple vehicles ahead in both lanes, indicating a potentially congested traffic situation. This implies that the stopped van and the density of traffic ahead could lead to a slowdown or stop-and-go traffic conditions, necessitating that the ego vehicle proceeds with caution and possibly prepares to stop.\n\nAdditionally, several orange traffic cones are aligned along the right side, signifying an area of road work or a hazard that is set apart from the active lanes. The presence of these traffic cones serves as a warning of road work or a hazard ahead, signaling the ego vehicle to reduce its speed and remain vigilant for any sudden changes or obstacles in its path.\n\nFurthermore, a yellow sign, which might indicate road work or serve as a warning, is placed on the right edge of the road but is partially obscured in the foreground of the image. Although the details of this sign are not fully visible, it likely contains critical information about the road conditions that lie ahead. Therefore, the ego vehicle should proceed with heightened caution, keeping an eye out for potential instructions or warnings conveyed by this sign.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers, suggesting that these elements are either absent from the scene or not relevant to the ego vehicle's immediate driving decisions."
