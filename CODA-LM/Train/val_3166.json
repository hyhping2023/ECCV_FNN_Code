On the right side of the road, a large white truck is parked, partially obstructing the lane. An orange traffic cone is placed in front of this truck. This scenario creates a static obstacle, reducing the available lane space and requiring the ego car to steer left to avoid the truck. Additionally, multiple cars are parked on both sides of the road, narrowing the drivable space and posing the risk of cars unexpectedly pulling out. There is a worker in reflective clothing next to the parked truck, increasing the potential safety risk as the worker may move onto the road. This necessitates the ego car to slow down and be prepared to stop. The orange traffic cone in front of the truck further indicates a hazard or work zone, signaling the need for the ego car to reduce speed and proceed with caution."

It is orange with white horizontal stripes, making it highly visible. In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone may suggest that there is a construction zone or a temporary obstruction on the road ahead.
