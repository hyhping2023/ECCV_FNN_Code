The size of the truck and the possible blind spots it can create are important for the ego vehicle to consider, especially when thinking about lane changes or overtaking.\n\nDirectly ahead, there is a group of pedestrians using the zebra crossing to cross the street. The pedestrians have the right of way, which means the ego vehicle is required to either stop or slow down to ensure their safe passage across the road.\n\nOn the right side of the intersection, there's a roundabout directional sign that guides drivers on how to traverse the roundabout, indicating that they should stay to the right to navigate it properly.\n\nAbove this roundabout directional sign is a green traffic light. This indicates that traffic is permitted to continue; however, drivers, including the ego vehicle, need to stay alert for pedestrians and others that might be entering the roundabout.\n\nLastly, there are yellow and black striped barriers to the right, which are set up around a construction zone or an area that's closed off next to the pedestrian crossing. The presence of these barriers is a warning of possible changes in the usual flow of traffic and may hint at potential hazards or obstructions in the area.\n\nNo traffic cones or other objects are reported in the scene, thus their presence is not a concern for the ego vehicle at this time."
