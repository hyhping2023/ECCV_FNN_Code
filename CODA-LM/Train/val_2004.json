        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are a few notable elements affecting the driving environment. The first category comprises vehicles, including a light-colored sedan positioned directly ahead of the ego vehicle. This sedan has its brake lights and backlights activated, signaling that it's either slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego car adjusts its speed and maintains a safe following distance to avoid any potential collisions. Further ahead, there is a line of vehicles also with their brake lights on, suggesting a scenario of slow-moving traffic or congestion. This observation indicates the need for the ego car to remain cautious, maintain a reduced speed, and be prepared to stop if the situation calls for it.\n\nBesides vehicles, the road scene includes traffic cones, specifically multiple orange cones arranged on the right side of the ego vehicleâ€™s lane. These cones indicate a lane closure or ongoing road work, necessitating a lane change to the left for the ego car if required, and urging a cautious approach when navigating around the work zone.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects highlighted in this observation, indicating their absence from the current traffic scene or their irrelevance to the immediate driving conditions of the ego car. This comprehensive overview helps in understanding the dynamics and requirements of the driving environment based on the observed elements."

Actively monitor the surroundings for any changes in traffic flow or additional instructions from road signs or traffic lights not currently visible. If necessary, safely merge away from the lane with traffic cones while respecting lane markings and nearby traffic."
