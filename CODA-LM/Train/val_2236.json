The ego vehicle must keep a safe distance from this truck due to its size and the possibility of it making sudden movements.\n\nDirectly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, there is another truck with its tail lights visible. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance and be ready for possible braking from this truck to avoid a collision.\n\nOn the left side of the road, a warning sign indicating a right curve is present. This sign informs the ego vehicle to be prepared to steer to the right while adjusting its speed appropriately to safely navigate the upcoming curve.\n\nAdditionally, there are illuminated traffic signs mounted over the road, which could provide essential information regarding the route or driving conditions. The ego vehicle should pay attention to any instructions displayed on these signs.\n\nLastly, there are traffic cones placed on the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, right before the curve. These cones potentially mark a hazard or an area of construction, advising the autonomous driving system to remain in the right-hand lane and approach the area with increased caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would impact the driving decisions of the ego vehicle."
