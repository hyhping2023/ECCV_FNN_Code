The presence of this vehicle could potentially impede the ego car's movement depending on whether it begins to move or remains stationary. Alongside the road, there are bicycles parked but no immediate sign of cyclists or pedestrians, meaning they do not pose an immediate danger, yet the situation requires monitoring for any cyclists who may enter the traffic stream. A traffic sign indicating no stopping or no parking is present and must be adhered to by the ego car to remain compliant with traffic regulations. Additionally, the traffic lights ahead show a green signal as well as a green arrow pointing straight, indicating that the ego car is allowed to continue moving forward when conditions are deemed safe. There are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that need to be accounted for."
