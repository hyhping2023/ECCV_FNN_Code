Due to the minivan's positioning, it limits the available roadway for the ego vehicle and necessitates careful steering to bypass the obstacle safely.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users present; specifically, two individuals are noticed near a barricade on the sidewalk to the right side of the image. One person is attired in a blue jacket and a helmet, while the other is wearing dark-colored clothing. The proximity of these individuals to the traffic lane poses a potential risk in case they unpredictably step onto the road.\n\nLastly, the scene includes yellow barricades embellished with black text, suggesting an ongoing construction area on the right. The presence of these barriers is an indication for the ego car to be aware of potential lane narrowing or the need to follow a detour route surrounding the construction site. The image does not feature any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or any other notable objects."

Such barriers are crucial for the safety of both the construction workers and the passing drivers. They serve as visual cues to drivers to reduce speed and be cautious, often leading to detours or altered traffic patterns.
