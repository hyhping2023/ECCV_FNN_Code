        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there is a variety of road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a white-colored sedan parked on the right side of the road, oriented head-on with respect to the ego car's perspective. This vehicle is stationary and does not pose an immediate dynamic threat but limits the available road space for the ego car and other road users.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a blue road sign with a red 'X' below it and a right-turning arrow sign. These are mounted high on a post to the left side of the road. The blue sign with the red 'X' indicates that no parking or stopping is allowed in the vicinity, while the right-turning arrow sign directs towards a destination or facility. These signs are crucial as they dictate the road usage rules that must be adhered to for legal compliance and to ensure road safety.\n\nIn terms of traffic lights, a green traffic light is visible far in the distance at the end of the road. A green light typically allows vehicles to proceed, indicating that the ego car can move forward if the road ahead is clear and other conditions are deemed safe.\n\nLastly, there are utility poles and lines present on both sides of the road. While these are not immediate obstacles to vehicles, they must be noted as potential hazards, especially in scenarios involving road work or the unexpected falling of these objects.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this traffic image, indicating a relatively clear path for the ego car with the mentioned considerations."
