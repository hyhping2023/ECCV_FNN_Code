Although this parked vehicle does not obstruct the path of the ego car, the headlights could potentially cause glare, which necessitates cautious driving. The second vehicle is a dark-colored vehicle parked on the left side of the road, with its taillights illuminated. Similar to the first, this vehicle does not block the ego car's path, but the lit taillights serve as a warning for the presence of a stationary object, around which the ego car should navigate with care. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image."

The appearance of the lit taillights suggests that the car is either active or the drivers inside are performing tasks that require the taillights to remain on, such as using the vehicle's power for lights or electronics or the vehicle is in a state of readiness for movement. For the ego car, this indicates the need for heightened awareness. The ego car's driver should monitor this vehicle closely as it may pull out or move unexpectedly, requiring adjustments in the ego car's speed or trajectory to maintain safe distances and avoid potential hazards.",
