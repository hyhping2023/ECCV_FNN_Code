        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a white car situated directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. It has its brake lights illuminated, which indicates that the vehicle is either decelerating or has come to a halt. The presence of this car has a direct impact on the ego car's ability to sustain its current velocity.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are detected in the neighboring lanes to the left. Some of these cars have their brake lights on, which suggests that traffic is moving slowly or there might be a stoppage ahead. These cars potentially influence the ego car's capacity to switch lanes in a safe manner.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the ego car, there is a motorcyclist traveling in the same direction. The proximity of the motorcyclist might sway the ego car's decisions regarding speed adjustments or changing lanes.\n\nThere are pedestrians present on the sidewalk to the left. Their presence indicates a region that likely experiences significant pedestrian traffic. Consequently, the ego car must remain alert for any jaywalkers or individuals crossing at intersections that could emerge.\n\nDirectly ahead, there is a green traffic light, which denotes that the ego car is permitted to move forward as long as the path is unblocked. However, the ego car is reliant on the response and movements of the cars ahead in order to proceed.\n\nFinally, traffic cones have been set up on the right side of the road. These signal either a road hazard or a lane closure. The presence of these cones necessitates careful driving or possibly changing lanes due to the constrained lane width or accessibility caused by the obstruction or roadwork indicated by the cones.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving conditions for the ego car."

All decisions should be made while being mindful of the surrounding traffic and maintaining a safe speed for the conditions."
