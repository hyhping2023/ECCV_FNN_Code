These serve as a warning to adjust speed and prepare for a possible lane change due to the temporary traffic pattern alteration and associated hazards.\n\nFurthermore, temporary yellow construction barriers are erected, blocking off the construction zone to the right of the ego car. This could lead to narrower lanes, potential traffic congestion, and the need for vehicles to merge, which requires additional caution from the ego car."
