They are moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This situation necessitates that the ego vehicle drives with extra caution, maintains a slow speed, and remains prepared to stop if necessary to ensure the safety of these vulnerable road users.\n\nThere are no discernible traffic signs visible in the current frame, which means that the ego vehicle must rely on general road rules and situational awareness in the absence of specific guidance.\n\nSimilarly, no traffic lights are visible, implying that the ego vehicle must navigate based on right-of-way and road markings.\n\nAdditionally, a green dustbin is placed off the roadside on the left. Such objects close to the road can pose potential hazards as they may obscure vision or become a risk if they enter the roadway. \n\nOverall, these elements necessitate careful driving behavior from the ego vehicle to ensure safety."
