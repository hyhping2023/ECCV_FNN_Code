The truck has its bright headlights and taillights on, signaling that it's currently operational. The presence of the truck may obstruct the view for the ego vehicle, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance, especially if the truck is ahead of the ego vehicle. Due to its size and the nature of being a heavy vehicle, the truck's stopping distances and maneuverability will differ from those of a passenger car, influencing how the ego vehicle navigates around it.\n\nNo additional information is provided regarding vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, as these categories do not contain any entries in the given image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large truck with a green body and multiple bright lights at the front. Trucks of this size often transport goods and materials over long distances. Due to its large size, the truck has potential blind spots and a longer stopping distance compared to smaller vehicles. Ego car drivers should maintain a safe distance when driving near such trucks to prevent collision risks, especially when overtaking or when the truck is making turns, as trucks require a wider space to maneuver.",

If the ego vehicle is preparing to overtake, it should ensure it has clear visibility and sufficient space to pass safely. Due to the reduced visibility potentially caused by nighttime conditions, the ego vehicle should have its headlights on, use high-beams if there are no oncoming vehicles, and remain vigilant for any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic patterns."
