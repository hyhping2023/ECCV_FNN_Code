Although it's not obstructing the driving path, it's essential for the ego car to keep an eye on this stationary vehicle. This caution is advised because there's a risk of sudden door openings or unexpected movement from the parked position, which could potentially affect driving behavior or necessitate evasive action. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in this scene, making the parked SUV the sole point of interest for the ego car's navigation and safety systems."

Its presence is critical for an ego car driving in this scenario, as the ego car must ensure there is adequate space to maneuver around it safely without causing a collision. The parked car's location next to the curb also indicates it is properly parked, suggesting that the area is likely a designated parking zone. The ego car driver should reduce speed and increase vigilance as maneuvering close to parked cars might involve sudden movements from pedestrians or other vehicles nearby.",
