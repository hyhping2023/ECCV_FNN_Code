This vehicle may obstruct part of the roadway or perform sudden movements that could impact the flow of traffic. Additionally, there are makeshift barriers, including a small pile of rubble and a red and white striped sign, located on the right side of the road in front of the stationary construction vehicle. These barriers signal the possibility of roadwork or an obstruction, which the ego car must maneuver around. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."

It features an adjustable boom, arm, and bucket which are used for digging and moving large quantities of materials such as soil or rubble. In a traffic scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle near the roadside suggests ongoing or potential roadwork or construction activity. The ego car needs to be cautious, potentially reduce speed, and be prepared for sudden stops or detours due to either the operations of the excavator or other related construction activities.",

The presence of such rocks in close proximity to the driving path can pose a risk of accidental collision if the ego car drifts too close to the edge. Additionally, the stone may indicate potential road hazards like landslides or fallen debris from nearby hills, especially in mountainous areas.

A safe driving practice would be for the ego car to maintain a steady speed and steer slightly away from the stone to avoid any potential hazard.",
