This vehicle's location and speed affect the ego car's lane choice and the need to maintain a safe following distance. Directly ahead in the ego car's lane, a green traffic light indicates that the ego car can continue traveling through the intersection without stopping. To the right, a construction barrier partially obstructs the adjoining lane, potentially causing vehicles in that lane to merge into the ego car's lane. Also to the right, a red forklift is positioned within a cordoned off area. While it doesn't directly impact the ego vehicle's path, the driver should stay alert in case the forklift unexpectedly enters the roadway."

Forklifts are commonly used in construction zones or industrial settings for transporting heavy materials. The presence of this type of vehicle in a traffic situation usually indicates nearby construction work or loading activities. For the ego car, this signifies the need for increased attention and possibly reduced speed to ensure safety while passing near the operating equipment or potentially waiting if the vehicle is crossing or obstructing the path.",
