        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are three primary categories of road users that notably influence the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nFirstly, there is a green truck with a mixing drum mounted on the back, which is located directly in front of the ego car. This truck occupies the same lane and heads in the same direction as the ego car. The significant size and position of the truck are major factors restricting the ego car’s ability to make overtaking maneuvers. Moreover, the presence of a mixing drum indicates the truck might be associated with slow-moving construction activities, which could impact its speed and maneuverability.\n\nAccompanying the truck, a cyclist is present riding on the right side of the lane ahead of the ego car, staying adjacent to the aforementioned truck. The existence of the cyclist requires the ego car to slow down and maintain ample separation. Due to the cyclist’s position near the large truck, safely passing him entails careful consideration of overtaking space as well as the unpredictable movements of the truck.\n\nLastly, there is a pile of construction material, presumably sand, on the right side of the road near where the cyclist rides. These construction materials are significant as they could potentially spill onto the roadway, creating additional hazards that need to be factored into the ego car's path planning.\n\nThe current scene does not include traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that affect the ego car's navigation in this specific setting."
