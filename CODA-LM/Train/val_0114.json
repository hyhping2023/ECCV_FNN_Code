Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a black SUV with its brake lights on, indicating it might be slowing down or stopped. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop due to the SUV's behavior. To the left, in an adjacent lane, a silver car is traveling in the same direction as the ego car, which requires the ego car to be cautious of any potential lateral movements, such as lane changes. On the right side of the intersection, a red microcar is waiting, possibly to merge or cross, and its intentions must be monitored as it could enter the ego car's path. A white van is also present in the far-left lane, moving in the same direction, and while it is less of an immediate concern, its presence should still be acknowledged for overall situational awareness.\n\nA cyclist is crossing the road ahead on the right-hand side of the intersection, and with the green traffic signal for their path, the ego car must ensure the cyclist can cross safely. Round blue traffic signs with white arrows are located in the middle and sides of the intersection, directing traffic lanes to follow mandatory directions, which is crucial for the ego car to navigate the intersection correctly.\n\nThe traffic light straight ahead is green, allowing the ego car to proceed through the intersection with caution, while adhering to the right of way rules. On the right-hand side of the ego vehicle's lane, there is a series of orange and white traffic cones indicating a closed-off area of the road. The ego car will need to stay to the left to avoid the cones and the section they are protecting.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
