It's also crucial that the ego car navigates with caution keeping in mind the close proximity of pedestrians; it must be ready to brake suddenly if a pedestrian steps onto the road. Reduced speed in areas with pedestrians is always a good safety practice. Monitoring the surroundings for any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic conditions, even if not currently visible in the image, is also essential for safe driving."
