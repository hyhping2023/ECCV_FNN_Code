Firstly, there is one brown SUV and two white sedans parked on the left side, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. These vehicles are stationary and do not pose a dynamic threat; however, they do restrict the driving space available on the left side.\n\nAdditionally, there is a line of yellow and black traffic cones directly in front of the ego vehicle, signaling a roadblock. The presence of these cones indicates that the road ahead may be closed, or an obstruction is present, necessitating the ego vehicle to either navigate around them or come to a stop.\n\nOn the right side, adjacent to the parked vehicles, there is a portable green and red kiosk. While this kiosk is situated off the roadway and does not directly interfere with the ego vehicle's course, it is worth noting as it might hide pedestrians who could be preparing to cross or suddenly enter into the vehicle's path."

The ego vehicle should also remain alert for any pedestrians that might be obscured by the kiosk on the right side."
