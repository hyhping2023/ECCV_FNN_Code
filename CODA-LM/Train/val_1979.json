This allows the ego car to continue in its current lane without needing to adjust for other vehicles.\n\nSecondly, a traffic sign is situated on the right side of the road. The sign appears to show an arrow that indicates a merging of lanes or a change in direction. This sign alerts the ego car that it may need to make changes soon, such as switching lanes or modifying its speed to adapt to the upcoming road layout change.\n\nLastly, the traffic light that the ego car needs to heed is showing red. This means the ego car is required to come to a full stop and wait until the light turns green before continuing its journey.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones set up on the right, indicating either a closed lane or that there are roadworks ahead. The ego car should acknowledge this by staying in its lane, decreasing its speed, and being cautious of any potential obstacles or personnel working on the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects recorded in the JSON data that would influence the ego car's current driving conditions."
