The first vehicle is a white sedan located in the left lane, directly ahead of the ego car, with its brake lights on, suggesting a potential slowdown or stop. The ego car must keep a safe distance from this sedan and be ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if the sedan comes to a stop or reduces its speed significantly. Another white sedan is in the right lane, positioned ahead and to the right of the ego car, also displaying brake lights. The ego car needs to watch this vehicle closely for any lane changes or abrupt braking and may need to alter its speed and lane position in response. Additionally, there are multiple bright orange traffic cones arranged in a row, signaling that the left lane is closed ahead. The ego car should avoid entering the left lane due to the closure and should stay in the current lane or shift to the right if necessary. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Typically bright orange with reflective bands, these cones are easily visible, alerting drivers to slow down or shift lanes to ensure both driver and roadside worker safety. In this tunnel scenario, the placement of the cone suggests either a lane closure or a need for drivers to merge into an adjacent lane, thereby influencing the driving behavior to adjust speed and lane position appropriately.",
