The ego car needs to be vigilant of these vehicles as they might engage in lane changes or additional maneuvers, requiring careful attention to all lanes.\n\nPedestrians can be seen around the crosswalk ahead, with some preparing to step onto the roadway while others are already crossing. The ego car is required to give way to these pedestrians and must navigate with care to guarantee pedestrian safety.\n\nAdditionally, on the left roadside, a 'No U-turn' sign is noticeable, instructing drivers, including the ego car, that U-turns are prohibited at this junction and this restriction must be respected.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light facing the ego car exhibits a green signal, indicating that it and other vehicles in the same lane are granted the right-of-way to proceed.\n\nLastly, orange traffic cones have been arranged on the intersection's left side delineating the division between lanes. These cones likely highlight a lane closure or a designated driving path which must be followed. The ego car is obliged to avoid crossing these cones and should remain within its lane.\n\nNo barriers or other objects are described within the scene, hence they do not influence the ego car's driving decisions in the current environment."
