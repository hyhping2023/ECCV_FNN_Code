It is characterized by its large rotating drum, which is used to mix and transport concrete. This type of vehicle is typically used in areas undergoing construction or infrastructure development. In this traffic scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle suggests that there might be active construction nearby, and it could influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed, increased vigilance for sudden stops or debris, and possibly adherence to altered traffic patterns or detours dictated by construction activities.",
