It is likely to be moving slower due to its heavy load. This truck will influence the speed and possible lane changes of the ego car.\n   - A second truck is visible to the left of the ego car in an opposing lane, suggesting a two-way road.

This type of vehicle is commonly used in construction projects for transporting heavy machinery.

The presence of this vehicle indicates that there may be upcoming roadworks or construction sites ahead.

Paying attention to the overhead road sign for directions and possible lane changes is advised. Maintaining lane discipline and preparing for any change in road conditions due to the presence of barriers to the right is also suggested."
