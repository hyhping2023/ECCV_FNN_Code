        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large truck ahead positioned in the rightmost lane. The truck is easily distinguishable as a white rectangle with a conspicuous back and side, located near the road signs in the distance. The presence of the truck is an indicator of traffic flow and it occupies its lane completely. This has implications for the ego car's lane choice and the distance it needs to maintain from the truck.\n\nOverhead in the distance are multiple green traffic signs providing directional information and lane designations. These signs are important for the ego vehicle as it allows the driver to select the correct lane in order to follow the intended route.\n\nAdditionally, there is a sequence of brightly colored, alternating yellow and red traffic cones placed on the right side of the road. These begin near the ego car and continue into the distance, signaling a possible lane closure, roadworks, or a traffic event ahead. As a result, the ego car must exercise caution and may need to change from the right lane to the left.\n\nNext to the highway, there is a continuous green metal barrier on the right side, effectively segregating oncoming lanes or different sections of the road. The barrier functions to limit access to areas beside the highway and to oncoming traffic, which enforces the necessity for the ego car to stay within its lane and observe lane discipline.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects are reported in the scene, indicating that the aforementioned factors are the primary considerations for the ego car's navigation through the current traffic conditions."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a set of traffic cones with alternating white and red stripes, typically used to indicate temporary changes in traffic patterns or to alert drivers to roadwork or hazards. In this driving scenario, they are positioned to form a barrier directing vehicles away from the lane closer to the median, guiding the traffic flow into the other available lanes. This arrangement can influence the driving behavior by necessitating a lane change if the ego vehicle is currently in the lane being closed off by these cones.",

Barriers like this are usually placed to partition or close off lanes during roadworks or accidents more permanently and sturdily than cones. The bright colors and patterns (often striped) improve visibility. Barriers influence driving behavior by delineating the driving space more rigidly, guiding the ego car to stay in the open lanes and reduce speed as needed for safe passage through altered road layouts.",
