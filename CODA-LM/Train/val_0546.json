Directly ahead of the ego vehicle, there's a white sedan occupying the same lane at a standard distance, necessitating attention to following distance and speed in case of sudden stops. To the left, a black van with brake lights on suggests it might be slowing down or stopping, potentially changing lanes into the ego vehicle's path. In the adjacent right lane, a blue pick-up truck is moving in the same direction, relevant if the ego car needs to change lanes. Additionally, multiple red tail lights are visible ahead, indicating other vehicles that may slow down or stop, impacting the ego car's speed and following distance.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, pedestrians are visible near a bus stop to the right, though they are not on the roadway. These pedestrians should be monitored in case they decide to cross. A motorcyclist is also present ahead to the right, in an adjacent lane, requiring careful monitoring due to their unpredictable movements and visibility limitations.\n\nThe traffic light directly ahead is green, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed but necessitating awareness for potential changes to yellow or red. A single traffic cone is noted beside the bus stop area on the right, not directly impacting the ego vehicle's path but indicating possible nearby construction or obstacles, suggesting a need for caution."

The lighting on the car indicates that it might be braking or preparing to stop. This will influence the ego car's driving behavior, as it will need to maintain a safe following distance or prepare to stop if the traffic situation requires. Understanding the brake light signals helps in avoiding rear-end collisions by allowing sufficient reaction time for the ego car.",

Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for possible changes in traffic flow due to the vehicles ahead and maintain awareness of the pedestrians at the bus stop and the motorcyclist. The traffic light is green, so the ego car may proceed but should be attentive to its changing state. The presence of the traffic cone suggests caution, so the ego vehicle should be observant for any signs of road works or related disruptions ahead."
