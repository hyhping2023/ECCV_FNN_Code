        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that influence the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, a sedan is noticed on the right side, positioned in the adjacent lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this vehicle is significant as it restricts the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right, necessitating continuous monitoring to maintain a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, concrete barriers are identified on both sides of the highway. These barriers create a divided roadway and limit the available escape routes for the ego car. Consequently, the ego car is required to stay within its lane and adjust its speed according to the traffic flow, ensuring safety and compliance with road regulations.\n\nAnother critical observation is an unidentified object located in the middle of the right lane ahead of the ego car. This object poses a potential road hazard, compelling the ego car to either change lanes or decelerate to avoid a collision, thereby ensuring the safety of all road users.\n\nIt is noted that there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones present in this traffic image, indicating that these categories do not influence the current driving scenario for the ego car."

Its presence on the road could potentially be a hazard to vehicles, particularly if it obscures drivers' view or if it gets caught in vehicle components such as the wheels or undercarriage. The ego car needs to monitor such obstacles closely and be prepared to either maneuver around it safely or drive over it if it is unavoidable and safe to do so, making sure it does not affect vehicle handling or safety.",

The ego car should also reduce speed to ensure a safe stopping distance given the unclear road conditions ahead caused by haze, particularly if the need arises to navigate around the object on the road."
