However, there is a directional sign on the left side of the road, which is well-lit and indicates various directions or locations. This sign is useful for navigation but does not immediately affect driving decisions unless a turn is needed as per the ego car's route.\n\nAhead, on the right side, there is a traffic light displaying a green signal, granting the ego car the right to proceed. Despite the green light, caution is advised due to low visibility conditions that are suggested by the image quality.\n\nSeveral traffic cones are positioned in the middle of the road, likely signaling a lane closure or ongoing roadwork. These cones require the ego car to alter its lane position to safely navigate around the potential obstacles or roadwork area.\n\nA barrier gate is seen on the left, blocking access to a side path or property, but it does not pose an immediate concern for the ego car traveling on the main road.\n\nLastly, there are light reflections and glare on the road surface, possibly from wet conditions and puddles. These could impair the sensors or cameras on the ego car, leading to reduced visibility or misinterpretation of road conditions. Extra care should be taken to ensure the autonomous driving system accurately interprets the scene."
