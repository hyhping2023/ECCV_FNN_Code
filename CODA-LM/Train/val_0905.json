Additionally, there are no visible traffic signs or traffic lights to inform or direct the traffic flow.  \n\nHowever, there is a traffic cone placed on the right edge of the road, within the ego car's lane. This cone is orange and white, adhering to the typical color scheme to ensure it is highly visible and indicates caution to oncoming drivers. The placement of the traffic cone suggests there might be a potential hazard, ongoing construction, or a narrowing of the lane ahead. It is strategically positioned to guide vehicles away from the edge or to initiate a merge to the left if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, there is a yellow object, which appears to be a bollard, also located on the right edge of the road. The purpose of this object is to signal to drivers the boundary of the road or to indicate a no-entry area for vehicles. It acts as a warning to the driver to be aware of the road's edge and indicates a possible need for caution when driving close to this particular point on the road.\n\nNo barriers or other objects are present in the image."

The presence of this cone indicates to the ego car that there might be potential hazards ahead such as construction, road damage, or roadside incidents that require the driver to slow down, be more cautious, or possibly reroute to avoid the designated area.
