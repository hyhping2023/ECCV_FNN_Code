            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically appearing to be a cement mixer. It is characterized by its large cylindrical mixing drum mounted at the rear and the heavy-duty structure typical of construction equipment. The presence of this vehicle in the driving scenario can significantly affect the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a reduction in speed and an increase in caution. Operating near such vehicles often requires vigilance due to their large blind spots and the potential for sudden stops or movements associated with construction activities. Moreover, if the cement mixer is in operation, further precautions may be needed due to possible debris or spilling from the mixer.",

Stay alert for any construction-related signs or signals that may provide further instructions."
