This could potentially obstruct the ego car's navigation and limit the available space. Additionally, there are multiple cars ahead of the ego vehicle in the middle and left lanes, indicating moderate traffic flow. These vehicles necessitate careful consideration of speed and distance to ensure a safe following distance.\n\nA directional sign is visible above the rightmost lane, offering information on lane usage for upcoming roads or exits. This sign should be used by the ego car to plan any necessary lane changes, especially if a turn or exit is approaching.\n\nFurthermore, there is a barrier on the right side of the road, separating the roadway from the pedestrian path. This ensures that traffic stays within designated lanes, and the ego car should be cautious not to drift into non-traffic areas.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects were noted in the image."
