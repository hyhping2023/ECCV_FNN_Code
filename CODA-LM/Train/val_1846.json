The presence of the minivan may require the ego car to monitor for potential lane changes, as the minivan could move closer to the ego car's lane. On the right side of the road, ahead of the ego car, a white van is parked. This van could block the view for the ego car, which means the driver should proceed with extra caution and be vigilant for any unforeseen obstacles that might appear. Furthermore, several heavy vehicles, including a blue water tanker with a visible yellow hose and various construction equipment, are also parked on the right. This situation indicates there could be construction activity nearby, and the ego car should be ready to encounter unexpected movements and possibly workers on the road.\n\nIn addition to vehicles, there is a vulnerable road user; specifically, a cyclist is spotted on the right-hand side, next to the parked vehicles, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The erratic nature of cyclists, who might change direction to evade obstacles, means that the ego car should keep a safe distance and overtake with care.\n\nThe JSON data provided does not list any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, which implies there are none of these items visible in the traffic image."
