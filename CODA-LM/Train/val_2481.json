This car is stationary and does not pose an immediate threat, but it requires that a safe distance be maintained when passing by. Pedestrians are observed on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car. Although they are not on the road, their proximity to the street means there is a potential risk of someone entering the roadway unexpectedly, which necessitates vigilance from the driver. Various traffic signs and commercial billboards are present on the right side of the road. These are not regulatory signs that directly affect driving behavior, but drivers need to be alert to any traffic signs that may be obscured. No traffic lights are visible in the image, so the ego car should continue to adhere to the basic rules of the road in their absence. Metal barriers are in place to protect a tree in the sidewalk area on the right, indicating that drivers should avoid veering onto the sidewalk. Lastly, there are black trash bags on the sidewalk to the right, close to the parked car. While these bags do not directly impact the driving path, they suggest that the area may contain further debris or obstacles. Traffic cones are not present in this image, and thus, no action or consideration is required regarding them."
