On the right side, and in proximity to the ego vehicle, there is a yellow vehicle, possibly a taxi, which is sharing the same direction of travel. This vehicle must be observed carefully as it may change lanes or adjust its speed without warning. Further ahead in the left lane, a red vehicle is also traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, whose speed and distance should be monitored to keep a safe following distance in case that vehicle should decelerate or come to a halt.\n\nIn addition, there is an issue with the traffic lights; their condition is unclear due to the angle and quality of the image. Given this uncertainty, the ego vehicle must proceed with heightened caution, ready to adapt to the actual traffic light state once it becomes visible upon approaching the intersection.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects indicated in the data that impact the driving scenario for the ego vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large vehicle, specifically a truck, appearing in the image. Trucks are often much larger and heavier compared to typical passenger cars, which impacts their braking distance and maneuverability. This particular truck is driving ahead of the ego vehicle, likely influencing the ego cars speed and spacing on the road. The driver of the ego car will need to maintain a safe distance from the truck to account for these differences in vehicle dynamics, especially in situations of sudden traffic slowdowns or stops.",

Due to the unclear status of the traffic lights and potentially wet road conditions, be prepared to reduce speed to accommodate for increased stopping distances and reduced visibility. Keep a lookout for traffic signals becoming visible as the ego vehicle approaches the intersection, and be ready to comply with the traffic controls. Also, watch for any potential lane changes from the yellow vehicle on the right, and adjust positioning or speed to ensure a safe buffer around the ego vehicle."
