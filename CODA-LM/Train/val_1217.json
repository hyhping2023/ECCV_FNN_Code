        "description and explanation": "In the given traffic image, several road features and objects require the attention of the autonomous driving system. Although there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present, other elements are still prominent.\n\nFirstly, there are traffic cones positioned on the left side of the road. These cones mark a demarcation indicating either ongoing roadwork or a section of the road that is closed. The presence of these cones signals a potential hazard or an unsafe section, necessitating the ego vehicle to adjust its driving path to avoid this area.\n\nIn addition to the traffic cones, there are temporary barriers also visible on the left side of the road. These barriers are likely set up to denote construction zones or areas that are off-limits to vehicles. They serve as a crucial visual guide to ensure that the ego vehicle remains on the correct path and steers clear of prohibited or hazardous zones.\n\nMoreover, on the right side of the road, there are other objects including a blue and a red dustbin. While these bins are positioned off the road, their presence is significant as they could indicate zones where pedestrian activity is probable, or where debris might be pushed onto the road, thus requiring vigilance.\n\nOverall, these elements in the environment are critical for the autonomous driving system to navigate safely and efficiently by adapting to visual cues and potential road hazards."
