The ego vehicle must consider the speed and distance to this car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there are multiple parked cars on both sides of the road, which reduce the lane width and visibility. The ego car will need to navigate carefully and be alert for potential obstacles that might emerge from between the parked cars.\n\nOn the side of the road, there is a person standing near a parked motorcycle, facing away from the traffic. This individual and their motorcycle could pose potential risks, as the person might step onto the roadway or the motorcycle might start moving. The ego car will need to monitor this situation closely.\n\nLastly, there is a barrier on the right side of the road, indicating a construction or no-access zone adjacent to the sidewalk. This barrier limits the available driving space, making it necessary for the ego car to stay within the marked lane and avoid getting too close to the side."

Mopeds typically travel at a lower speed than cars. In the context of driving behavior for the ego car, being aware of the moped's presence is crucial because mopeds can be less stable than cars and may make sudden moves or turns. Therefore, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance, anticipate any potential changes in the moped's path, and be prepared to react accordingly to avoid any collisions.",

Caution should be exercised when passing parked vehicles, as doors may open unexpectedly or pedestrians could move into the street. The person near the parked motorcycle should be observed, and the car should be prepared to stop or slow down if they move into the driving lane. The ego car should also maintain a steady course, staying clear of the barrier on the side of the road to avoid any obstructions and maintaining a safe lateral distance. No sudden maneuvers should be executed unless necessary to prevent collision or respond to an unexpected road user's actions."
