        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, various road users and elements are present, affecting how the autonomous vehicle must navigate through the area. \n\nStarting with vehicles, there's a large yellow construction truck prominently positioned with its crane arm extended over part of the roadway. This significant obstruction necessitates cautious driving from the autonomous vehicle, potentially requiring a lane change or a reduction in speed to ensure safe passage around the impediment. Additionally, there are several cars parked along the side of the road, narrowing the available driving space and demanding heightened alertness from the autonomous vehicle to adjust its lane position accordingly.\n\nConcerning vulnerable road users, the scene comprises a group of pedestrians adjacent to the road. Their proximity poses a risk of unexpected movement into the vehicle's path, warranting a reduction in speed and readiness to stop or maneuver if necessary. A cyclist is also observed in the distance, signaling the need for increased vigilance and preparedness for abrupt movements that could impact the vehicleâ€™s trajectory.\n\nIn terms of road infrastructure, a directional sign is noted, offering guidance on potential routes and turns ahead. Although it doesn't directly influence immediate driving behavior, it furnishes useful information for upcoming navigational decisions.\n\nFinally, temporary barriers or fences are positioned along the road's edge, demarcating the construction area from the traffic lanes. These barriers mandate that the autonomous vehicle maintains its course within the designated lanes, avoiding any encroachment into the construction zone.\n\nThe absence of traffic lights, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects in the scene simplifies the driving context to some extent, focusing the vehicle's attention on the described road users and elements."

Buses are designed for mass transportation and are typically found on city roads, serving as public transport. The presence of a bus on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car by potentially causing delays or requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance.
