Firstly, there is a blue three-wheeler parked on the side of the road to the right, with its rear facing the ego car. This vehicle is stationary, partially occupying the road and thus possibly narrowing the driving lane for the ego car. Further ahead, on both sides of the road, several cars are parked in parallel to the road. These parked cars constrict the available road width, demanding cautious maneuvering by the ego car to safely pass through.\n\nAdditionally, there is a person standing on the right sidewalk near the parked blue three-wheeler. The individual poses a potential risk as there is a chance they might step onto the road, which means the ego car should remain vigilant while driving past.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image; hence, the ego car does not need to consider these elements in its current driving decisions."
