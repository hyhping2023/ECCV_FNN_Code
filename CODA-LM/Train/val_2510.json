A green waste collection vehicle is positioned in front of the ego car, occupying the right side of the lane with its red brake lights illuminated. This indicates that the waste collection vehicle may be slowing down or preparing to stop. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to either stop or slow down.\n2. A white sedan is visible on the left side, entering the same lane ahead of the ego car through the windshield. This suggests that the sedan is merging or changing lanes, potentially affecting lane availability and requiring the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there are several construction workers wearing high-visibility vests situated on the right side of the road. Their proximity to the road means they could potentially enter the road space, necessitating slower speeds and increased vigilance from the ego car.\n\nFurthermore, orange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the truck, indicating a work zone or an area to be avoided. These cones suggest lane narrowing or obstructions ahead, requiring the ego car to potentially change lanes to the left or reduce speed to safely navigate past the work zone."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer. It is characterized by its large mixing drum at the rear, used for mixing and transporting concrete. The presence of this vehicle directly influences the driving behavior of nearby vehicles, including the ego car. It may lead to slower traffic flow due to its size and operational nature at construction sites. Drivers in its vicinity, including the ego car, should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement, as these vehicles often make frequent stops and start operations at construction sites.",

Mopeds are generally slower and less stable than cars, requiring other drivers, including those in the ego car, to exercise caution when overtaking or when in close proximity. The ego car must be aware of the mopeds position and potential maneuvering actions, maintaining a safe following distance and being ready to adjust speed or direction quickly due to the moped's vulnerability and possible unpredictable movements in traffic.",

Slow down as appropriate for the work zone indicated by the traffic cones and the presence of workers. Due to the wet road condition, increase following distances, reduce speed, and exercise caution to maintain vehicle control."
