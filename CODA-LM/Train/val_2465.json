A concrete mixer truck is directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car, moving forward. The size and potential slow speed of the truck might affect the traffic flow, necessitating a safe following distance for the ego car.\n2. A sedan is observed on the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, also in motion. The ego car must be cautious of possible lane changes or movements from the sedan.\n3. A bus is present in the far-right lane, proceeding forward. The bus may make stops, influencing the traffic flow and requiring the ego car to be attentive to these changes.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\nA cyclist is positioned on the far-right side of the image, beside the bus. The ego car must exercise caution, particularly when considering a right lane change or in case the cyclist adjusts their position on the road.\n\nTraffic Signs:\nThere's a directional sign above the road to the left edge of the image, indicating which lanes are for turning and which are for going straight. This sign aids the ego vehicle in lane selection according to the intended route.\n\nTraffic Lights:\nA green traffic light is present for the lane that is directly in front of the ego car, allowing the vehicle to continue forward if the conditions are clear.\n\nTraffic Cones:\nA row of traffic cones is placed on the right side of the road, signaling a closed section of the lane or ongoing road work. The ego car must avoid merging into the space near the cones and stay alert for possible hazards or workers present on the road.\n\nOther Objects:\nThere is a dustbin and a utility pole situated on the sidewalk to the right. These objects do not impose a direct impact on the driving path, but situational awareness is essential to maintain readiness for unforeseen events."
