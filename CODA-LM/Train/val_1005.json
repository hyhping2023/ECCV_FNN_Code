The equipment includes yellow forklifts and excavators, which are placed parallel to and close to the driving lane. The proximity of these vehicles to the traffic lane presents a hazard as they might move into or near the driving lane, thereby posing a risk to the ego vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, an array of orange traffic cones is seen on the right side of the road, marking the separation between the construction zone and the driving lane. The irregular placement of these cones indicates an ongoing construction area, signaling the need for drivers to exercise caution when navigating this stretch.\n\nAdditionally, there are accumulations of snow by the roadside, hinting at recent snowfalls or clearing operations. This suggests that the weather conditions may be cold, which could affect driving safety and the traction of vehicles on the road surface, necessitating careful driving. \n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers are not present in this traffic scenario."
