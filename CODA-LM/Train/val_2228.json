The scooter's presence is significant because it might change lanes or stop to make deliveries, which would influence the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nSeveral pedestrians are observed standing under the coverage of the building on the roadway's right-hand side. While not on the road at this moment, their proximity indicates they might cross or enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, individuals are walking on the sidewalk on the right side of the road, moving away from the ego car. Their activity near the road edge presents a risk as they could enter the road suddenly, prompting the ego car to remain vigilant.\n\nLastly, reflections on the glass building facade are distorting the view. These reflections can be a source of distraction and potentially conceal other road users, necessitating careful observation by the ego car."
