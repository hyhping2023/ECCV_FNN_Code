Additionally, there are two parked cars on the right side of the road, positioned one behind the other. These parked vehicles necessitate caution as they could lead to possible obstructions or hazards, especially if pedestrians were to appear suddenly from between them. Furthermore, a black sedan is observed traveling in the rightmost lane in the same direction as the ego car, which helps in assessing the flow of traffic and potential lane usage.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, a motorcyclist is spotted merging into the rightmost lane from the shoulder, necessitating extra vigilance from the ego car to maintain a safe distance and adjust speed accordingly.\n\nTraffic signs in view include a speed limit sign that sets the maximum allowable travel speed for the ego car at 50 km/h and a no parking sign adjacent to it, indicating that stopping or parking is not permitted in the vicinity.\n\nThe traffic light situation is straightforward with a green light directly over the intersection, signaling that the ego car has the all-clear to proceed.\n\nBarriers are also present, with red and white striped ones on the right side of the road hinting at road work or a closed lane. This indicates that the ego car should be prepared for any shifts in the traffic pattern or to stay in the current lane.\n\nThe categories of traffic cones and other objects are not represented in this scenario, as their corresponding lists in the JSON data are empty, suggesting no presence of such objects in the current traffic image."
