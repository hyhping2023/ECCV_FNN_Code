Firstly, there is a blue bus on the left side of the intersection, moving across the ego car's field of view. The presence of the bus is significant as it may potentially cut across the path of the ego car or obstruct its view of oncoming traffic, necessitating careful observation due to its large size.\n\nAdditionally, assorted cars are present in various lanes around the intersection, with some moving and others appearing to be stopped. These vehicles indicate the current state of traffic flow, signaling that the ego car should be prepared to either stop or proceed with caution, depending on the traffic signal and the behavior of these vehicles.\n\nThe intersection also hosts multiple motorcyclists and cyclists in various positions relative to the ego car, alongside pedestrians crossing the street in front of the ego car. The motorcyclists and cyclists require careful attention from the ego car due to their smaller size and increased vulnerability, ensuring no unsafe interactions occur as they may travel at different speeds and paths. Pedestrians, having the right of way, necessitate that the ego car yields to them until they have safely crossed to the other side.\n\nA \"No parking\" sign is visible on the right side of the road, informing that stopping or parking in this area is prohibited. Although this sign does not immediately impact the driving behavior, it is crucial for the ego car to be aware of such regulations.\n\nThe traffic light facing the ego car is red, mandating that the ego car must remain stopped until the light turns green, directly influencing the immediate action the ego car should take.\n\nLastly, a metal fence runs along the right side of the intersection, implying that pedestrians should be crossing at designated crosswalks, and the ego car should not expect jaywalkers from that direction.\n\nThis comprehensive overview of the traffic scene, including vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers, outlines the various factors the ego car must consider to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently."
