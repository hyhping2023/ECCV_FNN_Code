The only traffic sign visible is a green directional sign at a distance, which is essential for guiding drivers along their route but does not have an immediate effect on driving behavior. Although there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects affecting traffic movement, the presence of concrete barriers on both sides of the road is noteworthy. These barriers play a crucial role in channelizing the traffic, keeping the vehicles within the designated driving lanes, and safeguarding against off-road hazards."
