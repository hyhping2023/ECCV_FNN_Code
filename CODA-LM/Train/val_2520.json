Directly in front of the ego car, there is a large commercial vehicle. Its rear lights are on, which suggests that it is either stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle's presence requires the ego car to be prepared to slow down or potentially change lanes to overtake.\n\nAdditionally, there is a passenger car positioned ahead and to the right of the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car will need to monitor this car's behavior closely, as it may affect the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic image includes multiple traffic signals, with the far-right signal displaying a red light for the lane the ego car is in. This indicates that the ego car should be ready to stop if the red light is applicable to its lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the ego car's driving behavior."
