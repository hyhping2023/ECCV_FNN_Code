As a result, the ego car needs to slow down and prepare for either a stop or a lane change to maintain safety. Additionally, there are temporary blue and orange striped barriers on both sides of the road, indicating a constriction of road space and a possible redirection of traffic. This requires the ego car to proceed with caution. Lastly, there is some debris or plastic bags on the side of the road near the barriers. This presents a potential hazard as the debris could end up on the road, necessitating the ego car to remain vigilant and ready to avoid any obstacles that might appear on the driving path."
