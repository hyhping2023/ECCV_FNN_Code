            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, commonly used as a temporary traffic control device. It is typically made from a lightweight, brightly colored material such as orange plastic, often with a reflective strip to make it more visible during low light conditions. Traffic cones are used to alert drivers to areas where they need to slow down or maneuver carefully, such as construction zones or lanes that are temporarily closed. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone indicates that the driver of the ego car should remain cautious and possibly adapt their driving pattern by reducing speed and being prepared for potential hazards ahead.",

Originally it was designed for mooring boats, but in road use, bollards are employed to control or direct road traffic, such as preventing cars from entering a specific area, guiding traffic, or protecting pedestrians. In this context, the bollard appears to be used to deter vehicles from entering the pedestrian zone adjacent to the roadway or to separate different lanes of traffic. The influence on the driving behavior in this scenario includes not making any maneuvers that might bring the car close to these bollards to avoid collisions.",
