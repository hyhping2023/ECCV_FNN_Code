This requires the ego car to maintain a safe stopping distance behind the sedan. On the left side, there are two motorcyclists—one in motion and the other seemingly waiting to cross—and a pedestrian on the sidewalk. The presence of these motorcyclists and the pedestrian necessitates careful monitoring by the ego car to anticipate any entry onto the road or crossing of the street. Additionally, a 'No U-Turn' sign is visible to the right of the white sedan, indicating that U-turns are not allowed at this intersection, thus informing the ego car's turning options. The traffic light above the road in front of the ego car shows a red signal, which requires the ego car to stop before the pedestrian crossing and remain stationary until the light turns green."
