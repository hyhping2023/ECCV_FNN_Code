In the vehicle category, there's a white van stationed on the right side of the road, facing the camera's perspective. This van appears to be parked or momentarily stopped, posing no immediate obstruction to the ego car's path.\n\nTurning our attention to vulnerable road users, a cyclist is spotted midway through a crossing, moving from the left to the right side of the image. This movement necessitates vigilant monitoring by the ego vehicle, as the cyclist could potentially cross into its path.\n\nAmong the traffic signs, a notable presence is a blue directional sign adorned with a left-pointing arrow, situated in the foreground on the left. This sign is indicative of a detour or a specific route the ego car should follow, thus guiding its direction of travel.\n\nThe image is devoid of any traffic lights, leaving the ego car to navigate the intersection based on other traffic control devices or the general rules of the road.\n\nAn array of orange and white traffic cones are strategically placed in a line across the road, demarcating a section on the left as off-limits. These cones signal the presence of roadwork or a lane closure, necessitating a reroute away from the designated area.\n\nIn contrast, barriers do not make a significant appearance in the image, denoting the absence of immediate road closures apart from the zone cordoned off by traffic cones. \n\nLastly, other objects, including brooms and unidentifiable items leaning against a wall adjacent to the directional sign, are noted. These items are positioned on the sidewalk, far removed from the road space, thus having no bearing on driving decisions.\n\nEach of these elements contributes to the overall driving context, requiring careful consideration and navigation by the autonomous driving system."

Traffic cones are used to signal areas of caution on the road, guide traffic in a specific direction, or indicate areas that are off-limits for vehicles. In this scenario, the presence of a traffic cone suggests that there is a potential obstacle or specific traffic direction that drivers, including the ego car, need to be aware of. It prompts drivers to slow down or steer in a manner that avoids the designated area. Such cones contribute to maintaining orderly traffic flow and enhancing road safety",
