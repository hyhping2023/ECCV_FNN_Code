It is white and there is no visible activity around it, indicating that it is stationary. Although this vehicle is not currently affecting the traffic flow, it does reduce the width of the usable lane, which must be considered by the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is an oncoming vehicle approaching with its headlights on. It appears to be moving at a low speed, likely due to crowded conditions. This vehicle is part of the oncoming traffic and requires attention, as it may influence the ego vehicle's ability to navigate safely through the available road space.\n\nOn the right side, there is a truck that is parked and only partially visible. It appears to be stationary. The presence of the truck narrows the drivable roadway on the right, and this must be taken into account when calculating the ego vehicle's trajectory.\n\nA motorcyclist is also present in the center of the road, facing the ego vehicle, and appears to be in motion. The motorcyclist is directly influencing the flow of traffic and the available space for the ego car to maneuver, which is a critical factor for the ego vehicle's driving decisions.\n\nLastly, there are street vendor carts on the right side of the road, accompanied by a pile of refuse or goods. These are stationary objects that occupy space on the roadside and could impact the navigable width of the lane. The ego vehicle will need to consider these objects when planning its path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image, so these categories do not need to be considered in this scenario."
