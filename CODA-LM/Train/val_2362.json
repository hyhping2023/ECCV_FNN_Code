Its considerable size and heavy load can affect its maneuverability and braking distance. Ego car should maintain a safe following distance to allow ample time for reaction if the truck slows down or stops suddenly. Additionally, the width and operational nature of this vehicle may limit visibility for the ego car; thus, extra caution is advised when attempting to overtake or drive near it.",
