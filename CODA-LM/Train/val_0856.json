It is equipped with various mechanical parts and attachments that suggest its use in construction activities. The presence of this vehicle on the road requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and possibly prepare for unexpected stops or slow movement. Such a vehicle often moves slower than regular traffic, impacting the flow and causing potential delays, necessitating increased attention and cautious driving from the ego car.",
