The ego car will need to maintain safe following distances, adjusting speed and lane-keeping accordingly.

It is essential for the ego car to follow this sign to ensure it takes the correct route, especially if an exit needs to be taken or a specific direction followed.\n\nTraffic lights are not visible within the frame of the image, and the ego car should thus adhere to road signs and lane markings for navigation purposes.\n\nRed and white traffic cones line the right side of the road, indicating a worksite or obstruction and guiding traffic away from it. The ego car should maintain its current lane position and be ready for any changes in traffic flow.\n\nThere are also red plastic barriers on the right, signifying a closed lane or construction area. This requires the ego car to continue in its lane and stay alert for any possible activity in or around the construction area.\n\nAdditionally, a large green billboard is present to the left of the road, but it does not have any impact on roadway use or the ego car's driving behavior, although it should be noted for any potentially distracting content."
