In this driving scenario, the presence of the construction vehicle on the road ahead may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring a decrease in speed or a change in lane to maintain safe driving distance and ensure readiness to respond to unexpected stops or slow movement from the vehicle.",

Be prepared to adjust speed if the truck's brake lights come on. Keep an eye on the road ahead for any potential changes in road conditions, and remain vigilant for any signs or signals that could affect the driving environment. Since there is no visible traffic in the opposing lane, consider the possibility of overtaking if the truck's speed is significantly lower than the speed limit and it is safe to do so."
