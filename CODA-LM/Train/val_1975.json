A group of pedestrians is standing on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, meaning potential pedestrian crossings which require the ego car to monitor their movements closely and be prepared to stop. \n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the scene, indicating no light-controlled intersections influencing the immediate driving decisions of the ego car.
