Similarly, several cars are parked in a row on the right side, posing the same risk of hiding pedestrians or hazards from the ego car's view. Additionally, moving vehicles are observed in the opposite lane, traveling towards the ego vehicle, indicating a two-way traffic flow that necessitates the ego car to stay in its lane and monitor oncoming traffic. A motorcycle with a rider, also moving on the right side of the road in the same direction as the ego car, requires caution as motorcycles can quickly change lanes or speed.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, a cyclist is spotted on the right sidewalk, parallel to the parked cars, potentially entering the road unexpectedly. Pedestrians are also seen on both sides of the road, on the sidewalks, which means the ego car must remain vigilant to any pedestrian attempting to cross the road or stepping into the street.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, directional signs are visible over the road at the upcoming intersection, with arrows indicating lanes for going straight or making turns. This information is crucial for the ego car to make lane choices well in advance.\n\nTraffic cones are placed in a line, indicating a work zone or a closed area on the right side of the road, near the sidewalk. These cones signal to the ego car to avoid the area and stay in the open lane.\n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are mentioned in the data, suggesting that these categories do not contain relevant information for this particular traffic image."
