The presence of the bus is significant as it may affect traffic flow due to its size and potential stops for passengers, which could influence the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n- A dark-colored car is directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car, at a moderate distance. This car's behavior is important as it affects the ego car's following distance and speed. Any sudden actions by this car will require the ego car to react to maintain safety.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- Pedestrians are crossing the street to the right, with some already on the crosswalk. The ego car is required to yield to them for safety reasons and to comply with traffic laws.\n- Cyclists and individuals on scooters are in the bike lane to the right, moving in the same direction as the ego car. These road users could potentially enter the ego car's travel lane, so vigilance is necessary to adapt speed or position if needed.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- A 'No Left Turn' sign is present on the left, along with other directional and informational signs above the road. These signs are critical for navigation and may limit certain driving maneuvers, such as prohibiting a left turn.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- The traffic light is green, allowing vehicles to proceed when the way is clear. The ego car can continue but must stay alert for other road users who might cross or share the road.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- A row of traffic cones on the left indicates a construction or closed-off area, reducing the width of the lanes. The ego car driver must be cautious to avoid entering the restricted area.\n\nOther Objects:\n- A parking sign with a 'P' symbol on the right side signifies a parking area. This suggests that vehicles might enter or exit parking spaces, potentially creating obstacles or causing the ego car to reduce speed.\n\nThere are no barriers present in the scene."
