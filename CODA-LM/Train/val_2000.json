Beyond the crane, a green truck is parked on the side of the road, not directly obstructing the lane but close enough to suggest the possibility of other stationary vehicles or unexpected traffic entries. Furthermore, a white truck is observed in the distance on the right side of the road, facing towards the ego car, either parked or preparing to merge into traffic, thus potentially affecting traffic dynamics.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or traffic cones are reported in this scenario, indicating a lesser focus on pedestrian or finer traffic management elements in this particular context.\n\nThe scene includes a traffic sign, specifically a blue and white striped sign before the mobile crane, indicating warnings of roadworks or changes in the road layout ahead. This serves as a caution for the ego car to prepare for potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lined barrier or a series of bollards in front of the parked green truck, next to the curb. This likely indicates a work zone or a section not to be accessed, guiding traffic away from the work zone and suggesting a restriction in road space which could influence navigational decisions.\n\nNo other objects are documented, focusing the attention on the described vehicles, signage, and barriers as primary influences on driving behavior within this scenario."
