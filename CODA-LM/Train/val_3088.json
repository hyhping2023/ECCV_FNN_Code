        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are two notable elements that directly influence driving behavior. Firstly, there is a traffic light mounted on a portable stand located approximately at the center of the intersection, which is currently displaying a green light. The presence of the green light signals that vehicles are permitted to proceed, provided it is safe to do so. However, the traffic light's unconventional positioning might lead to some confusion regarding the right of way, necessitating extra caution from drivers.\n\nSecondly, surrounding the traffic light stand, yellow and black portable barriers have been strategically placed to enhance the visibility of the temporary traffic setup and to signal caution. These barriers serve to clearly mark the area around the traffic light stand, indicating that it is either an area to avoid or one that should be approached with caution. This setup suggests a temporary alteration to the usual traffic flow, possibly due to construction or an event, and underscores the importance of vigilance in navigating the intersection safely."

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic light mounted on a post at a street intersection. The traffic light is displaying a green signal, indicating it is permissible for vehicles to proceed. Its role is to regulate the flow of traffic, reduce the risk of accidents, and ensure an orderly movement of vehicles through the intersection. The display of the green light informs the driver of the ego car that they can continue driving forward without needing to stop, as long as the intersection remains clear of other hazards.",

Remaining vigilant for any sudden changes in the traffic flow or further temporary instructions is also crucial given the possibly confusing traffic light arrangement."
