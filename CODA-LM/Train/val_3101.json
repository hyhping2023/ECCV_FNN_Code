This indicates that the right lane might be closing or narrowed, potentially affecting the available driving lanes for the ego vehicle. Moreover, temporary construction barriers with reflective elements are installed alongside the right edge of the driving lane. This suggests a work zone or lane closure is present, which could necessitate a reduced speed and a possible change in the available lanes for the ego vehicle. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects depicted in this image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

In this scene, the barrier is placed between traffic lanes or beside the road to prevent the ego car from veering into oncoming traffic or restricted zones.

It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and order on highways, especially in reducing the risk of head-on collisions and road departure accidents. The presence of this barrier influences the driving behavior of the ego car by clearly demarcating the boundary of the driving lane, thereby guiding the driver to stay within their designated lane and reducing the likelihood of unintentional lane departures.",
