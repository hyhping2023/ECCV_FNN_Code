The road contains a traffic sign, specifically a no parking sign located on the right side near the fence. This sign is essential for the ego car to note as it indicates that stopping or pulling over in that area is prohibited. Additionally, there are several orange traffic cones strategically placed in a row, indicating that part of the road is unavailable for use due to either ongoing road work or a pedestrian zone, which requires the ego car to maintain its lane and not cross into the restricted area. Furthermore, temporary fencing and barriers are set up on the right side of the road, signaling the presence of construction activities or areas that are off-limits, potentially affecting the usual traffic flow and necessitating increased caution from the ego car. There are no traffic lights or other objects of significance in the image."
