This vehicle is stationary due to the traffic light, and it is important for the ego car to keep an eye on it for any movement as the light changes.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple pedestrians, including a cyclist, crossing the road in front of the ego car, moving from left to right. The presence of these vulnerable road users in the crosswalk significantly affects the ego car's driving decisions, as it must wait for them to clear the crosswalk before proceeding.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there is a traffic light displaying a red signal. This red light requires the ego car and other vehicles in the same lane to remain stopped until it turns green.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car's lane, several traffic cones have been placed, reducing the width of the lane. These cones dictate that the ego car must stay within the narrowed lane space and not cross into the coned-off area.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."

The ego car should also watch for pedestrians who may be rushing to cross at the end of the signal, ensuring that they have safely cleared the crossing before proceeding."
