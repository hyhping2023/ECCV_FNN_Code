Due to the truck's size and proximity, the field of vision for the ego vehicle's driver is likely impaired. As a result, there is a need for more cautious and slower driving, ensuring a safe distance is maintained behind the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian crossing the road in front of the dump truck, moving from left to right. The presence of the pedestrian in the crosswalk means that the ego vehicle must be ready to stop to yield, depending on how the pedestrian proceeds and the current traffic signals.\n\nTo the side of the road, there's a traffic sign indicating an upcoming junction where drivers should give priority to traffic coming from the right. This sign alerts the ego vehicle to exercise caution for vehicles that may enter the junction from the right side.\n\nThe traffic light situation ahead of the dump truck shows a red signal for those proceeding straight and a green signal for turning left. This signals the ego vehicle to prepare to stop at the junction, as the current travel lane is subject to the red light.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

The driver should be wary of the pedestrian crossing the road and any potential vehicles approaching from the right at the junction. Given the wet road conditions, the driver should also adjust speed to ensure safe stopping distances."
