        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several vehicles and traffic lights present that can influence the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, a large, cylindrical tanker truck is in the left foreground occupying multiple lanes. It appears to be making a left turn. Due to its large size and position, the truck may obstruct the lines of sight and requires ample space to maneuver. As a result, the ego car should exercise caution and might need to stop or slow down to accommodate the truck's movements.\n\nAdditionally, a white van is positioned on the right side of the tanker truck, driving steadily in its lane. The ego car needs to monitor the van's trajectory to maintain a safe following distance. Behind the white van, there is a white sedan, which is following the traffic flow in a distinct lane. Although the sedan is adhering to normal traffic behavior, the ego vehicle should continue to observe its speed and direction for any unexpected changes.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic lights situated ahead, one for each lane. However, the current signal displayed by these lights can not be determined due to the photo's angle and glare. Regardless, the state of these traffic lights is critical as it dictates the traffic flow. The ego car must be ready to respond appropriatelyâ€”either to stop or proceed when the light's signal is recognized.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in this traffic scene."

            "description and explanation": "This is a large construction vehicle, specifically a cement truck, characterized by its cylindrical mixing drum at the back, which is used to mix concrete while in transit. The size and nature of the vehicle suggest that it may operate at slower speeds compared to typical road vehicles, and it might make frequent stops or sudden movements to align with construction sites. When driving near such a vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe distance to accommodate for its larger blind spots and the possibility of concrete or debris falling from the drum. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared for potential sudden stops or turns by the construction vehicle.",
