This truck is taking up a significant portion of the road, which may block the path ahead. As a result, the ego car must exercise caution and may need to alter its driving behavior to navigate around the truck safely.\n\nAdditionally, several motorcyclists are present on the road, visible in the background. Given that motorcyclists are considered vulnerable road users, the ego car must remain particularly vigilant and cautious to ensure their safety and prevent any potential accidents."

Its presence directly in front of the ego car must influence the driving behavior by ensuring a safe following distance is maintained. Since these types of vehicles can start and stop unpredictably, it's crucial for the ego vehicle to allow extra space for sudden stops, particularly important in urban traffic environments where such heavy vehicles can affect traffic flow and safety.",

Being a larger and longer vehicle, buses require more space to maneuver and can obscure sightlines to pedestrians and other vehicles. The future driving behavior of the ego vehicle should include cautious and proactive driving practices, such as increasing awareness of potential stops the bus may make for passengers, as well as ensuring that passes are executed safely without cutting into the bus's path unnecessarily.",

If possible, it may be advisable to change lanes or find an alternate route to avoid potential hazards or obstructions caused by the truck's presence in the middle of the road. Constant vigilance and defensive driving are recommended to ensure the safety of all road users."
