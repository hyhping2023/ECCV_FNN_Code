This parked sedan directly affects the navigable space available to the ego car and may require a lane change or maneuver to ensure safe passage. Additionally, there is a pedestrian accompanied by a dog walking along the right side of the road, in the same direction as the ego car's travel. The proximity of the pedestrian and dog to the carriageway may pose a risk if they inadvertently enter the road; therefore, the ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop to ensure safety. On the left side of the road, near the curb, there is a large red concrete mixer drum lying down. This object poses a potential hazard by narrowing the usable road width and could indicate the presence of nearby construction activity.

In traffic scenarios, dogs are unpredictable and may suddenly run onto the road, which requires drivers to be attentive and ready to stop or slow down to avoid a collision. The presence of a dog near the roadway significantly increases the need for cautious driving and may necessitate a reduction in speed, enhancing overall road safety.",
