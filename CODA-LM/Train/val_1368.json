A dark-colored compact car parked on the right-hand side, facing the ego vehicle. It is currently stationary and does not affect the traffic flow, but it should be monitored for any movement.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users:\n1. A pedestrian is walking along the roadside opposite the ego car. This pedestrian might attempt to cross the street, which could affect the ego car's driving path.\n2. A small dog is standing in the middle of the road in front of the ego car. The animal represents a potential hazard and could impact the ego car's travel route.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones:\n1. A series of orange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, extending towards the pedestrian. They likely indicate a roadwork or construction zone, so the ego car will need to reduce speed and possibly change lanes.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image."
