There are several parked cars lining the right side of the road; this situation necessitates vigilance as it may obscure pedestrians stepping onto the roadway or car doors suddenly opening. Also present on the road is a white car traveling in the same direction as the ego car, occupying the adjacent left lane. Care must be taken to monitor this car since it could potentially change lanes.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are individuals on the sidewalk near the crosswalk, which raises the possibility of them deciding to cross the street and thus requires readiness from the ego car to stop if necessary. Additionally, there is a motorcyclist moving in the same lane and direction as the ego car. Extra caution and distance are advisable due to the inherent stability and visibility issues associated with motorcycles.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there is a pedestrian crossing sign located on the right side of the road, just before a zebra crossing, alerting drivers to the potential presence of pedestrians crossing and suggesting the need for a more cautious approach.\n\nLastly, within the scene is a parking sign indicating a parking zone on the right side of the street, confirming that the lined cars are parked legally and hinting that the area may have higher activity with vehicles maneuvering in and out of parking spots.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are reported in this particular traffic image."
