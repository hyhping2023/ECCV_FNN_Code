Directly in front of the ego car, within the same lane, is a silver hatchback. It is either stationary or moving slowly, and consequently, the ego car must be ready to adjust its speed or come to a halt based on this vehicle's behavior. Alongside, in the left adjacent lane, there is a blue sedan traveling in the same direction. The presence of the sedan necessitates that the ego car stay vigilant for any potential lane shifts or changes in the sedan's speed. In the far right lane, a gray SUV is also moving in the same direction and should be observed by the ego car for any lane-changing intentions, particularly towards the center lane. Further ahead in the left lane, there is a white bus stopped at a bus stop which could potentially conceal pedestrians and may re-enter the traffic flow abruptly, requiring the ego car to adjust its driving strategy.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a 'No Right Turn' sign at the intersection on the right which instructs the ego car not to turn right at that point. Overhead directional signs indicate that the left-most lane is dedicated to left turns, while the other lanes are meant for proceeding straight. This guidance aids the ego car in choosing the correct lane for its intended journey.\n\nThe traffic lights present include a green light for the lane the ego car is in, allowing it to continue if the road is clear. Simultaneously, there is a red light for the left turn lane, meaning the ego car should not be in that lane as turning left is currently prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, there are temporary fencing and barriers on the right side of the road, signaling ongoing construction work that the ego car should approach with caution due to possible hazards or workers near the traffic lanes.\n\nThe data provided does not indicate the presence of any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects in the current traffic image."
