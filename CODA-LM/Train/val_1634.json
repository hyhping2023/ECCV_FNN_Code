        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a heavy truck directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. The truck is carrying construction equipment, and it appears to be actively used at a construction site, as evidenced by the visible dirt on the vehicle. Due to the heavy load, the truck is likely to move at a slower pace and might stop suddenly or drop debris, which calls for an increased following distance for safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are cars in the adjacent lanes to the left. Notably, a white car is ahead and is attempting to merge into the ego car's lane. This situation requires the ego car to stay alert to the potential of the white car cutting into its path, necessitating a possible reduction in speed or a lane change if it's safe to execute.\n\nThe traffic also includes a set of traffic lights, where the green light is currently illuminated. This signals that the vehicles are allowed to proceed. Nonetheless, drivers must remain cautious as the traffic conditions could change rapidly if the light were to change, potentially causing traffic to slow down or come to a stop.\n\nLastly, there are temporary construction barriers situated on the right side of the road. These barriers imply that there is ongoing road work. They take up part of the lane or shoulder, potentially affecting the flow of traffic. As a result, the ego car needs to keep a safe distance from these barriers to navigate the restricted road space safely."
