The first is a white passenger car located in the lane directly in front of the ego vehicle, which seems to be stationary or moving at a slow pace as indicated by the visible brake lights. This vehicle significantly affects the driving decisions of the ego car, as it necessitates keeping a safe following distance.\n\nFurther down the road, in the same lane as the ego car, there is a bus that appears to be stopped at a bus stop. Its presence suggests potential movement among passengers, and this calls for the ego car to stay alert and be prepared for pedestrians that might step onto the driving path as they move to and from the bus.\n\nOn the sidewalks, two vulnerable road users are detected. On the left side, a pedestrian is moving parallel to the road, not directly interfering with the ego car's immediate route, yet their proximity to the road means their movements should be continuously observed. On the right side, there's a person walking a dog near parked vehicles, heading away from the ego car's lane. Despite not being on the road, their closeness to the driving lane warrants cautious driving and preparedness to stop if necessary.\n\nA single traffic sign can be seen â€“ a blue directional sign located above the left sidewalk. It presents directions for traffic but has no direct impact on the immediate driving actions of the ego car.\n\nThe image includes orange traffic cones placed on the right of the ego car, signaling a work zone or other hazards on the roadside. Therefore, the ego car is advised to stay in its lane and not drift towards the area marked by the cones to avoid any hidden or upcoming obstacles.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in the image data provided."
