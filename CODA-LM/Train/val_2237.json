Most notably, a red car facing the ego vehicle is parked closest on the right side. The presence of these parked vehicles considerably reduces the usable width of the roadway for the ego vehicle, potentially blocking the view of other road users, which necessitates cautious driving.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian on the right sidewalk, described as an adult dressed in dark clothing who is pushing a red stroller. This pedestrian's proximity to the driving path of the ego vehicle signifies a potential risk, as they might cross the street. It is crucial for the ego vehicle to remain vigilant and be ready to stop or yield to ensure safety. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the image."
