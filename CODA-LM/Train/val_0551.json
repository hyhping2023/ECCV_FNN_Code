There are pedestrians on both sides of the street, positioned behind barriers, appearing not to intend to enter the roadway, but their presence requires monitoring. A cyclist is also seen on the right side, beyond a barrier, riding away from the traffic, presenting no immediate hazard but still meriting awareness.\n\nIn terms of traffic regulations, a 'no entry' sign is directly in the path of the ego car, accompanied by signs indicating no bicycles, motorcycles, or tricycles allowed, clearly stating that the road ahead is closed to all forms of traffic, impacting the ego car's ability to continue forward. Temporary barriers are also set up on both sides of the roadway, demarcating a section specifically for pedestrians and indicating a controlled area or event that vehicles must respect by avoiding the closed-off section."
