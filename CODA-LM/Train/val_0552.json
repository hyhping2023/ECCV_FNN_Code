On the left, we see a blue compact car traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The close proximity of this car might impact the ego vehicle's ability to change lanes or perform other maneuvers. Further ahead on the right, a silver sedan is parked. This vehicle narrows the available driving space and could create a hazard if it were to suddenly begin moving.\n\nDirectly in front of the ego vehicle is a white SUV, also moving in the same direction. The ego vehicle will need to monitor the SUV's speed and movements while ensuring a safe following distance is maintained.\n\nAdding to the driving complexity, there is a cyclist wearing a white shirt on the left edge of our lane, going the same way. It's crucial for the ego vehicle to keep a safe distance when overtaking the cyclist. On the sidewalks along the road, pedestrians are present, posing a risk of unpredictably stepping onto the road, hence, requiring the ego vehicle's attention.\n\nThere's also a pedestrian crossing sign on the right, hinting at a possible crossing ahead. This alerts the ego vehicle to be ready to yield to pedestrians if needed.\n\nOn the right of the ego vehicle's lane, a series of traffic cones guide traffic away from the sidewalk, restricting the driving space and underlining an area to steer clear of.\n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are reported in this image, streamlining the factors the ego vehicle must account for while navigating the scene."

Buses are key components of urban and suburban public transport systems and have dedicated travel patterns and stopping routines that can influence traffic flow.
