This placement suggests the ego car may need to adjust its speed or prepare to stop depending on the SUV's actions. Additionally, a silver car is observed in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, appearing to proceed straight ahead. While this car's trajectory won't likely influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions, it should be monitored in case of sudden lane changes or braking.\n\nThere is also a directional arrow on the road indicating the right-hand lane is for turning right. This sign informs the ego car about lane usage, suggesting that if the ego car is in the right lane, it should prepare to turn right. Furthermore, a red traffic light is visible ahead for the lane the ego car is in, requiring it to stop behind the stop line or the vehicle in front until the light turns green.\n\nA single traffic cone is present to the right of the ego car, located next to a damaged section of the road surface. This indicates a hazard on the road that should be avoided, possibly suggesting a slight shift to the left in the lane if space allows."

If the ego car is in the right-hand turn lane, it should also prepare to make a right turn once the traffic light turns green and it is safe to do so."
