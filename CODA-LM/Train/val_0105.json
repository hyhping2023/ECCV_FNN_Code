        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several elements to note that affect the behavior of the ego car. Firstly, there is a silver sedan directly in front of the ego car, positioned in the middle of the right lane. It appears to be either moving forward or at a complete stop. The presence of this sedan requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance since it dictates the immediate flow of traffic for the ego car. Additionally, there is a bus parked on the right side of the road, within a designated bus stop, showing no indication of movement. This necessitates caution from the ego car regarding potential pedestrians around the bus and the possibility of the bus re-entering traffic. Also observed are vehicles in the opposite lane. While they do not directly affect the ego car's driving behavior at the moment, they warrant monitoring as they could influence traffic patterns or inadvertently cross the median, emphasizing the importance of situational awareness.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other observable objects that affect driving behavior in this scenario.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there are yellow pedestrian crossing signs on both sides of the road, signaling the presence of a marked crosswalk ahead. This mandates that the ego car should be prepared to yield to any pedestrians that may be crossing or about to cross the road. Additionally, directional signs are located to the right of the road, pointing out parking areas and possibly points of interest. Although these signs are primarily informative and don't require immediate action, they signify areas where pedestrians might be found, suggesting a need for vigilance.\n\nLastly, red and yellow traffic cones are observed to the right of the ego car's lane, indicating a narrowing of the lane or potentially signaling a hazard ahead. This requires the ego car to avoid these cones and remain alert for any road works or changes in the lane structure that may arise."
