        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene described, the ego car is positioned behind a sedan directly ahead in the same lane. The sedan's brake lights are on, which indicates that it is slowing down or coming to a stop. As a result, the ego car must be prepared to reduce its speed or stop to maintain safety. Ahead, there are multiple vehicles in adjacent lanes and crossing the intersection, some with tail lights on, signifying active traffic dynamics that require continuous monitoring by the ego car for any potential impact on its path.\n\nTo the left of the ego car, a cyclist is moving across the intersection, on the edge of the crosswalk. The presence of the cyclist necessitates cautious driving from the ego car to anticipate any sudden movements, as they can be unpredictable and are more vulnerable than vehicle occupants. Additionally, there are pedestrians on both sides of the intersection who are close to the crosswalk and may step onto the road. This situation demands that the ego vehicle remains vigilant and be prepared to yield to pedestrians.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic scene also includes a traffic light with a green right turn arrow, positioned above the intersection slightly to the left, suggesting the right-hand lane is clear for vehicles to make a turn. This information is beneficial if the ego car intends to turn right. Directly in front of the ego car, there is a standard green traffic light signal, allowing it to proceed through the intersection as long as the way is clear and it is in the correct lane for its intended route.\n\nLastly, a set of traffic cones is placed to the right side of the ego car, narrowing the lane width. This requires the ego vehicle to steer clear of the cones and maintain a safe position within the reduced space of the current lane to avoid any safety hazards or issues with ongoing road work.\n\nThere are no road users classified as barriers or other objects reported in this scene."
