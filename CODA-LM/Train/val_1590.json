These include white and red cars that are positioned parallel to the curb. The presence of these parked vehicles reduces the width of the drivable road space and creates potential hazards, such as if car doors are opened suddenly or pedestrians emerge unexpectedly from between the vehicles.\n\nThere is also a moving car in the distance on the same side as the ego car but in the opposite lane, heading towards the ego car. This oncoming vehicle requires careful monitoring, particularly in the event of any overtaking maneuvers.\n\nA pedestrian is observed on the sidewalk to the right near the parked vehicles, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Due to the close proximity to the road, there is a possibility that the pedestrian may enter the road unexpectedly, which would require the ego car to be prepared to stop or slow down swiftly.\n\nA metal barrier is situated on the left side of the road, separating it from the adjacent pedestrian area. This barrier serves to guide the flow of traffic and prevents any deviation of the ego car onto the pedestrian side, maintaining a clear separation.\n\nLastly, there's a red public telephone booth on the sidewalk to the right with an individual inside it. While the phone booth and the individual inside are not on the vehicle's path, they signal potential pedestrian activity that may affect the driving environment."
