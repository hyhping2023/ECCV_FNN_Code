Our driving behavior should adapt to its speed and maintain a safe following distance. In addition, there's a dark-colored SUV parked on the left side of the road, facing the opposite direction. We must be cautious around the parked SUV in case its doors open or it unexpectedly enters the traffic flow.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, there's a pedestrian wearing a red top walking away from the road. Although the pedestrian is not posing an immediate risk, vigilance is required to quickly respond if they decide to cross the street or move unpredictably onto the road.\n\nTo the left, there is a red circular traffic sign that suggests 'No Entry' for any vehicles entering from that side road, which helps to lower the chances of vehicles unexpectedly joining the main road from that junction.\n\nLastly, metal plates present on the road indicate ongoing construction or repairs. As metal surfaces can be slippery, particularly in wet conditions, the ego car should approach these with caution and reduce speed, ensuring to pass over them safely without abrupt steering inputs or maneuvers. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image."

Observe any traffic entering from the 'No Entry' side road, although it is unlikely. Decrease speed and drive defensively, given the current road conditions and potential hazards."
