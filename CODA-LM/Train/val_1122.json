This truck, marked with reflective warning stripes and a rotating drum, occupies the central lane and appears to be moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Due to its size and potential for sudden movements, the concrete mixer truck requires the ego car to maintain close attention and adapt its driving behavior accordingly. Secondly, a white compact car is partially visible in the right lane and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. This car runs parallel with the ego vehicle and may be in a blind spot, which impacts the ego car's decisions regarding potential lane changes to the right."

The presence of such a vehicle on the road often signifies nearby construction activity. Due to its size and function, the construction vehicle might move slower than other traffic and might make sudden stops to align with construction sites. Ego vehicle must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential unexpected maneuvers by the construction vehicle.",
