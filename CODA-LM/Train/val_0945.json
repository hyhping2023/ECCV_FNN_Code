This truck occupies a different lane but moves in the same direction as the ego car, potentially obstructing its ability to overtake.\n  - A blue car is stopped directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights on, suggesting it is either slowing down or completely stopped. This vehicle directly impacts the ego car’s speed and stopping distance, necessitating a reduced speed or a complete stop.\n\n- **Barriers:**\n  - A concrete barrier is present on the right side, separating oncoming traffic lanes from those heading in the same direction as the ego car. This barrier limits right turns, prevents overtaking via oncoming lanes, and increases the risk of side collisions if the ego car drifts too close.\n\n- **Other Objects:**\n  - Construction materials and debris are visible on the side of the road and possibly near the road’s edge close to the ego car’s lane. These objects suggest ongoing construction work ahead or potential road hazards, necessitating cautious driving and possible avoidance actions."
