It's important to note that the truck is in motion, which heightens the need for cautious driving due to the potential for debris to be discharged from the truck or abrupt changes in its speed. To maintain safety, it is advised to keep a vigilant eye on the truck and ensure there is a sufficient following distance. No other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a truck that seems to be transporting a cement mixer. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road indicates that there may be nearby construction activity. For the ego car, this means there could be possible delays, detours, or the sudden slowing of traffic. Cautious driving and increased awareness are required, particularly if the construction vehicle makes frequent stops or merges back into traffic.",
