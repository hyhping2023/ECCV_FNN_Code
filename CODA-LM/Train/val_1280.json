It is facing the direction of the ego car and appears to be motionless. The presence of the forklift necessitates vigilance as there is a possibility that it could commence movement or make a turn, thereby posing a potential hazard that the ego vehicle must be prepared to react to.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the roadway ahead. This sign indicates that there is likely a crosswalk area in the vicinity, which means that the ego car needs to approach the area carefully and be prepared to come to a stop if pedestrians are detected.\n\nMoreover, there are yellow bollards noticed at the corner on the right side, which appear to be demarcating a separation between different parts of the road or safeguarding a particular area. The ego car is advised to keep a safe distance from these barriers to prevent any collisions and should refrain from crossing into the delineated space. \n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that would impact the ego car's driving decisions."
