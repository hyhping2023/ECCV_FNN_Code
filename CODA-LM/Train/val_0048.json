Firstly, a white SUV is directly in front of the ego vehicle, stationary at the intersection with brake lights on, necessitating the ego car to stop since they share the same lane and are approaching a traffic signal. Additionally, a silver sedan is in the right lane, progressing forward but preparing to halt due to a red traffic signal ahead, a situation which the ego car needs to monitor to gauge the overall flow of traffic and to determine if a lane change is required.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users, including cyclists in the bicycle lane to the right of the ego car. Their presence requires the ego vehicle's attention for any potential right turns or lane changes to assure their safety. Furthermore, pedestrians are waiting at the crosswalk on the intersection's right side, signaling the need for the ego car to be ready to yield if the pedestrians start to cross when the light changes.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, the one directly in front of the ego vehicle is red, indicating that the ego car must stop and await a green signal to continue onward safely.\n\nOther objects, such as fixed structures including traffic light poles in the vicinity of the intersection, are also noted. The ego car must be aware of these structures to avoid them when making turns.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers were mentioned in the data, suggesting their absence in the traffic image."
