A white SUV is noticed traveling in the opposite direction in its lane, which requires attention from the ego car since oncoming vehicles have the potential to cross into the opposing lane. Additionally, there's a bus ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, heading in the same direction. The bus affects the ego car's ability to maintain regular speed, as the ego car will have to be prepared to either slow down or change lanes to bypass the bus.\n\nA single traffic cone is also present on the edge of the road in the right lane ahead. The traffic cone indicates a need for caution, as it could be a sign of road work or other hazards ahead. The ego car may need to prepare for a lane change if the path is obstructed or if the road narrows.\n\nThe image apparently does not include any vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists or motorcyclists, nor are there any traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present. Hence, these categories can be disregarded in this context."

Overtaking the bus should be done with care only if the left lane is clear and it's safe to do so. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the oncoming white SUV until it has passed by safely."
