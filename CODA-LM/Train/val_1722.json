Although it's not a traffic sign, its position in the driver’s peripheral vision means it should be distinguished from actual traffic signs that convey critical information.\n\n**Traffic Cones:**\n- Orange and white traffic cones are placed in a line on the right side of the road, extending towards the background and marking a section. These cones indicate possible roadwork or lane closures ahead, requiring the ego car to maintain its lane position and be alert for potential obstructions.\n\n**Barriers:**\n- Concrete barriers are placed beside the traffic cones on the right side, separating the work zone from the road. These barriers indicate lane narrowing or a construction area, necessitating slower speeds and increased caution from the ego car.\n\n**Other Objects:**\n- Green mesh fencing runs along the left side of the road, indicating a boundary or protected area which may host construction or other activities.
