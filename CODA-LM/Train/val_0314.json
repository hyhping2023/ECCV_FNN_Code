This presence of the bus suggests a potential obstruction to the lane or possible maneuvers that could influence the path of the ego vehicle. Additionally, two traffic signs are visible on the right side. The first is a parking sign, indicating an area for parking, which, while it doesn't directly impact the ego vehicle's immediate path, provides important environmental context. The second sign is a blue circular sign marked with a red border and a white bar in the center, signifying no entry to a certain area, possibly indicating a restricted area or road closure that the ego vehicle must navigate around.\n\nMoreover, a formation of orange traffic cones is noted on the right side of the road. These cones are arranged diagonally, guiding traffic away from the roadside, hinting at a possible road obstruction or work zone. It is suggested that the ego vehicle maintains its lane to avoid this potential hazard. No vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are observed in this image, indicating that their presence or any related hazards they might present are not a current concern."
