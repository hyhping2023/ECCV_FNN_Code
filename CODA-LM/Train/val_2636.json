This requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to any sudden braking or lane changes by the other car. Additionally, traffic cones are visible on the road, likely indicating construction or maintenance work ahead. This necessitates that the ego vehicle proceeds with caution, be prepared to change lanes, or slow down if necessary due to potential lane closures or obstructions. Barriers or guardrails are also visible on both sides of the road, serving to define the boundaries of the roadway and prevent vehicles from veering off. The ego vehicle should remain within the lane markings and maintain a safe distance from these barriers. Finally, there are streetlights and power lines visible along the road. While these objects are common roadside infrastructure and do not directly impact driving behavior, their presence should be noted for situational awareness."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used to signal temporary traffic changes or hazards on the road. It is usually bright orange with a reflective stripe to increase visibility. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone on the roadway likely indicates an area that should be avoided, perhaps due to road work or an obstacle. The ego car should adjust its path to maintain a safe distance from the cone, possibly by changing lanes if it is safe to do so, or by reducing speed while passing near the cone to ensure safe navigation around the potential hazard.",

It is bright orange and conical in shape, strategically placed to signal alterations in traffic patterns or to demarcate specific areas that may be hazardous or off-limits for vehicular access. In this scenario, the traffic cone is used to indicate that the lane it occupies is temporarily closed or unsafe for vehicles. Its presence means that the ego car, along with other traffic, must merge or shift away from this lane to ensure safety and smooth traffic flow, adhering to potential reroutes or lane adjustments.",

The dry road surface allows for normal driving conditions, but caution should still be exercised in case of any unexpected obstructions or changes in road conditions."
