There are no vehicles in the vicinity, but there are vulnerable road users presentâ€”the image shows a cyclist ahead on the right side, moving in the same direction as our car. It's important to keep a safe distance from the cyclist since they may change their speed or direction. Additionally, pedestrians are seen walking along both sides of the street, and although they're not on the road, there's a chance they might step onto it, which requires our vigilance to avoid any potential incidents.\n\nWhile there are no specific traffic signs giving directions or imposing restrictions, the standard traffic rules applicable to this type of road and area should be followed. Similarly, no traffic lights are in sight, indicating that the car must rely on road markings and signs to navigate and coordinate with other road users safely.\n\nOther elements in the scene include various objects like dustbins and parked scooters on the sidewalk. These aren't immediately threatening to the ego vehicle's path as they're off the roadway, but they should still be kept an eye on to ensure they don't present any future hindrances. Notably, there are no traffic cones or barriers in this particular image."
