        "description and explanation": "The image shows several significant road users that could potentially influence driving behavior. Firstly, there is a large yellow tow truck positioned in the right-most lane, adorned with red and white caution markings and carrying construction equipment on its back. This tow truck is critical as it occupies a lane and may abruptly slow down or stop, affecting the traffic flow. As a result, the ego car might need to slow down or change lanes to avoid any disruption.\n\nAdditionally, a white sedan is spotted driving in the middle lane, parallel to the ego car. The presence of the sedan is noteworthy because it could impact the ego car's ability to change lanes if necessary, due to its close proximity and speed. \n\nApart from vehicles, there are also traffic bollards located at the side of the road near the crosswalk. These bollards are crucial even though they don't directly influence the ego car's trajectory since they are off the roadway. They signify areas where vehicles are restricted from passing, pointing towards restricted access zones that need to be recognized.\n\nNo other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers, were observed in the image, suggesting less complexity in those aspects at this particular moment."

If a lane change is needed, signal early and perform the maneuver safely, ensuring sufficient gap in the adjacent lane. The ego car should monitor the road for any unexpected changes and adhere to traffic rules that may not be visible in the image, such as speed limits and upcoming traffic signals."
