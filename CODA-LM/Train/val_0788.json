The presence of this truck directly influences the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, requiring the driver to maintain a safe following distance. Considering the size and reduced maneuverability of trucks, the ego car's driver should be prepared for potentially slower responses to traffic signals and changes, and possibly wider turns by the truck.",

Monitor the truck's brake lights for any indication of sudden stops and be prepared to respond. Keep within your lane, being mindful of the metal barriers to the left which constrict lane-changing options. Since there are no visible traffic lights or signs in the image provided that give specific instructions, default road safety practices should be followed."
