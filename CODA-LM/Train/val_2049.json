On the right side of the road, there is a partially visible larger vehicle, possibly a bus or truck, stopped under a gate structure with a blue sign. This large stopped vehicle suggests potential merging or crossing traffic that the ego car should be cautious of.\n\nSeveral traffic signs are observed: one is a blue informational sign over the road, likely indicating the name of the place or type of checkpoint, which provides information without directly affecting driving decisions but indicates that the ego car is approaching a controlled area such as a toll booth or checkpoint. Additionally, a circular 'no parking' sign with a red border and blue background is seen on the right side of the road, indicating that stopping or parking is not allowed in this area, a rule the ego car must follow.\n\nA traffic light is visible above on the far side of the gate structure showing a green light, signaling that the ego car is permitted to proceed but must remain alert to any changes or nearby traffic.\n\nLastly, three red and white traffic cones are lined up on the right side of the road, indicating that the right side lane or area is closed off. This means the ego car should stay in its current lane."
