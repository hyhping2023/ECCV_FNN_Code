The ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle and be prepared to react to its actions.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, a pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk to the right, parallel to the ego car. While this pedestrian is not immediately affecting the lane, they should be monitored in case they decide to cross the road or enter the driving lane. Furthermore, two individuals are standing by a parked car on the right sidewalk, with one bending over as if engaging with a stroller or a similar object. These individuals are close to the driving lane and should be considered potential hazards if they or the stroller unexpectedly enter the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this traffic image."

Be prepared to maneuver safely around the parked taxi without entering the opposite lane, ensuring not to compromise the safety margins."
