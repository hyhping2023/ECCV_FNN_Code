This van is not affecting the ego car's lane and thus does not have an immediate impact on its driving behavior. Additionally, multiple parked scooters and bicycles are located to the right side of the ego car. Some of these are partially obstructing the bike lane but not the car's lane. While these parked vehicles do not directly influence the ego car's current driving path, they should be monitored in case any start to move into the car's lane.\n\nVulnerable road users observed in the scene include cyclists and motorcyclists riding in the designated bike lane to the right of the ego car. They are maintaining their lane without deviations, requiring careful observation due to their proximity and potential to change direction or enter the vehicle lane. Pedestrians are also present on the sidewalk by the roadside. None are close to the carriageway or showing intentions to cross, posing no immediate risk but necessitating monitoring should any decide to cross the road suddenly.\n\nLastly, other objects in the scene include tree branches overhanging above the street. These provide shade but do not obstruct the road. The overhanging branches do not impact the driving behavior, but care should be taken in case of falling debris.\n\nThis summary encapsulates the presence and implications of various road users and objects in the traffic scene, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation by the ego car to ensure safe navigation."
