            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be large, circular industrial spools, likely used for storing materials like cables or wires. Each spool has a robust structure, designed to handle significant weights of whatever material is wound around it. In the context of driving, these spools don't pose a direct influence on the immediate behavior of the ego car if they remain stationary and off the road. However, their presence suggests an industrial area where large vehicles or machinery might be operating nearby. Consequently, a driver should remain alert for heavy vehicle traffic and possibly reduced visibility due to industrial activities.",

In an industrial environment, these objects are significant due to their bulk and weight. For the ego car, which is the driver's perspective, this object is located off the main roadway and within an industrial setting, serving as an indication that the area may have heavy machinery moving or other vehicle activities associated with industrial operations. The driver should remain alert for industrial trucks that might enter or exit the roadway nearby or other movements related to workplace operations.",
