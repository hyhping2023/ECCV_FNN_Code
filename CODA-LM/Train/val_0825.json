The presence of this construction vehicle in a driving scenario typically indicates that there might be road work ahead or nearby. It requires that drivers remain vigilant and possibly prepare to adjust their speed or follow alternative routing instructions, adhering to any road signs that are placed to manage traffic flow around the construction site.",

Cyclists share the road with motor vehicles but can be more vulnerable due to their smaller size and lack of protection compared to cars. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include increasing the following distance, reducing speed when approaching the cyclist, and being prepared to manoeuvre carefully to avoid close proximity, especially in lanes shared with cyclists. Safe driving etiquette calls for giving cyclists sufficient space when overtaking them.",
