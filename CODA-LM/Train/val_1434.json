        "description and explanation": "The image in view illustrates a traffic scene with various road users. On the right side of the road, there are several cars parked parallel to the curb, which likely reduce the available road width and may conceal any pedestrians or potential hazards from view. Additionally, there is a yellow vehicle, which could be a taxi or a service vehicle, positioned in the middle of the road and facing the ego car. This vehicle has its hazard lights activated, suggesting it might be engaged in dropping off or picking up passengers. This could result in doors opening suddenly or pedestrians unexpectedly stepping into the roadway.\n\nMoreover, there is a dog standing still in the center of the road directly ahead of the ego car. The stationary nature of the animal presents an unpredictable risk, as it may move abruptly, endangering itself and potentially obstructing the path of the ego car.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, running parallel to the parked cars, pedestrians are present. The vicinity of the pedestrians to the road carries a potential risk of them entering the roadway, a risk which increases if they are attempting to interact with the passengers or the driver of the stopped yellow vehicle.\n\nIn this scene, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported, thus these elements do not factor into the driving conditions."

Monitor the behavior of pedestrians on the right sidewalk to anticipate any potential road entry, especially near the stopped yellow vehicle. Maintain a safe distance from the parked cars on the right to avoid doors being opened into traffic. Given the road conditions that suggest wetness or ice, increase following distances and apply smooth and gradual inputs to brakes, steering, and acceleration."
