However, there are vulnerable road users observed. Specifically, there is one dog spotted on the left side of the road, facing in a direction as if it might cross the road; caution is advised since the dog could pose a potential hazard if it decides to move across the road unexpectedly. Additionally, there is one person walking on the right side of the road, going in the same direction as the ego car. While this pedestrian is not considered a direct threat at the moment, attention should be maintained in case their walking path changes or intersects with the vehicle's trajectory."

In traffic scenarios, dogs can be unpredictable and may suddenly enter the roadway, posing potential hazards. The presence of this dog requires the ego car to drive cautiously, maintain a lower speed, and be prepared to stop or maneuver gently to avoid a collision, ensuring both the safety of the animal and the vehicle occupants.",
