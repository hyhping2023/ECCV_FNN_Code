However, the ego car should be prepared for the light to change as it approaches the intersection.\n\nThere is a temporary barrier on the right side of the ego car's lane, suggesting some form of road work or lane closure. This barrier requires vehicles to maintain their lane positioning and possibly merge away from the closed lane.\n\nFinally, there is strong glare from streetlights and reflections on the wet road surface, resulting in low visibility conditions and a potentially slippery surface. This situation necessitates increased caution and possibly reduced speed for the ego car."
