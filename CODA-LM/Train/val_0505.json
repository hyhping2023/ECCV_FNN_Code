Additionally, a blue car is noticed further ahead in the second lane from the right, traveling in the same direction, and its behavior should be monitored to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nA couple of traffic signs are also visible; on the right side before the intersection, a blue directional sign indicates a turn for a destination and signals an imminent roundabout, informing the ego car about the approaching intersection and potential road merges or splits. After the intersection, a 'No Entry' sign is seen with arrow signs suggesting detour routes, directing that going straight is not an option and the ego car will need to follow the detour paths provided.\n\nNo vulnerable road users or traffic lights are present in this scene.\n\nOrange traffic cones are arranged diagonally across the intersection, creating a barrier from the center towards the right, which denotes a no-drive zone and suggests that the ego vehicle must avoid proceeding straight and instead adhere to the detour directions given by the road signs.\n\nMoreover, a temporary fence barrier on the right-hand side is blocking an area for construction, indicating disrupted traffic patterns and that vehicles are prohibited from entering this zone.\n\nThere are no other objects of relevance in the image."
