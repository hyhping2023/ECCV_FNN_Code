Additionally, there is a car in the right lane that has its red tail lights illuminated, which may indicate that it is slowing down or has stopped. It's important for the ego car to keep a safe following distance and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nThere are cyclists on the right-hand side of the road using the bike lane, necessitating caution from the ego car to avoid drifting into their path or passing too near. Also on the right is a pedestrian walking by the bike lane; they might cross the street or step into the vehicle's path, so the ego car must watch for their movements and be prepared to yield or stop.\n\nOver the road, there are signs indicating the directions of the lanes, which provide navigational help but don't influence immediate driving decisions. A blue sign with pedestrian and bike symbols indicates a shared path for pedestrians and cyclists, reminding the ego car to be cautious around these vulnerable road users.\n\nIn the distance, traffic lights show green, signaling the ego car to proceed if the traffic conditions permit, but with the knowledge that the lights may change. There are traffic cones on the right side of the road, signaling a work zone or lane blockage, which means the ego car has to stay within the lane markings while avoiding the coned-off area.\n\nIn this image, there are no barriers or other objects, such as debris or dustbins, on the road that would affect driving behavior."
