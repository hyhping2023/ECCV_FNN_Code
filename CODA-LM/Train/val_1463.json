This vehicle will influence the ego car's decision to proceed through the intersection as it may have the right of way depending on the traffic signal.\n2. A black car is visible behind the silver SUV, also waiting at the intersection. Similar to the SUV, this car is a factor for the ego car's movement through the intersection once the traffic signal allows.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users**:\n1. Multiple pedestrians are seen on the right side of the image, some appear to be waiting while others are crossing the street. Pedestrians have priority over vehicles, so their presence requires the ego car to ensure their safety and wait if necessary.\n\n**Traffic Signs**:\n1. A warning sign with red and white stripes on the right, indicating a no-entry or redirected traffic flow. This sign indicates that the ego vehicle should not enter certain areas and may have to follow detour routes.\n\n**Traffic Lights**:\n1. Traffic lights positioned above the intersection, all showing red. The red traffic signals require the ego car to stop at the intersection and not proceed until the lights change to green.\n\n**Traffic Cones**:\n1. Orange and white traffic cones are arranged in a line, guiding vehicles around a section of the intersection that may be a construction zone. The cones require the ego car to maneuver around the indicated area, likely altering its intended path through the intersection.\n\n**Barriers**:\n1. Blue and white barrier walls are placed to the right, cordoning off an area for construction or maintenance. These barriers narrow the available road space and likely contribute to the altered traffic flow; thus, the ego car must adjust its trajectory accordingly.\n\n**Other Objects**:\n1. A pile of construction materials or debris is seen on the right, behind the traffic cones. This suggests ongoing road works that will impact traffic flow, necessitating increased caution and potential detours for the ego car."
