Although they are not on the roadway, the ego car should be prepared to stop or slow down if they attempt to cross the road. There are no visible traffic signs, so no actions related to traffic signs are required. Similarly, there are no traffic lights visible in the image, hence no traffic lights are influencing driving decisions. Lastly, there is a small, unidentifiable object far ahead on the road. It is unlikely to affect driving behavior immediately, but maintaining awareness as the ego car approaches it is advisable."
