As for road infrastructure and signage, the image contains a line of orange and white traffic cones placed at intervals on the right side of the road. These cones form a line that tapers toward the ego car's lane and serve as a warning of a potential change in the road layout or a hazard area, possibly indicating construction or a closed lane ahead. There is also a metal fence with a large metal gate that is currently open, suggesting an entry point or boundary to a property, which may involve the risk of vehicles or pedestrians entering the road, although there seems to be no immediate activity. Additionally, within the view of the ego car are a street lamp and a decorative light fixture, which do not directly influence driving behavior but highlight the presence of a developed area and suggest that there may be more traffic or road users further along the road. There are no traffic signs or traffic lights captured in the image, and the remaining objects do not impact the driving scenario."
