This vehicle is large and slow-moving, and its positioning may force other vehicles to change lanes. Consequently, this could affect traffic flow and necessitate adjustments in the ego car's path or speed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars in the left and middle lanes traveling in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles are potential dynamic obstacles that the ego car will need to navigate around while maintaining a safe following distance.\n\nDirectional signs are visible on the side of the road. These signs provide information about upcoming routes and intersections, which the ego car may need to consider for navigation decisions.\n\nA median barrier is also present, separating opposite directions of traffic. This barrier restricts the ego car from crossing to the other side of the road and dictates that overtaking maneuvers must be made within the same direction lanes."
