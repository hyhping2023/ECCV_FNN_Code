        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a black sedan directly ahead in the same lane as the autonomous vehicle, both proceeding in the same direction. It is essential for the autonomous vehicle to keep a safe following distance from this vehicle. Additionally, there are various vehicles on the left side, which are separated by a barrier and moving in the opposite direction. These vehicles do not directly impact the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions since they are on the other side of the barrier, but they should still be kept under observation.\n\nOn the roadside, there is a group of pedestrians waiting at a bus stop to the right. There is no need for immediate action regarding these pedestrians since they are not on the roadway, however, the situation requires monitoring in case any of them enters the road unexpectedly.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a no-entry sign is posted on the left, denoting that the left-hand lane is not available for vehicles in the autonomous car's direction, which means the car must not enter that lane. There are also overhead directional signs indicating which lanes to use for specific destinations, which the autonomous vehicle needs to follow according to its intended route.\n\nTo assist with lane usage, there are traffic cones placed to the left of the autonomous vehicle's lane, indicating that the left lane is closed and signaling that the vehicle should continue in the current lane without veering left.\n\nFinally, the scene includes a continuous yellow and blue metal barrier that divides the opposite lanes of traffic, emphasizing the physical division between the autonomous vehicle's lane and those of oncoming traffic. The absence of both traffic lights and other objects in the scene indicates there are no such elements to consider in the current driving scenario."
