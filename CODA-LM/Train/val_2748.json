Similarly, no traffic signs or traffic lights are depicted, and there are no other miscellaneous objects, like debris or dustbins, visible within the scene. \n\nWhat stands out prominently are orange traffic cones arranged in a line, which seem to delineate a construction or no-entry zone directly ahead of the ego vehicle. The presence of these cones suggests that a section of the road ahead is likely closed off for traffic, possibly due to road work or another temporary obstruction. This configuration necessitates a change in the ego vehicle's path to avoid the restricted area, indicating that the driver must be aware and take action to alter their course accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, red and white barriers are partially visible, placed parallel to the traffic cones. These barriers further reinforce the delineation of a no-entry zone, signaling, much like the traffic cones, that a section of the road is not accessible to vehicles. The addition of these barriers strengthens the message that the ego vehicle should not proceed through this area, emphasizing the need for vigilance and adaptation in navigating the current road conditions."
