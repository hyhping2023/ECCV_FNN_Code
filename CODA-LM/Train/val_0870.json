The first vehicle is a large commercial vehicle, possibly a trailer, which is occupying the right lane and partially obstructing the left lane. It appears to be transporting heavy machinery. Due to its size and position, this vehicle may reduce visibility ahead for the ego vehicle and could potentially maneuver or slow down, requiring cautious driving. \n\nFollowing this, there is a white car parked on the right side of the road just past the commercial vehicle. The parked car is not directly blocking any lane, but the presence of the parked car should be noted as it could indicate that there might be more vehicles parked along the roadside, or that people might be disembarking from vehicles in this area, which would necessitate additional vigilance from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign in the scene, which is a round blue sign with a white arrow, mandating a turn to the right. This sign informs drivers that they must follow the road by turning right, which could mean the ego vehicle might need to make a lane change to comply with the indicated direction.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects described in this scene."
