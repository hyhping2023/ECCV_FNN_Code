Additionally, there is a yellow bus further ahead in the same left lane, which is important to consider because of its substantial size and the likelihood of making frequent stops that may impact the flow of traffic. Moreover, there is a white truck parked further to the left outside of the lanes for travel. It does not directly block the path, but it warrants vigilance for any unforeseen movement or doors opening.\n\nThe traffic image indicates an absence of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists; this affects the level of caution that must be exercised during driving.\n\nA traffic sign feature in the image is a blue circular sign located on the right, which specifies a lane for buses and bicycles only. This sign is essential as it instructs the autonomous car to avoid the far-right lane as it is reserved and helps in making the correct lane decision.\n\nFurthermore, there are red and white plastic barriers on the right side of the road, indicating the perimeter of a construction zone. These barriers are critical as they designate the drivable area and prevent the vehicle from entering the construction zone, ensuring the autonomous car remains within the legal driving boundaries.\n\nThe image does not include any traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects that would influence the autonomous car's driving behavior."
