The ego car must keep an appropriate distance and be ready to come to a halt if necessary. Additionally, there are several parked cars along the left side of the road and a bus moving ahead in the same direction. The ego car must monitor these vehicles, especially considering the potential for the bus to halt for passengers, possibly affecting traffic flow.\n\nOn the right side of our vehicle, there is a motorcyclist within the bike lane traveling in the same direction, prompting the necessity for the ego car to exercise caution when making right-side maneuvers and to maintain a safe berth. Furthermore, there are multiple cyclists further to the right in the designated bike area, also heading the same way. These cyclists must be taken into consideration to ensure their safety and the safe navigation of the ego car.\n\nOverhead, we see directional signs outlining the lane directions, with an adjacent sign indicating a straight or right turn lane. This guides the ego car on suitable lane choices up ahead. On the roadside, a blue circular sign denotes a dedicated bicycle path, forewarning of the potential presence of cyclists in the vicinity of the road.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, there are traffic cones and barriers marking the division between the bicycle lane and the car lane. These ensure that the ego car stays within its lane, avoiding the area reserved for cyclists. No traffic lights, additional barriers, or other objects are noted in this scene, suggesting clear passage without traffic signal controls or obstructive elements."
