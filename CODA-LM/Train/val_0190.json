This could pose a hazard as other vehicles might need to change lanes suddenly to evade it, leading to an increased risk of collision.\n   - Several cars are driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle across various lanes, showing no signs of erratic movements or lane changes currently. However, these vehicles need to be monitored as they could react to upcoming road conditions.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**: \n   - A blue circular sign positioned on the far left above the traffic light signals that making a left turn is allowed, influencing the driving route for vehicles, including the ego vehicle.\n   \n3. **Traffic Lights**: \n   - A traffic light with a red signal is seen at an intersection ahead, mandating that all vehicles, including the ego-car, stop at the intersection and wait until the light turns.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**: \n   - Two traffic cones on the right side of the road close to the curb suggest possible road works or another type of hazard. This setup may indicate a narrowing of the lane or an obstruction, necessitating drivers to exercise caution and possibly merge left if the right lane is blocked.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects are present in the image according to the data provided."
