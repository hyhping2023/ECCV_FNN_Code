The ego-vehicle needs to maintain a safe following distance from the van to be able to react to any sudden stops or turns.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are pedestrians walking away from the roadway. They are not currently affecting traffic but should be monitored in case any of them unexpectedly enters the roadway. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the right side, also riding away from the ego car and maintaining a straight path. The cyclist is not an immediate hazard but should be observed cautiously for any potential movements towards the lane.\n\nAbove the overpass, there is a directional sign pointing to the left, which could indicate an exit or a direction change. The ego-vehicle should be ready for possible traffic behavior changes, such as vehicles changing lanes or decelerating to take the exit.\n\nLastly, there is a civil works or construction site on the right, bordered by green netting and barriers. The site is not encroaching onto the roadway and should not influence current driving behavior, but it suggests there might be construction activity further ahead.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that affect the driving conditions for the ego car."
