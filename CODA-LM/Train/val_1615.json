The forklift may influence the flow of traffic and could become an obstacle for the ego car if it moves toward or operates near the driving lane.\n\nNear the forklift, there is a person donning a high-visibility vest, standing close to the road and looking away from the ego vehicle, possibly towards the forklift or another area of interest. Due to the pedestrian's proximity to the roadway and the unpredictability of their movements, the ego vehicle should be prepared to decelerate or halt to guarantee safety.\n\nOverhead, the traffic lights show green for the direction in which the ego vehicle is traveling, granting the right to proceed. Despite this, caution must be exercised due to the forklift's and pedestrian's presence.\n\nLastly, there are green net barriers positioned on the right side, demarcating a construction or work area along the road. These barriers indicate that the ego vehicle should stay vigilant for possible construction traffic, workers, or alterations in the road conditions."
