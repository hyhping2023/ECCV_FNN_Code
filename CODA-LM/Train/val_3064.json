        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals several road users of different categories. First, there is a white sedan on the left side directly ahead of the ego car, which could influence the ego car's maneuvering and acceleration due to its proximity. Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road in front of shops. These parked vehicles pose a potential risk if doors open or if pedestrians move between them, requiring increased alertness from the ego car.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist moving in the middle of the road directly in front of the ego car. This cyclist affects the ego car's driving path and necessitates careful observation for any sudden changes in speed or direction. Additionally, a pedestrian is walking near the parked cars on the right-hand side. This pedestrian could potentially step into the traffic lane unexpectedly, thus requiring the ego car to drive carefully and be ready to stop.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, a parking sign is visible on the right next to the line of parked cars. This sign indicates regulated parking areas and suggests the presence of pedestrians and vehicles that may enter or exit parking spots.\n\nThe image also shows concrete spherical barriers lined up along the side of the road, forming a boundary between the sidewalk and the road. These barriers help restrict vehicle movement into the pedestrian area, highlighting the importance of maintaining a safe distance.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects detected in this image."
