However, there is a notable traffic sign: an overhead blue sign indicating a junction ahead, possibly with other directional information. This sign is crucial as it indicates an upcoming point of potential traffic merging or diversion, which may require the driver to adjust speed and select the appropriate lane in anticipation of the junction.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange and white traffic cones positioned in a line, demarcating the right boundary of the driving lane. These cones are likely set up due to roadwork or lane redirection, serving as a visual guide for the ego vehicle to stay within the designated lane, ensuring safe navigation through the altered traffic pattern.\n\nFurthermore, yellow and red cylindrical barriers are placed on the left side of the road. These barriers serve a similar purpose to the traffic cones, indicating a no-entry zone or obstacles. They require the vehicle to maintain its course within the open lane, ensuring the safety of the vehicle and its surroundings by preventing accidental entry into hazardous or restricted areas.\n\nNo traffic lights, other objects, or additional road users are mentioned, indicating a focus on lane guidance and directional information in this specific traffic scenario."
