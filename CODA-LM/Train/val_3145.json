        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, the most notable road users categorized are vehicles. Specifically, there are two large, beige-colored dump trucks visible. These trucks are located on the right side of the image, occupying the opposite lane and facing the direction of the ego car, with the second truck directly behind the first one. The presence of these trucks in the opposite lane is significant for several reasons. Primarily, due to their probable slow movement and potential engagement in construction or material transportation activities, these trucks might need to execute wide turns or come to sudden stops. Furthermore, the size and positioning of the trucks could significantly obscure the visibility ahead for the ego car, making it crucial for the autonomous system to adjust its driving behavior accordingly to maintain safety. There are no other categories of road users, including vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, present in the image, suggesting a relatively clear path except for the mentioned trucks."

As an irregular, medium-sized rock, it could potentially influence the steering or passing decisions of vehicles, especially in narrower lanes. Drivers such as the one in the ego car might need to maneuver slightly to the left to avoid running over the stone, particularly if maintaining tire health is a concern or if the vehicle is low to the ground, to prevent potential undercarriage damage.",

Overtaking should be done with extreme caution, ensuring there is a clear view of the opposite lane and that there's sufficient space to pass safely. The ego car should also be cautious of the road surface conditions, which may affect traction."
