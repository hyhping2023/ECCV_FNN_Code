Consequently, the ego vehicle should be ready to decelerate or halt. There are no vulnerable road users present in the scene.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a street sign on the right indicating a speed limit of 20 km/h, which the ego vehicle must comply with for safety and to obey traffic laws. Additionally, there are blue parking signs on both sides of the road, which may denote parking zones and restrictions that the ego vehicle needs to consider while making driving decisions.\n\nThe traffic lights for the direction the ego vehicle is traveling are red, requiring the ego vehicle to stop and wait for the light to turn green before continuing.\n\nThere are no traffic cones in the image. However, there are barriers on the right side of the road, delineating a construction area from the traffic lane, signaling potential road work ahead. The ego vehicle should navigate this area with caution, possibly at a reduced speed, and be alert for any unforeseen obstacles.\n\nLastly, there are red and white portable barriers to the right, indicating a construction zone or a closed-off area. The ego vehicle should avoid this part of the road."
