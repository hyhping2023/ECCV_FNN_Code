        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are several road users and objects to be aware of:\n\nFor vehicles, there is a silver sedan located to the left of our vehicle, slightly ahead, which suggests the potential for lateral movement. As such, we should be prepared for any necessary braking or lane changes. Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a dark-colored SUV that is traveling in the same direction as our car. It is important to maintain a safe following distance with this vehicle and stay alert for any brake lights, signaling that it is slowing down or stopping. Additionally, there is a red vehicle in the lane to the left, which is parallel to the SUV and may potentially change lanes, requiring our vigilance.\n\nConcerning vulnerable road users, we have observed a group of cyclists who are currently stationary on the right side by the curb. This situation requires caution as they could unexpectedly enter the roadway. There are also several pedestrians located behind a bus stop on the right, who do not seem to intend to cross the street as they appear stationary. While they pose a low immediate risk, it is important to monitor their actions for any possible changes.\n\nOn the road, there are two orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the rightmost lane, indicating an obstruction in the lane. This may necessitate a lane shift to the left to continue safely.\n\nLastly, there is a bus stop situated on the right side along with buses and a shelter. This could potentially lead to buses pulling out into the lane of travel and requires that we approach this area with caution.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or barriers are reported in the image, indicating these elements are either not present or not pertinent in the specific road situation in the image."
