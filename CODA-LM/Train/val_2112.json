        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene presented, there are several notable elements impacting the road conditions for the self-driving car (ego car). Firstly, there is an oncoming bus in the opposite lane with its headlights on, which reminds the ego car to maintain proper lane discipline and be vigilant as the bright lights may affect the driver's vision temporarily. Additionally, there are vehicles parked along the right side of the road. The ego car must navigate carefully around these parked vehicles as they reduce the usable lane space and introduce risks such as potentially opening doors or pedestrians stepping into the road unexpectedly.\n\nMoreover, a yellow traffic cone is positioned to the right of the ego car, serving as a warning for possible road hazards or construction ahead. It suggests that the vehicle should possibly slow down and be prepared for unexpected road conditions. Also on the right, there is a yellow and black striped barrier partially blocking the road shoulder, indicating that this part of the road is off-limits and effectively reducing the available driving area for the ego car. No additional vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects have been reported in the scene."
