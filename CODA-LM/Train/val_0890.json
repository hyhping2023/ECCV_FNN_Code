However, there is a traffic sign visible; it's a blue square sign with a white car icon and an arrow that indicates a parking area to the right. This sign informs drivers, including the ego vehicle, of an available parking area on the right, which might affect the driver's decision to turn right if they intend to park there. Additionally, there are multiple orange and white traffic cones arranged in a line that tapers to the left. The traffic cones are likely indicating a hazard or ongoing road work, and they serve to guide the traffic away from the right side of the road, ensuring drivers adjust their path accordingly. There are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects depicted in the image."

Traffic cones have a bright, easily noticeable color, often orange, and are used to alert drivers to changing conditions, such as construction zones, accidents, or alterations in traffic flow. The presence of a traffic cone in this driving scenario signals that the driver of the ego car should proceed with caution, potentially preparing to stop or navigate around an obstacle, change lanes, or follow alternate routing directions provided by signs or flaggers.",
