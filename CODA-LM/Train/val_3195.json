This parked car could potentially move into the lane of the ego car or open a door, prompting the ego car to remain cautious and possibly adjust its position or speed to avoid any incidents.\n\nAdditionally, several construction workers are present on the right side of the road, near the roadworks. The proximity of the workers to the roadway could result in unexpected movements into the road, which would require the ego car to slow down and be ready to stop if necessary to ensure safety.\n\nOrange traffic cones are also positioned on the right side of the road, marking the area of the roadworks. These cones serve as a warning for the ego car to not enter the restricted area and to exercise caution when passing by the roadworks.\n\nFurthermore, there are temporary roadwork barriers on the right, which are partly occupying the lane and consequently narrowing the driving path. The presence of these barriers necessitates that the ego car adjust its lateral position within the lane to maintain a safe distance from both the workers and the barriers, ensuring a secure passage through the roadwork zone."
