This scenario unfolds under nighttime conditions. The prominence of the truck, coupled with its direct placement in front of the ego vehicle, critically influences the driving behavior of the ego car. This is primarily due to the major obstruction of visibility it causes, necessitating careful consideration by the ego car concerning maintaining a safe following distance or the feasibility of an overtaking maneuver."

Its size and the fact it's directly in front of the ego car means that visibility and potential for overtaking are limited, influencing the driver of the ego car to maintain a safe trailing distance and be cautious when considering passing the truck. This would also influence the driver to pay close attention to the truck's brake lights and indicators for any sudden stops or turns.",

Use headlights appropriately to maximize visibility without blinding other road users.
