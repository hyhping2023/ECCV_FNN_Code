        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and vehicles that the ego car must be aware of. Firstly, there is a black SUV directly in front of the ego car, occupying the center of the driving lane. This SUV's position requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance as it directly impacts the ego car's ability to move forward. Additionally, there are parked vehicles on both sides of the road. The proximity of these parked vehicles poses potential hazards, such as the risk of doors opening suddenly or a vehicle pulling out unexpectedly, which the ego car must be vigilant about. Furthermore, a motorcyclist is observed ahead on the right, riding between the parked vehicles and the driving lane. The presence of the motorcyclist means the ego car must be ready to slow down or change lanes if the motorcyclist decides to merge into the driving lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
