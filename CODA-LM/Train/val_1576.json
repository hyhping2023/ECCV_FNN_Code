The first is a red forklift situated to the left of the ego car, partially on the road, with its load protruding onto the street. The location and cargo of the forklift may create a potential hazard, as it could block the ego car's lane or result in debris spilling onto the driving path. The second element is a traffic light positioned ahead, which is currently displaying a red signal in the direction the ego car is traveling. This red light indicates that the ego car must bring itself to a full stop at the upcoming intersection. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the image that would influence the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "A construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, is visible in the scenario. This type of vehicle is typically used in construction sites for lifting and moving materials. In a driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle often indicates ongoing construction work, which may lead to road obstructions, traffic congestion, or temporary traffic signs that require drivers to reduce their speed or change lanes. The drivers must be vigilant and prepared to adapt to changing road conditions, ensuring safety for both the construction workers and themselves.",
