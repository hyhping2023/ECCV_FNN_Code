        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several elements to note that impact the driving dynamics for the autonomous vehicle (ego car). \n\nFirstly, there are parked cars located on the right side of the road. These vehicles are parked in alignment with the road and are facing away from the ego car. The presence of these parked cars reduces the available space on the road and necessitates cautious driving to avoid any potential collisions. This is especially important because there is a risk of car doors opening or pedestrians emerging from between the vehicles that could lead to accidents.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian crossing the road at a designated crosswalk right in front of the ego car. Given that pedestrians have priority in crosswalks, the autonomous vehicle must come to a complete stop to allow the pedestrian to cross the street safely, thereby respecting their right of way.\n\nAlthough the visibility in the image is limited due to it being nighttime, there are no specific traffic signs visible. Despite the lack of visible signage, the ego car is required to maintain a high level of alertness and comply with standard traffic regulations, such as yielding to pedestrians in crosswalks.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, none are discernible in the present view. In scenarios where traffic lights are not present or not visible, the autonomous vehicle is expected to navigate based on observable road signs and common traffic laws.\n\nLastly, there are garbage bins placed next to the parked cars on the right side of the road. These bins are not currently an obstruction to the vehicle's pathway. However, they could pose a potential hazard if they were to be moved unexpectedly onto the road or if they concealed pedestrians attempting to cross the road, which must be taken into account.\n\nThe summary clearly indicates that while some elements are directly affecting the road's usability, such as parked cars and the pedestrian, other elements, although not immediately obstructing the path, still require consideration due to the possibility of unexpected events, such as the garbage bins. Traffic signs and lights are not currently impacting driving behavior but are important factors in general driving awareness. Traffic cones and barriers are not observed in this image and, as such, do not require consideration in this specific scenario."

These are commonly placed alongside roadways for public use, primarily intended for waste disposal by pedestrians and residents nearby. The presence of dustbins in this location indicates a likely foot traffic area, and as such, drivers should be cautious of pedestrians who might approach the bins to dispose of waste. Additionally, the bins should be noted for not obscuring any traffic signals or signs. The driver of the ego vehicle should maintain awareness for any sudden pedestrian movements near these bins while driving.",

No maneuvers should be made until the pedestrian is safely across and the full roadway ahead is visible and free of obstructions."
