        "description and explanation": "In this traffic scenario, there are several road users and objects that the ego car must be aware of for safe navigation. Firstly, a large orange tank truck is on the right side of the ego car, occupying the right lane, and moving in the same direction. The size and presence of the tank truck means the ego car must maintain a safe distance and potentially change lanes to overtake if the truck is moving slowly.\n\nAhead of the ego car, in the center lane, is a black minivan also traveling in the same direction. The ego car should regulate its speed and following distance with respect to the minivan to ensure safe driving conditions.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, there is a pedestrian, who appears to be a maintenance worker, walking away from the roadway. Although the pedestrian is not on the road, the situation still warrants the vigilance of the ego car for any unexpected movements onto the road.\n\nSignage is also present in the scene. A No U-turn sign is on the left side of the road, clearly indicating that performing a U-turn at this junction is prohibited. The ego car is required to observe this sign to avoid illegal maneuvers which could lead to violations or collisions.\n\nFurthermore, a series of traffic cones have been positioned on the right side of the road, segregating the main roadway from an exit lane. The cones suggest that there could be a closure or restrictions on the exit lane, prompting the ego car to avoid this lane and perhaps alter its route if necessary.\n\nLastly, the presence of a street light pole is noted near the pedestrian on the right side of the ego car. While the street light pole itself does not influence driving behavior, it signifies an area where pedestrians may cross the road and thus requires attention. \n\nNo other categories such as traffic lights or barriers are present in this scenario, so their consideration in the driving behavior is not necessitated."
