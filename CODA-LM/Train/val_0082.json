        "description and explanation": "The image shows a variety of road users and objects. There are several vehicles in sight. A black SUV is on the right side of our vehicle, in the adjacent lane ahead, moving in the same direction. This SUV could influence our vehicle's lane change decisions or pacing. Further ahead in the same lane as the SUV, there's a white van that appears to be stationary or moving slowly. This van sets the pace for the lane, potentially causing our vehicle to slow down or change lanes. There are also various motorcycles and scooters in the intersection, some moving across our vehicle's path and some waiting to turn or move ahead. These road users require our vehicle to adjust its speed and trajectory to avoid them safely.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, pedestrians are seen on the right sidewalk parallel to our vehicle, but none are attempting to cross the street. Even though they aren't crossing, they should be monitored in case of unexpected entry into the roadway. Bicyclists are on the far right both on the roadway and the sidewalk, moving in a direction perpendicular to our vehicle's path. These cyclists might cross the intersection or merge with the traffic, requiring our vehicle to account for their trajectories.\n\nThere's a road sign on the right indicating a prohibition of parking or stopping. This sign doesn't directly affect the current movement of our vehicle but should be obeyed in terms of parking behavior. The traffic light for our lane is green, allowing our vehicle to proceed. This green signal indicates that our vehicle can maintain its course through the intersection, observing caution with the cross-traffic.\n\nA single traffic cone is visible on the right edge of the image, nearer to our vehicle within the intersection area. This traffic cone could indicate a hazard or construction nearby; our vehicle should steer clear of it. Lastly, a large spooled object lies to the left of our vehicle, not on the road but on the sidewalk or side area. While it does not directly impede the vehicle's path, it should be noted in case it enters the roadway."

Keep a watchful eye on possible pedestrian movement, and be prepared for cyclists who may enter the lane of travel. Despite having the right of way with a green light, remain vigilant for all cross-sectional movements and maintain a safe passing distance from the traffic cone. Avoid any distractions from objects off the roadway but be aware of potential road hazards."
