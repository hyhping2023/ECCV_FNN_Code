A white SUV ahead in the same lane has its rear lights illuminated, signaling that it is either slowing down or stopped, implying that the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop accordingly. Additionally, several vehicles can be seen moving in the opposite lane with their headlights on, which could cause glare and reduce visibility for the ego vehicle, particularly in dark and wet-road conditions.\n\nA traffic sign is visible on the right-hand side of the road. The sign is red and white striped, indicating a lane closure or merging ahead. This alerts the driver to potential changes in lane usage and suggests a need to merge left if the current lane is ending.\n\nReflective traffic cones are lined up on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, indicating that a section of the lane is cordoned off, likely for construction or an accident. These cones dictate the drivable pathway and instruct the ego car to maintain a safe distance, potentially requiring a lane change or reduced speed."
