These vehicles have a direct impact on the driving strategy of the autonomous ego car, necessitating adjustments in speed and following distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible on the right-hand side; however, its color is indistinguishable due to the overexposure caused by headlight glare. This presents a critical situation for the ego car, as determining the color of the traffic light is essential to decide whether to stop, get ready to stop, or to proceed through the intersection.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or miscellaneous objects are depicted in the image, indicating that these categories do not influence the autonomous driving decisions in this scenario."
