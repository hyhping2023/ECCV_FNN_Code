This vehicle is performing work on the road, which may necessitate a reduction in speed or a lane change by the ego car for safety and continued progress. Additionally, a green bus is operating in the left lane and may periodically stop to board or alight passengers, potentially disrupting the traffic flow and thus requiring the ego car to be vigilant and possibly adjust speed or change lanes accordingly.\n\nOn the periphery of the ego car, a cyclist is riding in the same direction to the right, wearing protective gear, which implies that the ego vehicle will need to carefully choose speed and lane positioning when overtaking. There is also a pedestrian, recognizable by a hi-visibility jacket, standing on the median strip next to the utility vehicle; this person's presence suggests extra caution is needed in case they enter the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is situated to the right-hand side of the road, notifying the ego car that it should be prepared to stop or yield to pedestrians that might be crossing further down the road.\n\nIn the ego car's lane, orange traffic cones are set up on the left, signaling a work zone that may alter the driving path or lane width, requiring the ego car to safely maneuver around this obstruction. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that could affect the driving conditions."

Additionally, the presence of a pedestrian crossing sign requires readiness to yield to pedestrians that may be crossing."
