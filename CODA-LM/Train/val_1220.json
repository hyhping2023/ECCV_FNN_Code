        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles that are particularly noteworthy. Firstly, a white sedan is parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. This parked car is significant because it occupies part of the right lane, potentially requiring the ego car to merge or maneuver to the left to maintain a safe distance while passing by. Secondly, there is a truck loaded with soil directly in front of the ego car, sharing the same lane. The presence of this truck is critical as it could obstruct the view ahead for the ego car and might slow down or stop without warning, which means the ego car must follow at a safe distance and be prepared to react to the truck's movements. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that affect driving behavior."
