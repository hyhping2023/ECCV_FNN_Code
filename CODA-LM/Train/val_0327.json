        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, multiple road users and traffic control devices are interacting and affecting the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle (ego car).\n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a black SUV positioned directly in front of the ego car, stationed in the middle of its lane at a crosswalk. This vehicle requires that the ego car maintain a safe following distance as it dictates the immediate movements. Alongside, there are multiple other vehicles in the adjacent lanes to the left; some are moving. These vehicles could potentially shift lanes or exhibit unpredictable behaviors, necessitating continuous surveillance by the ego car. Additionally, a white sedan is observed on the right, moving parallel to the crosswalk. This indicates that the traffic in this particular area is flowing and that the ego car should be ready to move when it is safe.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, a pedestrian in a bright orange suit is noted standing on the crosswalk to the right, suggesting a likelihood of crossing activity. The ego car must be prepared to yield or stop based on the pedestrian's movements, in accordance with traffic laws.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a no parking sign visible above the road on the right, accompanying directional indication signs. These are crucial for informing long-term route planning and immediate parking restrictions, although they don't influence instant driving actions.\n\nA traffic light at the center-top of the image indicates a green signal allowing vehicles to proceed straight while displaying a red signal for those intending to turn left, thereby restricting left turns at this junction.\n\nLastly, orange traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the crosswalk, indicating a section to be avoided, possibly due to roadwork or similar activities. The presence of these cones guides the ego car to maintain its current lane and not to drift to the right.\n\nThis comprehensive overview of traffic components ensures that the autonomous driving system can make informed, safe driving decisions in real-time."
