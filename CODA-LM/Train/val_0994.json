This sign indicates that the ego car, or any other vehicle, should not stop or park at this location.\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of other objects in the scene. A green-colored utility box is on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car; it is stationary and placed away from the road, posing no immediate concern but should be noted in the driving scene context. Another object is a yellow and orange trashcan on the sidewalk on the right side of the road, which also remains stationary and does not affect the ego car's driving behavior unless its contents were to spill onto the road."
