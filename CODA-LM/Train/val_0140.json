The presence of this vehicle is critical as it could either start moving or remain stationary based on the traffic signal, which would influence the ego car's decision to either proceed or stop. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in the adjacent lanes and in the opposite direction on the road. Some of these vehicles are in motion while others are stopped due to the traffic signal. The potential for these vehicles to change lanes or cross the intersection could affect the ego vehicle's movement decisions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, cyclists and motorcyclists are moving parallel to the traffic. Their close proximity to the traffic lane and the possibility of making unpredictable movements necessitate that the ego car monitors them and possibly adjusts its speed or lane position accordingly.\n\nA traffic sign indicating to keep right is located on the traffic island to the left. This sign is important as it directs the ego car to stay in the appropriate lane, ensuring it passes on the right side of the traffic feature.\n\nThe traffic light for the direction the ego vehicle is heading is green, which is visible straight ahead. This green light indicates that the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed through the intersection, provided it is safe to do so.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones on the right side of the road, signaling that a section of the lane might be closed or that caution is advised while passing. The ego vehicle may need to keep to the left and be cautious of any potential hazards or changes in lane availability due to these cones.\n\nLastly, a dustbin is located far to the right side of the road. While it is not influencing traffic, it is still something to be aware of as a fixed object off the roadway. Being cognizant of such fixed objects is beneficial even though they are not direct obstacles."
