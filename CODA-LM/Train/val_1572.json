The truck has various equipment loaded on its back. This poses a potential hazard as it could obstruct the view ahead for the ego car, and there is a possibility of the truck moving into the center lane. As a result, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be ready to slow down or change lanes if necessary. \n\nAdditionally, a roadwork sign is visible to the side of the road in the left foreground, alerting drivers, including the ego car, to upcoming possible hazards or changing road conditions that might impact the traffic flow due to roadwork activities.\n\nFinally, concrete median barriers are present on both sides of the highway. These barriers limit the options for lane changes or pulling over, necessitating careful lane positioning and heightened awareness of the surrounding traffic for the ego car and other road users."
