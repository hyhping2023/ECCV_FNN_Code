This vehicle appears to be moving, which could impact lane changes or turns the ego car might need to make. Additionally, a white car is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego car. The position of this parked car necessitates caution as it narrows the drivable space and may obscure hazards like opening doors or pedestrians.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, a dog is crossing the road from right to left, slightly ahead of the ego car. Due to the unpredictable nature of animals, the dog's presence may require the ego car to slow down or stop suddenly to avoid a collision.\n\nFor traffic signs, there do not appear to be any visible signs within direct sight of the ego car that would impact decisions. This lack of visible traffic signs suggests no immediate change to normal driving behavior, although ongoing observation is necessary.\n\nNo traffic lights are visible in the scene, implying that traffic control would rely on other means such as non-visible road signs or standard right of way rules.\n\nOther objects include dustbins present at the right-side corner near the parked white car. While the dustbins themselves do not pose an immediate threat, they could hide potential obstacles behind them, requiring extra vigilance."
