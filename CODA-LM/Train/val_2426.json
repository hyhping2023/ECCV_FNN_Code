Specifically, there are large spools of cable visible on the side of the road, positioned on spool holders. These spools do not encroach onto the road and, therefore, do not represent an immediate hazard to the ego vehicle as long as they remain in their current position off the roadway. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a large metallic cable reel with a decorative or functional wheel pattern at its core. The intricate design suggests it might be used either as part of a cable management system or potentially for aesthetic purposes in this setting. For the ego car's driving behavior, although the reel sits well outside the immediate roadway and should not directly influence the driving path, awareness of such roadside objects is essential because they indicate a zone where maintenance or construction materials are stored. This could lead to potential hazards if not properly safeguarded or in cases where objects might unexpectedly enter the roadway.",

Typically used in the storage and distribution of fiber optics or industrial cables, these large spools ensure the cable remains organized and protected from damage during transportation. For the ego vehicle, the presence of such industrial equipment near the roadside does not immediately affect driving behavior unless it becomes an unforeseen hazard, such as if it were to roll onto the road. The driver should be aware of potential road hazards when industrial objects are close to the driving path.",
