The truck appears to be either stationary or moving very slowly, thus obstructing the line of sight. As a result, this truck is having a significant impact on the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Actions the vehicle may be required to take include slowing down, coming to a stop, or preparing to overtake the truck if it doesn't start moving at a normal speed or remains stopped. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving environment in the current image."

Such vehicles require significant stopping distance and have limited maneuverability. When driving behind this truck, the ego car should maintain an increased following distance to ensure safety due to the vehicle's slower responsiveness to traffic changes and the possibility of sudden stops or turns by the truck.",

Due to it being nighttime and potential visibility constraints, caution is advised, including lower speeds and increased awareness."
