It could potentially move and should therefore be monitored. Additionally, large industrial cable spools are stored on the right side of the scene near the parked van. The location of these spools presents a risk as they might roll onto the road, becoming an obstruction. Lastly, the general roadside industrial environment includes possible debris, signaling the need for heightened caution. This suggests there could be other unexpected road conditions or obstacles not immediately apparent."

These objects are stationary and positioned in an outdoor storage area beside a building. For the ego car, its critical to acknowledge these objects do not pose a direct threat to the vehicle's path as the reels are well away from the drivable roadway. This information helps the driver to maintain focus on the road and supports safe driving behavior by not needing to alter course due to these stationary items.",
