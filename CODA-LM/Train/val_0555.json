A blue bus is directly in front of the ego car, within the same lane, and its brake lights are on. This suggests that the bus may be decelerating or coming to a complete stop, which means the ego car should be ready to reduce speed or stop as necessary to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white hatchback car parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. While this vehicle is currently stationary and not directly impacting the flow of traffic, it poses a potential risk if it were to suddenly join the traffic flow without proper signaling or checking for oncoming vehicles.\n\nFurthermore, there is a 'No Entry' sign on the right side of the road. This sign is critical for the ego car to observe as it indicates that the road ahead is not accessible for entry, and the ego car must avoid making any turns that would lead into the restricted area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
