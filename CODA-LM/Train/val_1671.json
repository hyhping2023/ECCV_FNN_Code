        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a few notable road users and objects. Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego car. It is positioned parallel to the road and is currently stationary. Although it does not pose an immediate threat, it is important to be aware of it in case the vehicle suddenly opens its doors or attempts to merge into traffic.\n\nAhead of the ego car, in the same lane, there is a silver sedan driving in the same direction. This vehicle has a direct impact on the driving behavior of the ego car, particularly in terms of speed and following distance. The ego car must closely monitor this sedan for any abrupt stops or changes in direction.\n\nOn the far right, a cyclist is riding in the same direction as the ego car, close to the edge of the roadway. The ego car needs to provide adequate clearance to the cyclist for safety reasons, as cyclists can be more vulnerable and their movements less predictable than those of motorized vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green railing on the right side of the road, acting as a barrier between the road and pedestrian areas or private property. This barrier influences the traffic flow and restricts the ego car's ability to move to the right. It is essential for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the barrier to prevent any contact.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a truck loaded with multiple large, unevenly shaped objects that appear as debris or construction materials. Due to its load and type, this vehicle is likely moving slower than regular traffic and may make sudden stops or reduce its speed to navigate through construction zones safely. For the ego car, it implies a need for increased attention and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes to maintain a safe distance from this slower-moving and potentially unpredictable vehicle. Consequently, the ego car must monitor this construction vehicles movements closely and be prepared for potential hazards such as falling debris or abrupt stops.",

Pass the cyclist with proper clearance, ensuring not to endanger them by moving too close. Continuously observe the parked white sedan for any activity, such as doors opening or the car engaging in traffic, and prepare to react if necessary. The green railing on the side of the road should remind the ego car not to drift right and to be cautious of potential pedestrians that could be obscured behind it."
