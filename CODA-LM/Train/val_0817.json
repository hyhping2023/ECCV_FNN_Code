This vehicle dictates the ego car's immediate speed and following distance to maintain safe driving practices. Ahead on the right, there are road workers within the boundaries of the construction zone, wearing high-visibility clothing. Their proximity to the carriageway may influence traffic flow and require the ego car to reduce speed and be prepared to stop or maneuver safely. There are also warning signs on the right, indicating construction work ahead, which inform drivers to slow down and be cautious of potential hazards due to the construction site. Additionally, orange traffic cones are positioned on the right, creating a temporary barrier around the road works. These cones signal a lane closure or road works and may require the ego car to adjust its lateral position to maintain a safe distance from the work zone. Temporary fencing is present on both sides of the road related to the construction area, which may narrow the drivable space and require cautious maneuvering. There are no traffic lights in view in the immediate vicinity of the ego car, hence they do not influence its immediate driving behavior. Lastly, there are no additional objects posing an immediate impact to the ego car's driving decisions, so no action is required regarding other objects."
