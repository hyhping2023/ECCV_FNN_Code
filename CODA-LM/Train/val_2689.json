A blue circular sign on the right side of the road, indicating that drivers must follow the road to the right. This sign directs the ego vehicle to turn right, influencing its path.\n2. A red and white circular sign perpendicular to the ego vehicle's approach, signaling 'do not enter' or prohibiting entry. This sign instructs the ego vehicle not to proceed straight ahead or turn into the road where the sign is located, due to restricted access.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple orange and white traffic cones positioned in the center of the road, forming a pathway that diverges to the right. These cones indicate a road hazard or construction area, requiring the ego vehicle to follow the designated path and move to the right.\n\nMoreover, temporary white and red striped barriers are located on the right side of the road, working in conjunction with the traffic cones to indicate a change in the accessible roadway. These barriers guide traffic and protect any unauthorized work zones, ensuring that the ego vehicle does not enter the restricted area."
