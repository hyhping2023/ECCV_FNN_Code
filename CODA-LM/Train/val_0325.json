Even though it is not currently blocking the path of the ego car, extra caution should be exercised while driving past it due to the possibility of it moving unexpectedly.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a 'No Left Turn' traffic sign mounted on a temporary barrier that denotes a construction zone. This sign is crucial as it informs the ego car's driver that left turns are not allowed, requiring the vehicle to continue straight or to turn right if possible.\n\nFurthermore, temporary construction barriers are positioned ahead and on the right, limiting the accessible road and indicating that there is a construction site nearby. The presence of these barriers means that the ego car will need to adjust its route to avoid the construction area, which could also lead to a change in the usual traffic flow and potentially reduce the width of the drivable road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects identified in the image that warrant attention."
