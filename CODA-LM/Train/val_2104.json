        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a construction vehicle, specifically a steamroller, located in the left lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this construction vehicle necessitates caution on the part of the ego car, which may need to change lanes to maintain the flow of traffic and avoid any unpredictable actions from the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, two pedestrians are observed standing behind protective roadside barriers on the right sidewalk. While they are not directly in the path of vehicles, their proximity to the road means that the ego car should remain vigilant as they could unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a round sign on the right indicating a speed limit of 20 km/h is approaching, with an additional board that may provide further details about the speed limit's application or enforcement. This sign signals that the ego car should be ready to decelerate to adhere to the new speed limit. Furthermore, a blue circular sign with a white arrow pointing right is present, which mandates that traffic must follow the right lanes or turn right, possibly in anticipation of upcoming changes in lane configurations.\n\nProtective barriers are installed along the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the roadway and the pedestrian zone. These barriers enhance pedestrian safety but also restrict the available space for vehicular maneuvers in case of an emergency. The ego car must remain within the marked lanes and be conscious that these barriers may obscure potential hazards.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

Caution should also be exercised due to the presence of pedestrians near the roadside, although no immediate action is required since they are behind barriers. Lastly, the ego car should monitor for any signs indicating a need to change lanes or directions due to the mandatory right turn sign ahead."
