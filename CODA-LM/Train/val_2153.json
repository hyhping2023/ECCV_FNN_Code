The first is a motorcycle situated in the middle of the road, advancing forward. The motorcycle's position directly in the trajectory of our vehicle (referred to as the \"ego car\") necessitates an adjustment in speed and following distance since motorcycles can exhibit less predictable movements than cars and must therefore be attentively observed.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars positioned on the left-hand side of the road, also moving forward. While these vehicles occupy the adjacent lanes and don’t pose an immediate danger to the ego car, they nonetheless require surveillance as they might abruptly change lanes, potentially impacting driving decisions.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this traffic image, indicating that they don’t have relevance to the current driving scenario."
