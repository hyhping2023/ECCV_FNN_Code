The vehicle's red tail lights are illuminated, which signifies that it's either slowing down or moving ahead of the ego car. This necessitates that the ego car maintains a secure following distance, ensuring it's prepared to either adjust its speed or come to a stop if required.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is present within the scene. However, the image's overexposure has led to the traffic light's signal color being indiscernible, making it impossible to ascertain its current state. Given this ambiguity, it's imperative that the ego car approaches the intersection with heightened caution, remaining ready to halt should the light be red.\n\nMoreover, the scene is affected by a glare originating from streetlights and a reflective surface located on the right-hand side. This glare could potentially hinder the ego car's sensors from accurately detecting and evaluating the surroundings. Therefore, it's advised that extra caution is exercised to mitigate the risk of compromised visibility."
