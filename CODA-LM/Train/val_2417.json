Although it is not moving, it is partially occupying the parking area or roadside, which means the ego car should maintain a safe distance when passing by to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nOn the right side, a black sedan is stopped next to a fence, oriented parallel to the ego car's direction of travel. The ego car should keep an eye on this vehicle for any indications that it might start moving, such as the illumination of brake lights or activation of turn signals, which would suggest the driver's intention to merge into traffic.\n\nAdditionally, a continuous metal fence is present along the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the construction site and the roadway. This barrier ensures that there will be no unexpected cross traffic from the right and it also guides the ego car to stay in its current lane while being alert for any obstructions that might arise from the construction area.\n\nLastly, there is a forklift positioned on the right side of the image, with a portion of it extending into the roadway. The presence of the forklift is a potential hazard, as it could suddenly move onto the road or indicate that workers may be nearby, which requires the ego car to proceed with caution in this area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones reported in the image."

Forklifts are typically used on construction sites to transport and lift heavy materials. The presence of this vehicle suggests active construction work nearby. In a driving scenario, the ego car must be cautious, maintaining a safe distance and speed, as the operation of such vehicles can lead to sudden movements or obstructions in the path. Furthermore, the area might be prone to additional traffic regulations like reduced speed limits, warning signs, or alternative routes to facilitate safe coexistence of road and construction traffic.",
