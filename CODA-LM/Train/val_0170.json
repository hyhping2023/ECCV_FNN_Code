Although it is present, this car does not influence the ego car's immediate driving decisions as it is on the opposite side and the intersection seems to be controlled by traffic lights.\n\nThere are two cyclists captured in the scene. One of them is in the crossing's center on the left side, heading across the path of the ego car, while the other has already traversed the street and is distancing from the intersection. The ego car must take caution with the cyclist in the crossing to allow safe passage.\n\nDirectional signs indicating a road split ahead are visible but do not influence the immediate actions of the ego car at the current intersection. However, they are important for overall route planning.\n\nThe traffic light facing the ego car's lane is red, which indicates a requirement for the ego car to stop and remain stationary until the light changes.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a series of red and white traffic cones delineating an area to be avoided, potentially due to road work or other hazards. The ego car should keep within its lane and approach the area with caution for any upcoming obstructions or activities.\n\nLastly, a dustbin and some parked bicycles can be seen to the right side of the image, but since they are not on the roadway, they do not affect the immediate driving decisions of the ego car."
