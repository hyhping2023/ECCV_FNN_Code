On the left side of the road, there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. While they do not pose an immediate threat, they should be monitored for any sudden movement onto the road. On the right side, a person is sitting on a parked motorcycle. This person does not pose an immediate threat but could potentially move into the driving lane, requiring caution.

This vehicle is directly in front of the ego car.
