This requires the ego car to also reduce speed or prepare to stop to maintain a safe distance. Overhead, there are directional signs that provide lane and direction information for upcoming roads, which the ego car needs to observe to stay in the correct lane for its intended route. The traffic lights in the scene are red, signaling that all traffic must come to a complete stop. Alongside the road, there are yellow and red traffic cones indicating a construction or roadwork area, prompting the ego car to proceed with caution and be ready for potential obstacles or changes in traffic flow. Large orange barriers are also present next to the traffic cones, emphasizing the construction zone and signaling the ego car to keep to its lane and avoid lane changes near the construction. Additionally, there is a large construction excavator on the right side of the road, with part of it extending into the street. This indicates that the ego car should exercise extreme caution, be vigilant for construction workers, and be prepared for any sudden movements of construction machinery."
