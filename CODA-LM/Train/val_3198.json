Directly ahead of the ego car is a large green construction vehicle occupying the entire lane, bearing the license plate EF6996. This construction vehicle poses an immediate obstacle which the ego car must navigate around to continue on its route.\n2. To the left and slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a white van decorated with red and white reflecting stripes. The presence of this van may affect the traffic flow and potentially require the ego car to adjust its decision-making should the van change lanes.\n3. On the ego car's right side, within the neighboring lane and slightly behind the line of travel, a black sedan is observed. The sedan's close proximity to the ego car's lane requires careful monitoring for any sudden lane changes or unexpected maneuvers.\n\nTraffic Signs:\nThere is a no-left-turn sign located on the same pole as the traffic light, situated above the pedestrian crossing button. This sign directly affects the ego car's route by prohibiting left turns at the intersection.\n\nTraffic Lights:\nThe traffic lights control both the left turn lane and the straight direction. Currently, the lights for going straight are red, indicating that the ego car must stop at the intersection and wait for the green signal to proceed.\n\nBarriers:\nMetal barriers with red and white reflective signs are installed along the central reservation of the road. These barriers signal ongoing roadwork or a no-entry zone, thus the ego car should be aware of these to avoid any driving infractions.\n\nThe image does not depict any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects."

Monitor the white van and black sedan for any sudden movements that could affect your path and proceed with caution once the light turns green."
