This vehicle indicates there might be lane closures or detours ahead due to ongoing road work or maintenance. The display of the arrow board will influence driving behavior, necessitating potential lane changes or adherence to detours. Secondly, a white utility truck or pickup truck is stopped on the road's shoulder. The truck's position suggests it may have broken down or is being used for maintenance tasks. As the vehicle is not moving, other road users must pass by cautiously, especially if the shoulder area is not wide, to ensure safety and unimpeded traffic flow."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a large yellow truck equipped with machinery possibly for lifting or moving heavy materials. This type of vehicle is typically seen at or near construction sites and may be involved in road works or other heavy duty tasks concerning construction. Its presence on the road can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution, slower speeds, and possibly changes in lane usage to maintain safety distances and accommodate the construction vehicle's operational space. Drivers may also need to be alert for additional signage or directions related to the ongoing construction activities.",
