These signs inform the ego car that honking and stopping are prohibited on this part of the road. Additionally, there are pedestrian crossing signs indicating a designated area ahead on the right where pedestrians may cross the road, and the ego car should be ready to yield to them.\n\nThe traffic lights at the intersection ahead are red, requiring the ego car to come to a complete stop and not enter the intersection. On the right side of the rightmost lane, before the crosswalk, there is a row of orange traffic cones leading into a construction zone. These cones suggest that there may be road work or obstructions ahead, and the ego car might need to change lanes to the left if the rightmost lane is closed. Furthermore, yellow and black striped barriers are placed on both sides of the road near the intersection, indicating that certain areas are off-limits, likely due to construction or road maintenance activities. There are no other objects or traffic cones mentioned in the image."
