These signs are characterized by orange and white stripes along with Chinese characters and arrows that direct traffic to merge left, thus, signaling drivers to be prepared for changes in the usual traffic patterns due to the ongoing roadwork. \n\nAdditionally, a traffic light is observed straight ahead, which is currently displaying a green light, implying that traffic is allowed to proceed. This green light suggests that while the ego car (the car from whose perspective the image is taken) is free to move through the intersection, it should remain alert to the changes in the traffic flow, primarily due to the roadwork indicated by the traffic signs.\n\nFurthermore, metal barriers adorned with reflective red and white stripes are positioned at the center of the road, directly on the ego car's intended path. These barriers are installed to redirect the traffic flow around the roadwork area, necessitating that the ego car must alter its course to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nNo traffic cones or other miscellaneous objects are observed in this scenario, which restricts the summary to the above details regarding the traffic situation visible in the image."
