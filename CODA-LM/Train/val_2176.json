There's a large, orange truck carrying equipment directly in front of the ego car, in the right lane and moving in the same direction. The truck limits the forward visibility for the ego car and requires that a safe following distance be maintained due to its size and potential for sudden stops or reduced speeds.\n2. To the left of the ego car is a black car in the left lane, also moving in the same direction. The ego car must be aware of the black car's relative position and speed and watch for any signals that might indicate it intends to change lanes, as this could affect the ego car's ability to safely maneuver.\n\nTraffic Signs:\nAn overhead gantry sign structure is present above the road; however, it is currently blank and does not display any visible signs or information. Drivers should stay alert for any future changes that could provide critical traffic information or directions.\n\nBarriers:\nA green fence is running alongside the road on the right, indicating restricted access to areas beyond the road. This could be due to construction or maintenance and may cause traffic flow adjustments or restrictions.\n\nTraffic lights as well as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, and other objects are not present or visible in the image. Drivers must rely on general road rules and be watchful for any upcoming signals or signs due to the absence of visible traffic lights."
