The presence of this bus necessitates maintaining a safe following distance as it may affect the traffic flow by changes in its speed or lane positioning. Additionally, there are green directional signs posted along the road indicating route numbers and directions, providing helpful information for potential upcoming exits or route changes that the ego car may need to consider for lane changes or turns. On the side of the road, multiple orange traffic cones suggest a work zone or construction area is present, signaling that there may be a lane closure or a narrowing road ahead, which would require the driver to exercise extra caution and potentially reduce speed. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in this image."
