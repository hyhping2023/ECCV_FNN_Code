This parked car reduces the usable width of the carriageway, necessitating that the ego car adjust its lateral position when passing to ensure adequate clearance.\n\nMoreover, the scene includes orange traffic cones and barriers on the right side of the road, which imply there might be construction or some area that has been closed off. As a result, the ego car should reduce its speed and proceed with caution, staying ready to respond to any potential changes in the road conditions that these objects might signify.\n\nAdditionally, white metal barriers can be observed positioned along the edge of the sidewalk. These barriers serve to separate the pedestrian walkway from the road, safeguarding pedestrians by preventing them from accidentally stepping into traffic. They also provide a clear visual cue for the ego car to discern the boundaries of its drivable lane.\n\nLastly, there are other objects at the scene, including some debris and fallen traffic barriers on the right side, which possibly indicate prior incidents or ongoing work. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from the edge of the road because of these hazards and be prepared for maneuvers such as stopping or swerving to evade any unforeseen obstructions.\n\nThere is no mention of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights in the current traffic conditions based on the provided JSON data."
