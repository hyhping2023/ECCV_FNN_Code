These vehicles are not directly in the path of the ego car but suggest that the area is populated, necessitating additional caution while navigating through. Additionally, the lighting condition in the image is low, with the likely source of illumination being the headlights from the ego car. This indicates poor visibility conditions, requiring the driver to reduce speed and maintain heightened awareness for potential unexpected obstacles on the road. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not have any entries in this scenario, indicating their absence in the traffic image."
