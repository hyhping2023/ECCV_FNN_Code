It is characterized by its large rotating drum on the back, which is typical of cement mixers. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, it is essential to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle. Construction vehicles like this one can often start and stop unpredictably, especially if active in a construction zone. Additionally, these types of vehicles might make sudden turns into work sites or have debris around them that could affect roadway safety.",
