        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are a couple of notable elements regarding the vehicles present. Firstly, there is a silver sedan located in the lane to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead. The presence of this sedan is particularly significant for the autonomous system of the ego car; it must closely monitor the sedan's behavior, as it could influence the ego car's decisions related to lane changes or speed adjustments. Additionally, there are several vehicles parked on the right side of the road, including a bus, vans, and cars. The proximity of these parked vehicles means that the ego car needs to adhere strictly to its current lane to avoid any potential collisions. Furthermore, there is an element of caution required for the possibility of pedestrians stepping out from between these parked vehicles, which could create sudden obstacles in the path of the ego car."
