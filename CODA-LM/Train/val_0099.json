Beginning with vehicles, there is a white sedan on the left lane traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, which requires monitoring to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, several cars are visible in the distance, occupying the right lane and also moving in the same direction, influencing potential lane changes and speed adjustments for the autonomous car.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there are overhead directional signs present, providing important information about exits and how to manage the lanes for navigation. A 'road narrows' sign is also spotted on the right, signaling that the right lane is coming to an end, which might necessitate a merge to the left, requiring the autonomous vehicle to be mindful of the traffic merging from the right.\n\nThe traffic cones in view consist of a series of orange and white ones on the right-hand side of the road, directing traffic away from the rightmost lane, indicating a lane closure that could entail merging to the left.\n\nFinally, a concrete barrier is located on the right side of the road, demarcating the boundary of the driving space available and indicating the start of a work zone. This requires heightened lane discipline to navigate the area safely.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects that might affect driving behavior."
