The presence of the SUV is significant as it could change lanes or slow down, which would affect the ego car's movement. Additionally, there are several cars parked on the right side of the road. These parked cars could obstruct the view for the ego car, and there is a risk that one might pull out suddenly, necessitating caution.\n\nOn the road, there is also a motorcyclist in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. The motorcyclist's behavior is unpredictable as they could potentially change lanes or stop abruptly, posing a potential hazard to the ego car.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image show a green light ahead for the ego car's direction, indicating that it is safe for the ego car to proceed.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones partitioning a section of the road on the right. These cones suggest there might be roadwork or a closed-off area, which results in a narrower drivable road space for the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Be cautious of the parked cars on the right, watching for any activity that may indicate a vehicle is about to enter the road. Keep an eye on the motorcyclist, as motorcycles can be less stable and more unpredictable than cars. With the green traffic light, the ego car can continue to move forward but should remain alert to the traffic conditions and road partitioning by the cones. Adjust speed if necessary to maintain safe travel through the narrowed space."
