        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a black dog crossing the street which is not a vehicle, but it presents a potential hazard that could require the ego car to stop or swerve to prevent an accident. Pedestrians are observed behind a metal fence on the right side of the road; while they are not on the road, their close proximity suggests the possibility of them entering the road unexpectedly, and the ego car must therefore remain cautious. A directional sign featuring Chinese characters is present on the right, which could provide the ego car with important navigational information about upcoming turns or merges. There are no traffic lights visible in this image. The metal fence along the right side serves as a barrier indicating that pedestrians should stay on the sidewalk, thereby suggesting that the road should be clear for the ego car to proceed. Lastly, there are parked cars on both sides of the street which constrict the drivable path and impair visibility, thus the ego car is advised to proceed with reduced speed and heightened alertness. Traffic cones were not mentioned in the provided data, indicating there are none in the image."
