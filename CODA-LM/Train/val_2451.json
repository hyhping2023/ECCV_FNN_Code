The first is a large military truck that is taking up most of the right lane and is moving in the same direction as the ego car. The military truck's significant size and likely slower speed necessitate careful consideration for overtaking maneuvers. Given the truck's right lane position, the ego car needs to check that it is safe to pass on the left.\n\nAdditionally, there is a three-wheeled motorized vehicle ahead, also on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Due to its smaller size and potentially lower speed, the ego car should approach and overtake this vehicle with caution to maintain safety.\n\nNo other road users or traffic-related objects, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in this traffic image."

Additionally, the ego car should moderate its speed to account for the wet or damp road surface to ensure safe stopping distances."
