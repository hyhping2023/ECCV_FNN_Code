On the right side, two red traffic lights are visible, indicating a stop signal in the direction they are facing. This suggests that the ego car will soon encounter a signal-controlled intersection or pedestrian crossing, necessitating a stop or yielding.\n\nAhead, a series of orange traffic cones are positioned diagonally to the left, signaling potential lane closures or roadworks. This implies a change in the traffic pattern that may require the ego car to shift to a different lane or road segment.\n\nAdditionally, blue barriers with reflective stripes are set up on the right-hand side, blocking off a portion of the road. These barriers indicate an area that vehicles must avoid, likely due to construction, an event, or an incident.\n\nNo vehicles, vulnerable road users, other traffic signs, or miscellaneous objects were observed in the traffic image."

Traffic cones are typically bright orange with a reflective strip to increase visibility during night or poor weather conditions. Placed on roads to signal ongoing maintenance, hazards, or altering driving lanes, they guide vehicles to maneuver safely and avoid specific areas.
