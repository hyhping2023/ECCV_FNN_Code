Firstly, there is a white car ahead in the same lane, positioned centrally on the road and traveling in the same direction as the ego car. This vehicle's proximity and movement could impact the speed and following distance of the ego car. Additionally, a motorcycle is parked on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the ego car. Although it is stationary, its position close to the traffic lane necessitates maintaining a lateral distance for safety.\n\nAmong vulnerable road users, there is a motorcyclist in a blue jacket riding in the opposite lane and approaching the ego car. This oncoming traffic scenario requires the ego car to stay in its lane and remain vigilant for any potential road hazards from the opposite lane.\n\nFurthermore, a cluster of other objects, including bicycles and another motorcycle, is parked at the roadside on the right, ahead of the ego car. The objects' presence near the traffic lane could pose a hazard if any unexpected movement occurs in that area."
