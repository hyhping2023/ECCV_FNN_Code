The truck seems to be either moving at a reduced speed or has come to a stop as it is centered in the lane. The location and movement of the truck necessitate an adjustment from the ego car, which may need to decrease its speed or change lanes when safe to maintain an appropriate distance and be ready for any stops or turns that the truck might make.\n\nAdditionally, there is an orange and white traffic cone placed on the right edge of the ego car's lane. The placement of this cone serves as a warning for potential road work or unexpected hazards lying ahead. As a precaution, the ego car should remain vigilant and may need to modify its trajectory slightly to the left to avoid the cone while safely proceeding onwards."
