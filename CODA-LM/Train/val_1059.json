The presence of the bus necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe following distance and be ready to decelerate or stop in response to the bus's actions. To the right side of the bus and slightly ahead, there is a motorcyclist moving in the same direction as the traffic. The proximity and unpredictability of the motorcycle require the ego car to exercise caution and remain vigilant when attempting to overtake or change lanes.\n\nMoreover, a line of orange traffic cones can be seen demarcating the driving lane from either an on-street parking area or a bike lane on the right. These cones serve as a barrier that the ego car must not cross, ensuring that the vehicle stays within the correct lane of travel. Alongside the sidewalk on the right, metal barriers are present, running parallel to the parked bicycles and scooters. The purpose of these barriers is to safeguard pedestrians and indicate that the drivable portion of the road is confined to the area to the left of the cones.\n\nAdditionally, parked bicycles and motorbikes are located beyond the metal barriers on the right side of the street. Although not an immediate obstacle for the ego car, the mix of different road users highlighted by their presence demands constant attentiveness to ensure safe navigation through the area. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other notable objects affecting the ego car's driving behavior in this particular image."
