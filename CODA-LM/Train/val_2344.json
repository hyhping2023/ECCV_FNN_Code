        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, we have several road users and relevant details:\n\nThere is a yellow construction vehicle positioned directly in front of the ego car. It can be identified by the crane arm on the back and Japanese script on the side. Close attention to this vehicle is required as it may affect the ego car's maneuverability or unexpectedly change speed or direction.\n\nA white van is present to the left side of the image, occupying the lane adjacent to the ego car's left. The possibility of the van merging into the ego car's lane necessitates vigilance to potentially adjust speed or position accordingly.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is a grey sedan in the lane beside the ego car's right. The ego car must stay alert to the sedan's movement as it could potentially change lanes, which would necessitate an immediate reactionary measure from the ego car to ensure safety and avoid collision.\n\nWithin the left lane, ahead and partially hidden by the van, a bus is visible. The presence of the bus suggests an increased probability of stopping or slowing down, especially if it's nearing a bus stop. Thus, it's crucial for the ego car to maintain an adequate following distance.\n\nSeveral other vehicles are seen in adjacent lanes ahead, with a white truck noticeable over the van's top. These vehicles are part of the overall traffic flow and might influence the ego car's ability to switch lanes or modify speed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects visible in the image. Moreover, no traffic lights can be seen, so the ego car must depend on traffic signs and the behavior of other road users to determine its course of action."
