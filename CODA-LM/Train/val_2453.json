This necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe distance behind the white car, ensuring it can adapt its speed as needed to follow safely. On the right side, there is a warning road sign indicating an upcoming junction, informing the ego car to be vigilant for vehicles that might merge into the lane and to be prepared to yield if necessary. Additionally, there's a sign indicating the presence of traffic lights ahead, prompting the ego car to anticipate stopping or moving depending on the signal's status. Ahead, there is a set of traffic lights currently displaying red. The ego car is required to stop at the intersection and wait for the lights to turn green before continuing. Lastly, white metal barriers are installed on both sides of the road, signifying that the roadway is off-limits to pedestrians and cyclists. This helps minimize the risk of incidents involving vulnerable road users and allows the ego car to concentrate on managing risks presented by vehicular traffic."

The presence of this traffic cone suggests there might be some form of road work or hazard ahead, prompting the ego car to potentially adjust its speed or change lanes to avoid the indicated area.",
