The truck is large, with a rotating drum and marked with reflective safety stickers. Its presence and size dictate the speed and immediate driving options for the ego vehicle, as it takes up a significant portion of the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light visible above the road in the distance, which is currently red. This indicates that the ego vehicle must prepare to stop at the intersection ahead.\n\nOther objects in the scene include street lamps and utility poles beside the road. However, these are standard parts of the roadside environment and do not influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, as they do not pose an immediate hazard or require any driving action. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in this image that affect the driving conditions."
