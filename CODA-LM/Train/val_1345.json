This obstruction could force the ego car to slow down or change lanes to avoid collision. Also ahead, there is a sedan directly in front of the ego car within the same lane, requiring the ego car to be alert for any potential sudden stops or lane changes from the sedan. Additionally, although multiple vehicles can be seen in the oncoming traffic lane, they currently do not affect the driving behavior of the ego car but must be watched vigilantly for any maneuvers that might cross into the ego car's path.\n\nFor traffic navigation, there's an overhead directional signboard on the right indicating a Vehicle Management Station and the distance to it in meters. This information is not immediately pertinent to the driving behavior. Similarly, blue rectangular road signs are present on the right side indicating directions to nearby locations, and these are intended for navigation without requiring immediate action by the ego car.\n\nLastly, a metal barrier is positioned between the oncoming traffic lane and the ego car's lane, and it separates a sidewalk on the right as well. This barrier clearly demarcates the driving lane for the ego car and implies that the vehicle must either stay in the current lane or change lanes to the right if necessary. \n\nThe traffic scene is devoid of any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects that would otherwise affect driving behavior or conditions."

Use caution due to the barriers which limit maneuverability to the right lane change if it's safe and clear."
