These vehicles appear to be cars and are not currently in motion as there are no lights visible. Reflective surfaces on the vehicles can be noticed, which could catch the attention of other drivers. For the safety of the ego car, it's essential to maintain a safe distance from these parked vehicles. This precaution helps to avert any collisions and provides a buffer zone for unexpected incidents such as car doors opening or pedestrians stepping out from between the parked cars. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects depicted in this image that need to be considered."

This car will influence the driving behavior of the ego vehicle by requiring the driver to maintain a safe distance and potentially slow down to navigate through the narrower driving path. The cars location increases the need for heightened attention, especially in a dark environment, to avoid accidental collisions with it or any movement around it, such as doors opening or sudden entry of another vehicle or pedestrian from behind it.",
