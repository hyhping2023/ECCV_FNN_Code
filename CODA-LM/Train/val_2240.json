        "description and explanation": "The image shows a construction area with several notable road users and hazards. On the right-hand side of the road, a large yellow articulated boom lift is positioned diagonally across the driving lane, with its stabilizing legs extended and the platform raised. This construction vehicle is performing an operation and obstructing part of the road, necessitating cautious maneuvering by the ego car. On the left side of the road, a yellow bulldozer with its shovel raised is facing perpendicular to the ego car's trajectory, signaling ongoing construction work that may disrupt traffic flow and require the ego vehicle to be vigilant. Additionally, a white SUV is parked in the background on the right side of the road, parallel and in the same direction as the ego car, contributing to the narrowed driving path due to the construction equipment.\n\nSeveral construction workers are visible around the construction equipment, wearing reflective vests. These workers present potential hazards as they may enter the roadway or be in close proximity, demanding that the ego vehicle slow down and exercise extreme caution. Also, construction-related debris or objects may be present around the construction vehicles and workers, representing additional hazards that require careful navigation by the ego vehicle to avoid.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a mobile crane. It is identified by its large yellow body, an adjustable boom arm that can extend vertically, and a cabin for an operator. This crane is typically used in construction sites to lift heavy materials and transport them to different heights or locations. For the ego car, encountering such a vehicle could indicate the presence of nearby construction activity. The ego car should proceed with increased caution, potentially reducing speed and being prepared for unexpected obstacles or changes in the flow of traffic, such as workers on the road or temporary road signs.",

This equipment suggests that construction work is actively occurring in the area, which may lead to potential obstacles or changes in normal traffic patterns.

The driver should be ready to maneuver around the boom lift by cautiously changing lanes if it is safe to do so, or wait for a construction worker's signal to pass. The vehicle should also maintain a safe following distance and be vigilant for any sudden movements from the construction workers or newly appearing obstacles. Use of hazard lights may be advised to alert other road users to the ego vehicle's reduced speed and increased caution in this area."
