        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two notable vehicles. The first is an orange heavy tow truck directly ahead in the same lane. It is easily identifiable with clear branding and the number 295 on its rear. This truck is particularly important for the ego car to be aware of as it takes up space in the lane and its large size could potentially hide other road users or changes in the road conditions that are ahead. The second vehicle is a white commercial truck parked on the right side of the road with its hazard lights on. This truck is partially blocking the rightmost lane, which could force other vehicles to merge into the ego car's lane in order to bypass it, presenting a possible hazard.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the scene.\n\nHowever, there are bicycles parked on the sidewalk to the right. These indicate that cyclists might be in the area, and there is a possibility that they may enter the road unpredictably, which requires additional vigilance from the ego car."

Given its presence and size, it may be moving slowly or making frequent stops. The future driving behavior of the ego car should include maintaining a safe distance to accommodate sudden or unexpected stops and reduced speeds of the construction vehicle, ensuring ample time and space for safe maneuvers around the vehicle.",
