Additionally, numerous vehicles are present in the opposite lanes, moving in the reverse direction, but they are separated by a median and do not impact the ego car's immediate driving decisions. There is also a dark car in the leftmost lane on the same side as the median, which the ego car needs to monitor in case it changes lanes or adjusts speed.\n\nAs for signage, a no-parking sign on the left side of the road indicates parking restrictions, but since it's not a parking scenario, it does not influence the ego vehicle's immediate driving behavior. Directional signs above the lanes help the ego vehicle determine the correct lane for its destination. There is a blue sign with a bicycle symbol on the right, signaling the presence of a bike lane or shared path, which means the ego vehicle must be vigilant for any cyclists.\n\nRegarding traffic signals, the red lights hanging over the intersection require the ego car to stop if it intends to continue straight. However, a green arrow allows vehicles to turn right with caution.\n\nOn the roadside, orange and white traffic cones suggest road work or lane closures, signaling to the ego car to avoid the coned-off area and be ready for potential lane narrowing or nearby workers. Lastly, a median barrier prevents traffic from crossing into the opposing lanes, ensuring the ego car stays on the correct side.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."
