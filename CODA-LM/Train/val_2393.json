Therefore, the ego car must exercise caution and possibly stop or slow down.\n\nA concrete barrier appears to the left of the wheel loader, possibly indicating roadwork or lane separation. This barrier limits the maneuverability of the ego car, meaning it must remain in its current lane and cannot pass the wheel loader on the left side.\n\nAdditionally, debris can be seen on the right side of the road adjacent to the wheel loader, suggesting recent or ongoing construction work. This road debris is a driving hazard, requiring the ego car to navigate around it while also monitoring for additional debris that the construction vehicle may create."

            "description and explanation": "The object labeled as 'construction_vehicle' refers to a wheel loader, commonly used in construction environments for moving or loading materials such as asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, or gravel. It has distinct large tires and a useful articulated steering system, often with an attachment at the front for moving material. Its presence on a road can influence driving behavior by increasing the need for vigilance as this type of vehicle may make unexpected movements, require wider turning radiuses, or may be entering or exiting construction sites.",

This particular type appears to be a dump truck, characterized by its open-box bed at the back, which is used to transport loose materials such as sand or gravel. When encountered on the road, this vehicle necessitates cautious driving and increased following distance due to its large size and potentially loose debris falling from the open back, which can pose a hazard for vehicles trailing close behind.",

The car should not attempt to overtake the loader due to the barrier on the left side of the road and the potential for dropped debris. Turning on the hazard lights until safely past the construction activity may also be prudent to alert following traffic to the potential hazard."
