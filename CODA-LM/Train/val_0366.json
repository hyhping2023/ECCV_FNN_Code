Further down the road, more vehicles are spotted including a white bus on the left side and another white vehicle on the right, both moving away from the ego car, which could affect the traffic flow and lane choices as the ego car approaches.\n\nRegarding the traffic signs, there is a blue directional sign on the left with a white arrow indicating a lane for left turns, guiding the ego car to choose the appropriate lane for its planned route. Additionally, a 'no stopping' sign on the right side prohibits stopping in the area it covers, thereby the ego car is obliged not to halt in that zone.\n\nAbove the intersection, traffic lights showing a green signal for the lanes going straight allow legal passage through the intersection, meaning the ego car can proceed as long as the conditions are safe and within the speed limits.\n\nMetal barriers can be seen on both left and right sides of the road, which define the drivable area and prevent vehicles from accessing certain parts of the road to ensure safety.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects are reported in the scene."
