        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several notable elements that impact the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, there is a large bus directly ahead of the ego car. The bus's brake lights are illuminated, indicating that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego car either slows down or prepares to stop as well, to maintain a safe distance from the bus.\n\nAdditionally, in the right lane slightly ahead of the ego car, the taillights of another vehicle are visible. This indicates that the vehicle is either moving in the same direction as the ego car or is stopped. The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to exercise caution, as its actions, such as a sudden stop or lane change, could directly influence the maneuvering decisions of the ego car, including lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic sign visible above the bus. This directional sign, possibly indicating lane divisions or an exit, provides essential navigation information that will aid in the route planning decisions of the ego car.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the road, traffic cones are arranged in a line that appears to be narrowing the drivable portion of the roadway. These cones are indicative of a potential road hazard or construction area. Consequently, they necessitate that the ego car may need to adjust its lane position or reduce its speed to safely navigate past the hazard.\n\nIn this traffic scene, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that influence driving behavior or require attention. This summary encompasses the critical elements present in the image that have significant implications on the autonomous driving decisions of the ego car."

It is orange in color, which makes it highly visible in various lighting conditions, and often features a reflective strip to enhance visibility during nighttime or in low-light environments. The placement of this cone on the roadway informs the ego car to be cautious and possibly indicates an area where lane usage might be restricted, necessitating a reduction in speed or a change in driving path to ensure safety.",

Following distance should be increased, especially due to wet road conditions. Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to adjust its lane position gently to avoid the narrowed roadway indicated by the traffic cones. Overall, the ego car should reduce speed and proceed with heightened caution to handle potential changes in traffic flow and road conditions."
