However, there is a pedestrian with a dog, who is currently crossing the road at a zebra crossing directly in front of the ego vehicle, about halfway across the lane which the ego vehicle occupies. This pedestrian with the dog has the right of way, and considering the presence of the dog, their movements may be somewhat unpredictable. The ego vehicle must take into account this pedestrian's presence when deciding its next move, making sure to yield appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign observed. A traffic signal, displaying a red light, is situated on the right side of the intersection. This red light is an indication for the ego vehicle to come to a stop if it is nearing the stop line or the intersection. The vehicleâ€™s behavior is thereby dictated by the need to obey the traffic signal, ensuring it halts as required by the traffic rules.\n\nNo other road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported in the scene, therefore, those categories are not considered in the current traffic setting."

As a driver or autonomous system of the ego car, recognizing this pedestrian is crucial for ensuring safety. The presence of the pedestrian influences driving behavior by necessitating a reduction in speed and possibly coming to a complete stop to allow the pedestrian to cross the road safely, adhering to traffic laws that prioritize pedestrian right-of-way in crosswalks.",

The ego car must approach with caution, potentially reducing speed and preparing to stop.

Additionally, the red traffic light confirms that the ego car must wait until the signal changes to green before proceeding through the intersection. It is advisable to remain alert for any other potential hazards or road users that may not be immediately visible due to the glare from the sun at the current time of day. Drive attentively and carefully resume driving once the pedestrian has cleared the crossing and the light turns green."
