Descriptions and explanations for each observed road user are as follows:\n\nThe vehicles include a white passenger car located behind a large construction vehicle on the road. The white car must maintain a safe following distance due to the size of the construction vehicle ahead, and it should be prepared to stop or maneuver around should the construction vehicle make unexpected movements.\n\nAdditionally, there is an orange construction/utility vehicle parked on the road. As it appears to be stationary, likely due to ongoing maintenance or repair work, it is obstructing part of the lane. This situation calls for heightened awareness and caution for passing vehicles.\n\nA barrier in the scene is represented by a large construction vehicle equipped with an elevated platform and warning lights. It occupies part of the lane and functions as a temporary barrier. Consequently, the ego vehicle has to be vigilant and carefully navigate around this obstruction to continue safely on its route.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present or identified in the image."
