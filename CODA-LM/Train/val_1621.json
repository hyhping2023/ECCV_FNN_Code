        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, various road users and objects are present, each influencing driving behavior and decision-making in distinct ways.\n\nA white car is noted traveling in the opposite lane and direction. While it currently poses no direct threat, it is essential to keep an eye on it as its movements can alter the dynamic of the surrounding environment.\n\nPedestrians are seen under an umbrella by the roadside, introducing an element of unpredictability. As they are near the driving lane, there's a need for cautious driving to accommodate any sudden movements they might make, such as attempting to cross the road.\n\nA \"No parking\" sign is prominently displayed on the right side of the road. This sign explicitly warns against stopping or parking along that stretch of the road, signaling that the vehicle should continue its journey without pausing in the indicated area.\n\nInterestingly, there are no traffic lights within the visible range. This absence requires the autonomous vehicle to depend more heavily on the observed road signs and markings to guide its movements and decisions.\n\nLastly, raindrops are observed covering the windshield, a condition that notably diminishes visibility. This weather condition demands reduced speed and heightened attention to the road to ensure safe navigation through the area.\n\nNo traffic cones or barriers are present in the scene, suggesting no immediate obstructions or alterations to the standard lane pathways that need to be navigated around."

The primary purpose of a traffic light is to control the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections or designated crossing areas to ensure safety and efficiency on the roads. In this scenario, the display of the green light influences the ego car to continue moving forward without requiring a stop, as the signal indicates it's safe and legally appropriate to do so under current traffic conditions.",
