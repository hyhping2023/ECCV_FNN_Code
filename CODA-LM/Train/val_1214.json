Firstly, there is a white van on the right side of the road facing the ego car, which is partially on the road. The presence of this van is significant because it might be slowing down, stopping, or preparing to merge into traffic, all of which could affect the ego car's path and speed. Additionally, there is a truck with a red cab and a loaded bed on the right side, moving away from the ego car. This truck is important to consider as it occupies the lane that the ego car might need for overtaking or avoiding obstacles.\n\nThere are also orange traffic cones on the right side of the road, which delineate a work zone or a road hazard. These cones suggest that there may be road work taking place or a road hazard present, requiring the ego car to potentially slow down and merge left if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, makeshift barriers, including piles of bricks and a low wall, are present to the right. These barriers indicate construction or changes in the road layout, which could affect traffic flow and necessitate caution.\n\nLastly, there are objects and materials on the right side of the road next to the makeshift barriers. These items could unexpectedly enter the road or cause distractions, requiring the ego car to drive carefully.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights reported in the image."
