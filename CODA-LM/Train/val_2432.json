This might require the ego car to slow down or change lanes. Reflective traffic cones are also seen forming a line that converges into the lane of the ego car from the right, suggesting a lane closure or narrowing ahead, requiring vehicles to merge left. Bright red and white barriers are present on the right side of the road, partially entering the driving lane. These barriers are directing traffic away from the worksite and into the adjoining lane to ensure safety. Additionally, there is an illuminated work area on the right, with possible construction equipment or personnel. Activity in this area could lead to unexpected obstacles or road users entering the driving lane. There are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, or traffic lights present in the image."
