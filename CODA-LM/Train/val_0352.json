        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, a variety of road users and objects are present, influencing the behavior of the autonomous ego car.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a blue car executing a right turn onto a road adjacent to the ego car's lane. This maneuver affects the traffic flow, potentially obstructing the ego car's intended path should it wish to continue straight or take the same right turn.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are a few noteworthy observations. Firstly, three pedestrians, including a child on a bicycle, are utilizing the crosswalk directly in the path of the ego car. The ego car is mandated to yield to them as they rightfully have precedence in the crosswalk. Additionally, another individual is spotted waiting to cross the street, situated on the right side of the approaching crosswalk. The ego car must remain vigilant towards this person as they might enter the crosswalk, necessitating the car to halt.\n\nConcerning traffic signs, two specific instances are noted. Overhead directional signs are seen, pointing out lanes leading to Biwen Rd. and Binkang Rd., essential for the ego car's navigation towards its destination. Also observed is a 'No entry' sign affixed to a roadside barrier on the left, indicating a prohibition against entering the lane directly opposite the sign. This is crucial for the ego car to note, especially if considering a lane change to the left.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, their presence is confirmed in the distance, though their current state remains uncertain from this viewpoint. As a result, the ego car is advised to approach with caution, ready to comply with the signal once its status becomes evidently clear.\n\nOrange traffic cones noted on the left of the ego vehicle serve to demarcate lanes and signal areas off-limits or with restricted access, ensuring smooth traffic flow and safety.\n\nLastly, roadside barriers are positioned on the left side of the scene, equipped with 'No entry' signs. These barriers serve as a signal of a closed or restricted lane that the ego car must acknowledge and respond to accordingly.\n\nThe scene lacks any other objects of notable impact or relevance to the driving conditions for the ego car."
