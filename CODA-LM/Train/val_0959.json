On the left side of the ego car, there is a cement mixer truck traveling in the same direction. The large size of the truck and its potential for wide turns require the ego car to maintain extra space and exercise caution. Ahead on the right, there is a white sedan also moving in the same direction as the ego car. The sedan's proximity and trajectory influence the ego car's decisions regarding lane choice and following distance. Additionally, there are vehicles on the opposite side of the road moving in the opposite direction, which the ego car must observe carefully, especially when considering crossing the median line.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a \"No left turn\" sign on the right side at the intersection ahead, which prohibits the ego car from turning left at that intersection. The traffic light for the ego car's direction is green, allowing the ego car to proceed straight or turn right, but not left due to the aforementioned traffic sign.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a fenced construction area that alerts the ego car to potential obstructions or changes in road width. Also on the right, before the intersection, there is a red forklift parked. While the forklift is not an immediate threat, it is an unusual object, and the ego car should be cautious in case it becomes operational or if there is movement around it.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other categories of objects present in the image that would affect the ego car's driving behavior."
