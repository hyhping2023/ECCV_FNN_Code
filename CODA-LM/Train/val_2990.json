Firstly, there is a sedan directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights illuminated, signaling that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to slow down or stop as necessary. Additionally, a truck is present in the left lane, ahead of the ego car, with its tail lights visible. This indicates that the ego car should remain aware of the truck's presence and speed to anticipate potential lane changes or slowing traffic.\n\nFurthermore, overhead traffic lights displaying a red color are observed at a distance in front of the ego car. This necessitates that the ego car must prepare to come to a complete stop at the traffic light. Traffic cones are also placed on the right side of the ego car's lane, indicating a lane closure or potential road works ahead. As a result, the ego car is advised not to change lanes to the right and should proceed with caution, being prepared for any sudden stops or deviations in the path due to the lane closure.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image, indicating that these categories do not influence the current driving scenario for the ego car."
