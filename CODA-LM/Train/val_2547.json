As an autonomous vehicle, it is critical to maintain a safe following distance from this white car and be alert to any sudden stops or lane changes that may occur.\n\nAdditionally, there's a car parked on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle must navigate past this parked car by maintaining an adequate lateral distance to ensure safety while overtaking.\n\nLastly, there is a pedestrian observed standing on the sidewalk near the parked car. The pedestrian poses a potential hazard as they may decide to cross the road. Therefore, the autonomous driving system needs to monitor the pedestrian closely and be prepared to react to any unexpected movements. \n\nThe traffic image contains no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects to consider. Hence, the autonomous vehicle can focus on the aforementioned road users to manage the immediate driving scenario safely."
