Several cars are also traveling in the left lane in the same direction as the ego car, at various distances. The ego car needs to be aware of these vehicles, their speeds, and lane positions to navigate safely and anticipate any potential lane changes or slowing of traffic.\n\nThere are construction warning signs placed on the right side of the road, indicating a construction zone ahead. The ego car should be prepared for potential obstacles, workers, or changes in traffic patterns.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are arranged along the right side of the right lane, which signal a lane closure or worksite ahead. This setup guides the ego car to stay in the left lane and proceed with caution.\n\nMetal barriers are present on both sides of the highway, suggesting it is a limited-access road with no pedestrian access. These barriers represent fixed road boundaries that the ego car should recognize and stay within to remain on the roadway."
