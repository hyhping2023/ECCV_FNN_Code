The presence and movement of the white SUV are critical as they directly influence the ego car's speed and lane positioning. To ensure safety, the ego car must maintain an appropriate following distance from the SUV, adjusting its speed accordingly.\n\nSecondly, a pedestrian is spotted walking along the side of the road, near the sidewalk. This situation demands heightened caution from the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the road means that the ego car must be prepared to reduce speed or take evasive action if necessary to ensure the pedestrian's safety, especially if they unexpectedly step onto the road.\n\nNo other road users, including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the image, indicating a relatively clear path ahead, barring the need to monitor the SUV and pedestrian closely."
