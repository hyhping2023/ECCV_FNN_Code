A white car driving in the oncoming lane to the left of the ego car, facing towards the camera. This car requires monitoring as it is moving in the opposite direction, and the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the median strip to avoid any potential hazards.\n2. A white vehicle directly ahead of the ego car in the same lane, maintaining lane discipline. The ego car should observe this vehicle closely for any changes in speed or lane changes that could affect the ego car's path.\n3. A yellow vehicle visible in the distance in the center lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Though further away, this vehicle's actions are important to observe in case of sudden stops or turns that could affect traffic flow.\n\nThere is one vulnerable road user:\n- A bicyclist on the right-hand side of the road, riding in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car must maintain a safe passing distance from the cyclist and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid a close encounter.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the image.\n\nThere is one other object:\n- A line of parked bicycles on the sidewalk to the right. While these do not directly influence the ego car's driving path, being aware of people who may potentially step out from between the bicycles onto the road is important."

Be prepared to change lanes if necessary to maintain safe distance or to overtake, but only if it is safe to do so and observing the usual rules of the road. Watch for any changes in behavior from the oncoming white vehicle and the yellow vehicle further ahead, as these may affect traffic flow. Stay vigilant for the bicyclist on the right and ensure they are given enough room when passing. Continue to monitor the parked bicycles on the right for any pedestrian activity that may enter into the roadway, and adjust speed and position accordingly if needed to ensure safety."
