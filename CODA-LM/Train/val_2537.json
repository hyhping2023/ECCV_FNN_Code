Directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car is a large concrete mixer truck with a white and grey color scheme and safety stripes. This truck partially obstructs the view ahead, influencing the ego car's ability to overtake or maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a silver sedan is in the left lane adjacent to the ego car, facing the same direction and positioned slightly ahead. The presence of this vehicle must be considered to maintain safe lane discipline and prevent a side collision.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the intersection, a person on a scooter is waiting at the curb. This road user may enter the road after the traffic light changes, requiring the ego car to monitor the scooter rider's movement. Near this scooter rider, pedestrians are standing on the sidewalk. Although they are not currently on the roadway, their presence suggests potential pedestrian crossing activity when the signal permits.\n\nAt the intersection, multiple traffic lights are visible, all showing red signals. These red lights require the ego car to stop at the intersection until the signal changes to green.\n\nA median barrier is present, separating the opposing traffic lanes. This barrier guides traffic flow and prevents any vehicles from the opposing direction from entering the lane of the ego car."

Its presence indicates active construction or maintenance work in the vicinity, which means the ego car should remain vigilant for potential stops, slow-moving traffic, or sudden changes in the flow of traffic. The construction vehicle's larger size and the operational nature can also mean it might make unexpected maneuvers, necessitating increased distance between it and the ego car to ensure safe reaction times and to mitigate collision risks.",

Waiting until the intersection is clear and the light is green is the safest course of action."
