It appears either parked or moving slowly as its rear lights are active, suggesting that it may be braking or standing still. Due to its proximity and uncertain status, the ego vehicle needs to be ready to navigate around the car carefully or be prepared to stop if the car moves unexpectedly onto the roadway.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are red and white reflective traffic cones set up, indicating an area that should be avoided. The presence of these cones typically means there could be road works, a closure, or an obstacle present, and the ego vehicle should be ready to change lanes or reduce speed accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a series of solid barriers can be observed running parallel to the right side of the road, which reduces the available width for maneuvering the vehicle. These barriers dictate that road users cannot enter or exit the roadway from the right side, which narrows the drivable path and can affect the flow of traffic, requiring heightened attention and careful driving from the ego vehicle.\n\nLastly, there is a billboard situated behind the barriers which is part of the surrounding environment but does not affect the driving scenario. There are no visible road debris or other objects that might impact the driving decisions of the ego vehicle."
