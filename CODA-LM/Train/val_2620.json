It is parallel to the road and facing away from the ego vehicle. The forklift's position suggests it may be pulled over or conducting work, which could cause an obstruction or unexpected movement, affecting the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light visible straight ahead at the intersection, indicating that vehicles are allowed to proceed. The ego car can legally enter the intersection, provided the way is clear of other road users and obstructions.\n\nFurthermore, a green mesh barrier is present on the side of the road to the left of the ego vehicle. This barrier likely signifies construction or a work area adjacent to the road. The presence of barriers may indicate the presence of workers or machinery near the driving path, necessitating increased caution from the ego car.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."

Such vehicles are commonly used in construction zones or for transporting heavy materials. The presence of a construction vehicle on the road indicates active construction work nearby, suggesting the need for reduced speeds and increased awareness from drivers to ensure safety.
