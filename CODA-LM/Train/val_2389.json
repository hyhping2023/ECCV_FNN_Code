        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a single vehicle present, which significantly impacts the dynamics and safety considerations of the environment. The vehicle in question is a white van, identified as being parked on the right side of the road and facing towards the ego vehicle. The description suggests that the van might be either in the process of unloading goods or temporarily stationary without the driver's immediate attention to it. The critical aspect of its presence relates to the potential safety hazards it poses. Specifically, the parked van could compel oncoming traffic to veer into the path of the ego car, increasing the likelihood of a collision. Additionally, there's a risk associated with the possibility of the van's door suddenly opening into the roadway, which would further obstruct the flow of traffic and potentially endanger nearby road users. The scene is devoid of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other miscellaneous objects that might otherwise influence or affect driving conditions."
