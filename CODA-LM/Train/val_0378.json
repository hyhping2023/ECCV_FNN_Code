This bus may start moving soon as it might be finishing a passenger exchange, which could result in it merging into the ego car's lane.\n\nSecondly, the ego car is sharing the road with multiple passenger vehicles positioned in front and in the adjacent lanes at a traffic signal. These vehicles' behaviors will dictate how the ego car can proceed through the intersection once the traffic light changes.\n\nFurthermore, there's a directional traffic sign installed above the road that indicates the proper lanes for straight travel and for making right turns. This sign helps the ego car to identify and select the appropriate lane to follow its intended route.\n\nIn addition to these elements, a red traffic light is visible directly in front of the ego car, and it requires the vehicle to stay stationary until the signal turns green.\n\nLastly, an orange traffic cone has been positioned on the road next to the bus on the left side, which could be marking road work or some kind of hazard. This indicates that there might be a lane closure or a need to merge, potentially affecting lane usage as the ego car moves forward.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, barriers, and other objects seem to have no representatives in this scene, as their respective lists are empty in the provided JSON data."

The cone can also indicate a temporary boundary or to guard against potential danger spots to ensure drivers maneuver safely.
