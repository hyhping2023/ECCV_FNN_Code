The ego car must consequently maintain an appropriate following distance and be ready to stop as necessary. In front of the ego car is a white sedan that also has its brake lights illuminated, indicating a decrease in speed or a complete stop. It is important for the ego car to keep a close watch on this vehicle's movements to match speed or come to a stop as required. Additionally, there are multiple cars in the right lane that are traveling at the normal speed of traffic. Caution is advised for the ego car regarding these vehicles in case any attempt to merge into its lane is made.\n\nAhead, over the intersection, there is a traffic light displaying a red signal for all lanes, necessitating that the ego car stop at the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nOn the road in front of the barrier on the left side, orange traffic cones are arranged, denoting the presence of construction work or some form of a road hazard. This mandates that the ego car stay within its lane, avoiding navigation around the cones or barrier to prevent potential traffic infringements or collisions.\n\nFurthermore, there is a yellow barrier installed on the left pedestrian crossing section. This likely points to a closure or a non-usable crossing for pedestrians. The presence of this barrier should not impact the ego car as long as it remains within the traffic lanes designated for vehicle use.\n\nThe summary includes all non-empty categories observed in the scene. There are no mentions of vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects as these categories were empty in the JSON data, signifying an absence of such elements in the traffic image."
