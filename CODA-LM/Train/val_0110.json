There are vehicles, including a white van and a white car in the left lane traveling in the same direction as the ego car and at a safe distance ahead. The ego car should continue to maintain this safe following distance, as these vehicles do not currently present a threat. Additionally, several stationary vehicles appear on the right, facing a direction opposite to the ego car or potentially parked. Despite not being direct obstacles, the ego car has to stay vigilant for any movements from these vehicles.\n\nWhile there are no vulnerable road users like pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists present in the image, it's still crucial for the ego car to remain alert to these users' possible sudden appearance.\n\nTraffic signs in the image include a \"No Parking\" sign under an overpass to the right, and a roundabout-ahead warning on a blue directional sign. The former informs the ego car that it should not stop or park under the overpass, while the latter prepares the vehicle for the correct maneuvering needed at the upcoming roundabout.\n\nThe image also includes a red traffic light straight ahead, enforcing the requirement for the ego car to stop and wait for it to turn green before proceeding.\n\nObservably, there are red and white traffic cones on the right side, defining the driving boundary to alert drivers to stay within the lane limits and avoid restricted areas.\n\nFinally, bicycles parked on the sidewalk to the far right don't pose a direct impediment to vehicle traffic, but their presence is noted in case pedestrians moving toward them become relevant to the ego car's driving strategy."
