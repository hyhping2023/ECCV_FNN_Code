        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image we're analyzing, there are several noteworthy features represented in distinct categories. Starting with vehicles, there's a white van directly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle. It maintains a moderate distance and, due to its proximity, its speed and actions will directly influence the ego vehicle's driving decisions. Additionally, a blue car is parked on the road's right side with its hazard lights activated, signaling a potential obstacle or situation affecting road conditions, even though it's not directly in the path of the ego vehicle.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are pedestrians observed under umbrellas positioned on both the sidewalk to the right and in the crosswalk to the left. These pedestrians warrant special attention as they could unexpectedly step into the roadway, posing immediate concerns for the ego vehicle's path.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there's a crosswalk sign on the right side of the road, indicating an area where pedestrians might cross, especially given the wet conditions implied by the use of umbrellas. This sign is a crucial alert for the driver to exercise increased caution.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene show a green light ahead for the ego vehicle's lane, giving the go-ahead to proceed. However, the driver should remain vigilant and prepared to stop should the light change.\n\nLastly, the category of other objects includes a small, possibly yellow object near the parked cars on the road to the right. The exact nature of this object is unclear, making it a potential road hazard that must be considered while navigating.\n\nIn this scenario, no traffic cones or barriers appear in the image, suggesting no immediate impact from such objects on the current driving conditions."

In the context of the image, a bollard is present on the side of the road.
