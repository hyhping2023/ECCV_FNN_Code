        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are several road users and objects of interest. Firstly, there is a white sedan on the left side of the ego car, which is partially obstructing the lane. The sedan is positioned diagonally, indicating it might be parked or about to move. This situation requires the ego car to be prepared for the sedan's potential movement, which could affect the ego car's driving path.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, there is a large black SUV occupying the same lane and moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to ensure a safe following distance from the SUV to avoid any collisions.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple cars parked on both sides of the street. These parked cars create a narrow passage, which both the ego car and oncoming traffic must carefully navigate. The presence of these parked cars reduces the available space for maneuvering and can limit visibility, thus requiring the ego car to drive cautiously.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there is a pedestrian who is currently not interacting with the roadway but is engaged in other activities. Although the pedestrian is not an immediate concern, their presence is noted since pedestrians can be unpredictable and may enter the roadway without warning.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Since there are no visible traffic signs or signals, the ego vehicle should follow standard road rules and be prepared to stop or yield at the pedestrian crossing."
