A truck with a flatbed trailer is ahead in the same lane to the right of the crane, also likely affecting traffic flow. The proximity of the flatbed truck to the ego car may necessitate a speed adjustment or lane change.\n3.

            "description and explanation": "This is a large yellow construction vehicle, specifically a mobile crane mounted on a truck chassis. It features multiple axles to support its heavy weight and a sizable, telescoping boom crane used for lifting operations at construction sites. Its presence on the road suggests that there might be construction activity nearby, or the vehicle is moving between work sites. As a result, the driving behavior of the ego car should be cautious and alert to sudden stops or slow movement from this vehicle, and possibly anticipate lane changes or diversions around construction areas.",

The ego car should also be prepared for the large mobile crane's potential turning movements and refrain from changing lanes due to the semi truck in the adjacent lane. Compliance with the 40 km/h speed limit sign should be adhered to once the light turns green and it is safe to proceed."
