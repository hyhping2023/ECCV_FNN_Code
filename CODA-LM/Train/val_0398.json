        "description and explanation": "The image shows a green truck on the right side of the road, which appears to be stationary due to the presence of traffic cones indicating construction or road work. Its large size and stationary position partly obstruct one lane, which may require vehicles to merge left. There is also a yellow vehicle with warning lights on the far left. This vehicle is likely to be a maintenance or construction vehicle due to its warning lights and position near the traffic cones and barriers, indicating ongoing work which might affect traffic flow.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is an overhead electronic sign displaying a red 'X' over the right lane along with a numerical countdown. The red 'X' on the overhead sign indicates that the right lane ahead is closed to traffic. The numerical countdown suggests a time-sensitive event or controlled traffic condition approaching. There is also a road sign indicating a right turn lane. The blue road sign on the right side with a white arrow indicates that the lane is dedicated for right turns, which helps in understanding lane usage and making appropriate lane changes in advance.\n\nA line of traffic cones is visible on the right side extending from the green truck towards the tunnel. These cones indicate that part of the right lane is cordoned off for roadwork or an obstruction, directing traffic to move left or slow down as they approach the work zone. Alongside the cones, there are red and white striped barriers on the right. These barriers provide a visible physical separation for the construction or maintenance work zone, reinforcing the redirection of the traffic flow. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users or other objects in the image."
