This truck may be moving slowly due to its heavy load, potentially causing congestion and requiring the ego car to either slow down or change lanes. Additionally, there is a white truck on the right side of the ego car, slightly ahead and occupying the shoulder or possibly a right-turn lane. This indicates potential merging or turning movements that the ego car should be prepared for. Overhead, there are green directional signs indicating a junction with directions for G302, along with distances and speed limits. These signs provide crucial information about upcoming routes and speed regulations that the ego car must observe."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large truck loaded with construction machinery, specifically a yellow excavator. When driving near such vehicles, it's crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe distance due to the potential for sudden stops or debris falling from the flatbed. The presence of heavy equipment on the truck also indicates that it might make unexpected maneuvers, such as wide turns, which can affect the passing ability and safety for vehicles around it. Therefore, the ego car should monitor this truck's movements closely and possibly adjust speed or change lanes to ensure safety.",

It appears to be transporting heavy equipment, evident from the visible crane mounted atop one of its compartments. The presence of this truck in front of the ego car influences the driving behavior by requiring the driver to maintain a safe following distance. Given the size and potential slow speed of the truck, especially when carrying heavy loads, the ego car must be cautious and prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to avoid close following and ensure safety.",

Monitoring the white truck's indicators and position is essential for predicting its movements and reacting accordingly. The ego car should follow the speed regulations indicated by the signs and prepare for any maneuvers required to follow the G302 or to take any other route as planned. Lane changes should be executed with caution, using appropriate signaling and ensuring the adjacent lanes are clear of traffic."
