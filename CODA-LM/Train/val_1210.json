Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a large green vehicle, which could be a construction truck or similar machinery. Due to its size and the possibility of it moving slowly, it may impact the flow of traffic, necessitating a lane change or speed adjustment by the ego car. In the left lane adjacent to the ego car, there is a silver SUV slightly ahead and traveling in the same direction. The SUV's position restricts the ego car's ability to safely change lanes to the left without an adequate gap. Additionally, a white van is present in the right lane, slightly behind and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car needs to keep an eye on the van to avoid any potential side collisions if the van decides to overtake.\n\nFurthermore, there is a traffic light ahead displaying a red signal over the ego car's lane, signaling that the ego car should be ready to stop if it can do so safely. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."

No immediate lane change is advisable until the traffic light turns green or the road situation changes."
