The car is stationary and doesn't directly affect the ego car's current path. However, the possibility that the driver of the parked car could return and enter the roadway must be taken into account. While multiple street lights are present, providing illumination for the road, there are no traffic lights visible in the image. This means that the autonomous system of the ego car can continue driving with attention to road conditions, keeping an eye out for any traffic signals that may appear further along the route. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that could influence the ego car's driving behavior."

Positioned directly in the lane ahead of the ego vehicle, it influences driving behavior by setting the pace which the ego car must follow or maintain a safe distance from. The presence of this car mandates that the ego car might need to adjust its speed or switch lanes to overtake if necessary, while also constantly monitoring for any changes in its brake lights, which would signal deceleration or a halt.",
