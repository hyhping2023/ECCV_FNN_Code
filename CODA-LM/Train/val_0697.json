Firstly, there is a white car approaching the intersection from the opposite direction. The ego car should remain vigilant for potential turns or stops made by this vehicle. Additionally, there are various parked cars on both sides of the street, which narrow the drivable space. The ego car must navigate cautiously as there is a risk of doors opening or cars pulling out unexpectedly.\n\nA truck is also visible in the distance ahead on the same road. The ego car should monitor the truck's speed and intentions, as it may need to overtake or maintain a safe following distance.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a speed limit sign indicating a maximum of 30 km/h. The ego car is required to adhere to this speed limit to ensure safety and compliance with traffic laws.\n\nLastly, there are dustbins located on the sidewalk to the left. Although they are not on the road and do not pose an immediate hazard, if any were to be in the path of the ego car, they could become a risk that would necessitate avoidance maneuvers."
