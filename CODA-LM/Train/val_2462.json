In this context, the traffic cone's purpose is likely to indicate a hazard or demarcation for roadwork or an accident scene that drivers need to avoid. Accordingly, drivers should reduce their speed and proceed with increased caution, potentially changing lanes if necessary to maintain a safe distance from the obstacle indicated by the cone.",
