This van is occupying the lane next to the ego car and could potentially change lanes or create blind spots. Additionally, directly in front of the ego car, a blue and transparent bus shelter appears stationary, blocking the direct path and necessitating navigation around it.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a cyclist is moving in the same direction as the traffic. Since cyclists are more vulnerable and can affect traffic flow, the ego car must maintain a safe distance.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is located on the right side of the road, indicating a crossing zone ahead. To ensure safety, the ego car must be prepared to yield to pedestrians that might be crossing.\n\nOrange and white striped barriers are also observed on the right side, demarcating a construction or no-entry zone. These barriers signify that the area is restricted, and the ego car must not enter these zones."

In the present scenario, it is positioned ahead of the ego car and occupies a significant part of the driving lane. As a slower-moving vehicle, the presence of the tricycle directly impacts the driving behavior of the ego car. The driver of the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the tricycle to accommodate its typically slower speed and potential sudden stops. Additionally, the driver should be prepared for the possibility of the tricycle making unexpected moves, such as turns or side shifts, without significant signaling.",
