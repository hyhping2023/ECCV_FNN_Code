This car's proximity will determine if the ego car needs to adjust its speed to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a motorcyclist in an adjacent lane to the right of the ego car, also moving in the same direction. It is crucial for the ego car to keep track of the motorcyclist's movements in case they change lanes or perform any other maneuvers. On the right-hand side of the road, there are yellow temporary traffic barriers marking a construction zone. These barriers are causing a merge to the left lane and signify a reduction in road width as well as merge points that the ego car must recognize and respond to accordingly. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects detailed in the scene."

It is typically utilized to guide drivers safely around construction zones or other hazards on the road, ensuring both the safety of the workers and the drivers.
