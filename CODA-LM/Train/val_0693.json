Further up the road, several vehicles are stopped at a red traffic light, indicating that the ego car must maintain a safe following distance to allow for stopping. On the right side of the road, there is a sign indicating a pedestrian crossing ahead, along with a '20' speed limit sign, alerting drivers to watch for pedestrians and adhere to the lower speed limit. The traffic light for the ego car's lane is red, requiring the vehicle to come to a complete stop. Barriers are also present on the right side of the road, signaling road work or a lane closure, which may necessitate a lane change for the ego car. Additionally, a temporary road sign warns of road work ahead, indicating that the ego car may need to change lanes or reduce speed to navigate the upcoming road conditions safely. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."

Keep an eye out for potential diversions or lane adjustments if the barriers indicate a closed lane or road work. No lane change is advised at the moment due to the blocked right lane indicated by the sign and barriers."
