It is a small motorized vehicle equipped for individual use, typically featuring two wheels and a lower-powered engine than most motorcycles. Mopeds are used for transportation over short distances and are popular in urban settings due to their agility and fuel efficiency. In the context of the image, the moped influences the driving behavior by requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be alert for any sudden changes in its movement, such as stopping or turning maneuvers. It is crucial for the ego car to monitor the mopeds position to avoid collisions and ensure safe passage through congested areas.",

In this driving scenario, the stationary moped slightly narrows the usable space on the road for other vehicles. The ego car must ensure that it maintains a safe distance as it passes by to avoid any contact with the moped while also being aware of any potential movements from the moped, in case the owner decides to start and move into traffic.",
