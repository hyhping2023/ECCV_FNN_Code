This motorcycle is not entirely on the shoulder but extends partially onto the main carriageway. The positioning of the motorcycle could lead to potential hazards. This is because there's a possibility that the rider might decide to maneuver the motorcycle suddenly, or its placement could narrow the usable width of the carriageway for the ego vehicle, affecting its driving behavior.\n\nSecond, on the left side of the road, red and white roadside barriers are present. These barriers serve as an indication that either a section of the road or an area beside the road may be off-limits to vehicles. The presence of these barriers is significant for the ego car. It must take them into account to maintain a safe distance and avoid any accidental contact with them.\n\nIt's important to note that the image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects that could impact the autonomous driving system's behavior outside of the described motorcycle and barriers."
