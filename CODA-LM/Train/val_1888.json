A white van is on the immediate left, moving parallel to the ego car, requiring caution in case the van changes lanes. There's also a beige minibus ahead in the left lane, prompting the ego car to monitor this vehicle closely due to its potential for unpredictable movements.\n\nAn overhead gantry displays arrow signs signaling lane directions and exists, meaning the ego car must plan lane changes early to follow the desired route. While no traffic lights are visible in the scene, several traffic cones are lined up on the right, indicating possible road work and advising the ego car to stay clear of that lane. Metal barriers are present along the right side of the road, enforcing lane discipline and caution due to reduced road width.\n\nThe image also captures reflections and streaks on the windscreen of the ego vehicle, indicating either rain or a dirty surface, which suggests the need for using wipers and adjusting driving speed for safety in potentially lower visibility conditions. There are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians or cyclists, to be noted in this scenario."

It serves as a device used in road management to guide vehicles and maintain safe driving lanes. Although flattened, this traffic cone still indicates a point of caution or a spatial boundary that drivers should be aware of.

Its presence indicates a zone where vehicular access is either restricted or controlled, thus influencing the ego car to maintain caution, reduce speed, and possibly adhere to altered traffic patterns. This setup assists in preventing accidents and ensuring the smooth flow of traffic around temporary hazards or construction sites.",

Refrain from any sudden movements and continue to monitor the behavior of surrounding vehicles. Keep the windshield clear for optimal visibility and adjust speed according to the road conditions."
