The first is a silver car positioned ahead of the ego vehicle, parked on the side of the road and clearly identifiable by its activated rear lights. This parked car is significant because it may block the path or restrict the available space for the ego vehicle to maneuver, necessitating extra caution when attempting to overtake.\n\nThe second vehicle is noted to have its rear lights visible and is located behind the parked silver car. The presence of this car, with its rear lights on, suggests that it might be stationary or moving slowly, indicating the possibility of upcoming congestion or an obstruction on the road that the ego vehicle should be prepared to navigate around. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving conditions for the ego vehicle."
