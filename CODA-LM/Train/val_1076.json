A yellow crane truck parked on the side of the road on the right, perpendicular to the ego vehicle's direction of travel, occupying part of the road. This truck may obstruct the lane and reduce the available space for the ego car to maneuver.\n  2. A white sedan parked in the distance on the right side of the road, immediately before a slight right bend. While it does not pose an immediate risk, the ego car should be aware of its presence for any unexpected movements.\n\n- **Other objects**:\n  - Debris scattered on the right side of the road, including bricks, rubble, and construction material. These objects are hazards that the ego car needs to avoid to prevent damage to the vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a mobile crane mounted on a yellow truck, positioned on the side of the road. The crane's long arm, which is extendable, is partially extended and positioned high above the truck. This machinery is typically used for lifting heavy materials during construction or maintenance activities. In terms of driving behavior, the presence of this large construction vehicle suggests potential temporary road obstructions or diversions. The ego car should maintain vigilance and possibly adjust speed or position on the road to safely navigate past the area, taking into account the extended crane arm which could reduce available driving space or pose overhead hazards.",
