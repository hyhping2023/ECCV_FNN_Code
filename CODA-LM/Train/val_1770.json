        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a few notable road users and objects. A partially visible truck is situated on the left side, potentially parked or stopped, which obstructs the view to that side. This means that drivers need to be cautious when passing, as pedestrians or other vehicles might be hidden behind it. On the right side of the road, a red car is visible in the distance and appears to be parked. This indicates that the area could be populated, warranting extra vigilance for unexpected pedestrians and the possibility of car doors opening into the roadway. Also, there is a yellow car on the right side of the image, moving away from the ego car and not affecting the ego car's driving decisions as it's in a different lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image. \n\nHowever, there is an object worth mentioning â€“ a semicircular artifact at the bottom of the image, possibly due to reflection or glare from the sunlight on the windshield, which can impair vision. Autonomous driving systems should be adept at filtering out or compensating for such visual impairments to maintain safe operation."
