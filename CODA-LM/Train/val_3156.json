The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to the white car's movements, as it could potentially change lanes or slow down.\n\nAdditionally, there is a truck on the right side of the image, parked with an orange cargo container, positioned perpendicular to the road, and appears to be stationary. While the truck is not actively influencing traffic, it serves as a visual obstruction. The ego car should be cautious of this while maneuvering in its vicinity.\n\nA motorcyclist is also present in the center of the image, positioned diagonally to the left of the ego car, and appears to be moving forward. Due to the less stability and visibility of motorcycles compared to cars, the ego car must be vigilant to ensure a safe distance and be aware of the motorcyclist's movements.\n\nBright orange traffic cones are lined up on the right side of the image, leading towards the parked truck, indicating a construction zone or closed-off area. These cones suggest that there may be a lane closure or obstacle ahead, and the ego car should be prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary.\n\nLastly, there is a blue dustbin on the sidewalk to the right side of the image, which appears to be stationary. The dustbin itself does not directly influence the driving behavior, but it indicates that the ego car should avoid driving too close to the sidewalk to prevent potential collisions with stationary objects or pedestrians that may emerge."

In the driving scenario of the ego car, this cone suggests there might be roadwork ahead, an obstruction, or a change in the usual traffic pattern.
