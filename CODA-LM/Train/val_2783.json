        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are two vans, one white and one light blue, parked on the side of the road. The stationary position of these vehicles could obstruct part of the ego vehicle's path or field of view, which requires the driver to exercise increased caution. Additionally, yellow traffic cones are placed on the side of the road, indicating a temporary construction or work zone. This suggests that there may be lane closures or obstacles ahead, and the ego vehicle should navigate the area carefully. Furthermore, there are piles of debris or construction materials also present on the side of the road. These could pose a hazard if they were to spill onto the driving path, so the ego vehicle must maintain increased awareness and preparedness to respond to any potential hazards. Other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and barriers are not present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a barrier used for road management. It appears to be positioned temporarily, possibly to segregate traffic lanes or to section off a part of the road for construction work or another specific use. The presence of this barrier influences driving behavior as drivers must maneuver around it, reducing lane width and potentially lowering travel speed to navigate safely past the barrier. Proper care should be taken to observe any signage or additional signals associated with this barrier to ensure correct and safe driving near it.",
