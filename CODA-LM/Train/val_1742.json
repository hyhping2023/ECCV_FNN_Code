Specifically, there are two vehicles ahead; one is partially visible on the left and appears to be parked, while the other on the right has its rear lights activated, signaling that it is either braking or stationary. These vehicles may influence the driving path of the ego car by reducing the available space on the road and might potentially move, posing a consideration for navigation. Additionally, orange traffic cones are placed in a line in front of the ego vehicle, indicating a possible roadblock or a redirection of traffic flow. This arrangement suggests there might be construction work underway or an event leading to a change in the usual traffic pattern. Consequently, the ego car must adjust its path to accommodate these changes safely."

It requires the driver of the ego vehicle to reduce speed and possibly stop to either wait for clearance or to perform any required checks before proceeding.
