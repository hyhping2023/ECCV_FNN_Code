A large construction truck, specifically identified as a cement mixer with its drum rotating, is situated directly in front of the ego vehicle, within the same lane. Its considerable size and elevated position compared to regular vehicles severely limit the visibility of the road ahead for the ego vehicle. Additionally, a white utility van is noticed in an adjacent lane to the left, signaling a moderate traffic density and suggesting the possibility of vehicles changing lanes.\n\nMoreover, there is a traffic light positioned beyond the construction truck, currently displaying a green light. This green light signifies that the vehicles in the lane of the ego vehicle are permitted to proceed. However, caution is advised due to the construction truckâ€™s potential for unpredictable movement or its capacity to obstruct the view of the traffic light.\n\nThe image contains no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, nor are there any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would otherwise influence driving behavior or conditions."

Prepare for possible stops or reduced speed of the truck without trying to overtake immediately, as visibility is compromised. Stay alert for any construction signs or signals indicating a work zone ahead that may require a reduction in speed or change of lanes. Monitor adjacent lanes for traffic that may affect the ability to change lanes if necessary. Continue to obey the green traffic light while exercising caution due to limited visibility and potential construction activity."
