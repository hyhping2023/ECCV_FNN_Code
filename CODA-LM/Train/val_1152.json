In a traffic environment, cyclists can affect the movement and decision-making of other road users. The presence of a cyclist necessitates cautious driving from the ego car, especially in urban traffic conditions. The driver should maintain a safe distance and speed, being prepared for possible sudden movements by the cyclist. It is crucial to check for sufficient space before overtaking or changing lanes to ensure the safety of the cyclist.",
