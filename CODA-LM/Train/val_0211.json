These signs signal that certain vehicle types are prohibited from entering specific areas, suggesting upcoming traffic regulations that could impact possible routes.\n\nRed and white reflective traffic posts are present along the left side of the road, marking a boundary or restricted area. These barriers indicate that the ego car should stay on the right side of the road and avoid crossing into the restricted zone.\n\nAdditionally, there is a digital signboard on the right side of the road, which may display changing information. The ego car should be prepared to read and act on any dynamic instructions or updates displayed on this signboard."
