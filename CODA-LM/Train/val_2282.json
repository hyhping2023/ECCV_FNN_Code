This suggests that there might be loading or unloading activity occurring, which could lead to people entering the roadway or the van moving unexpectedly. Additionally, there are pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right, with one particularly close to the parked van. These pedestrians pose a potential risk as they could step onto the road without notice. Furthermore, a series of blue traffic cones are arranged in a line on the right side of the road leading up to the parked van. The positioning of these cones suggests they are demarcating a temporary pathway or highlighting a no-go area, likely in response to the activity around the van."
