Firstly, a large construction truck is seen carrying a load of concrete or debris, which may cause an obstruction or act as a slow-moving vehicle. Due to this, the ego car needs to be cautious, potentially slowing down or changing lanes to navigate safely around the truck.\n\nAhead of the construction truck, there is a sedan car. To ensure road safety, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance from the sedan, staying alert to any sudden stops or lane changes the sedan may make.\n\nOn the side of the road, there's a traffic sign displaying a 20 km/h speed limit. The ego car needs to adhere to this speed restriction to comply with traffic laws and drive safely within this zone.\n\nFinally, metal barriers or fences are installed along the side of the road. These barriers delineate the drivable area for the ego car and separate the road from adjacent spaces.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects in the image that influence the driving behavior of the ego car."

The truck's rear placement poses a potential constraint on the visibility for drivers behind it, making it crucial for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance.
