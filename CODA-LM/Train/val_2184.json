Ahead on the roadway, several vehicles are traveling in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles are part of the traffic flow, and their speed and movements will directly affect the driving decisions of the ego car.\n\nTo the right side of the ego car's lane, there is a series of traffic cones marking the boundary of a construction zone. These traffic cones indicate a reduced lane width and potential hazards due to ongoing construction. The ego car should be prepared to slow down and maneuver cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the cones to avoid any contact.\n\nAdditionally, solid barriers are present on the right, separating the road from the construction zone. These barriers signify that there is no access to the area beyond the road, and the ego car must stay within the confines of the demarcated lane.\n\nVisible beyond these barriers are construction equipment and materials located outside of the immediate driving lane. While not directly in the path of the ego car, these objects could indicate the presence of workers nearby or the potential for unexpected obstructions, requiring the driver to remain attentive."
