        "description and explanation": "In the provided traffic image, various road users and signs are observed which play a key role in dictating the behavior of the autonomous driving system of the ego car. Firstly, oncoming vehicles include a white car positioned in the left-most lane, either going straight or planning a left turn at the intersection. Additionally, a silver car is in the process of making a left turn at the center of the intersection. The movements of these vehicles are crucial for the ego car to consider in order to navigate the intersection safely, taking into account traffic light status and right-of-way rules.\n\nParked along the right side of the road, past the crosswalk, are several cars. The positioning of these parked cars is significant as they could obstruct the view of emerging pedestrians or other road users, thus requiring the ego car to exercise additional caution in these areas.\n\nThe presence of traffic signs includes a \"No Entry\" sign for the lane to the right, prohibiting vehicles coming from this direction to enter, and a blue arrow sign indicating that proceeding straight or making a left turn are the available options. This directional guidance necessitates the ego car to avoid turning right, adhering instead to the permitted directions.\n\nOverhead, two traffic lights at the intersection are visible, displaying green lights which signal that vehicles in the ego car's direction are allowed to move forward. This green light condition necessitates the ego car to proceed with caution, respecting the movements of other road users while adhering to right-of-way rules.\n\nLastly, construction barriers placed on the left side of the road delineate an ongoing construction zone. This alerts the ego car to the necessity of reduced speeds and heightened awareness to safely navigate past the construction activity.\n\nIn this traffic scenario, the described elements collectively inform the autonomous driving system's decision-making processes, ensuring safe and rule-compliant navigation through the urban environment."
