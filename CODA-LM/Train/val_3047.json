This van may obstruct the ego car's field of view and complicate interactions with other road users. Additionally, several vehicles are parked along the side of the road on the right, parallel to the ego car's direction. These parked vehicles are not immediately affecting the ego car's path but should be noted in case one pulls out.\n\nTwo pedestrians are present. One pedestrian, wearing a red top and dark pants, is walking a dog and moving from right to left across the crosswalk in front of the ego car. This pedestrian directly affects the ego car's ability to proceed, requiring it to wait until the crosswalk is clear. The second pedestrian, wearing a yellow vest, is crossing in the same direction but is behind the leading pedestrian. The ego car must also wait until this pedestrian clears the crosswalk completely before proceeding.\n\nA directional sign located to the right of the ego car on a traffic island indicates a mandatory direction with an arrow pointing left. This sign instructs that traffic must proceed in a direction that rotates around the traffic island, thereby changing the flow of traffic. Moreover, a traffic light directly in the ego car's line of sight is showing red, necessitating the ego car to stop and wait for the light to turn green before moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic barrier on a small traffic island to the right, indicating a separation of lanes and directing the flow of traffic. This barrier designates lane paths and prohibits the ego car from driving straight through or turning right at this intersection."

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the parked vehicles on the side of the road for any movement as they could indicate a potential hazard if one decides to enter traffic. Lastly, the ego car should prepare to comply with the directional traffic sign and follow the mandatory direction around the traffic island."
