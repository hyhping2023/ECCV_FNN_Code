        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects to note. Firstly, a white van is traveling in the opposite direction in the oncoming left lane, which doesn't immediately affect the ego vehicle's behavior, assuming it remains in its lane. Additionally, there are multiple parked or slow-moving vehicles on the right side of the road, in the far-right lane. These vehicles could potentially enter the ego vehicle's lane unexpectedly and thus represent a possible hazard to be prepared for.\n\nThere are also vulnerable road users to be cautious of. A cyclist is present ahead on the right-hand side of the road, next to the parked vehicles. The cyclist could potentially swerve to avoid obstacles like opening car doors, making them a potential hazard that the ego vehicle should monitor carefully. Furthermore, a small animal, which might be a dog, is observed crossing the road just ahead of the ego vehicle, posing an immediate and unpredictable hazard. The ego car needs to be ready to slow down or stop to prevent an accident.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, suggesting that these elements are not present or not relevant in this scenario."
