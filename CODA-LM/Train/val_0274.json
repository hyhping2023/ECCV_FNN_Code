Among the vehicles, there is a red truck loaded with goods heading away from the ego car in the leftmost lane. The truck's size and potential speed necessitate maintaining a safe following distance. Additionally, a white bus occupies the next lane to the ego car's right, moving in the same direction. The bus could encounter unexpected stops, so it requires monitoring for any such events. Another dark-colored bus is partially visible in the far right lane, also moving in the same direction as the ego car, and caution should be exercised due to possible pedestrian activity around it.\n\nThe traffic signs in view include directional signs above the road that provide guidance on lane directions and available exits, thereby informing the ego car's lane choices to follow its intended route. Also visible is a 'no left turn' sign at an intersection ahead, prohibiting left turns and hence, directing the driving path.\n\nThere is a traffic light situated directly ahead in a green phase, indicating that the ego car is clear to proceed through the intersection without stopping.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are lined up beside the road barrier, denoting the boundary of a construction zone. These cones serve to guide the ego car away from this off-limit area and potential hazards therein.\n\nIn terms of barriers, there is a temporary construction barrier on the right side of the road ahead, signaling the presence of road work or a lane closure, which the ego car must navigate around to avoid disturbances.\n\nAnother aspect of the scene includes a building structure on the left and a green fence barrier on the right. While these do not have an immediate impact on driving decisions, they signify the nature of the surrounding environment, which appears to be urban or commercial.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists, mentioned in the scene."
