The car should also be ready to switch lanes safely to the left if the lane ahead is blocked by the barriers and traffic cones. It is essential to monitor the stationary vehicles ahead closely for any indication of movement that could affect the ego car's path. Headlights should be appropriately adjusted for night driving without causing glare to other drivers and to ensure adequate visibility of the road ahead."
