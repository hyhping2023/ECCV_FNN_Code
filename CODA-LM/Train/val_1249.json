The presence of the forklift suggests it could be involved in construction or moving items, potentially causing sudden movements or stops that could impact traffic flow. There is a green traffic light visible ahead, indicating that vehicles, including the ego car, are permitted to proceed, but it is important to stay alert to the forklift's movements. Additionally, on the right side of the road, there are green fencing barriers signifying a construction or restricted area along the sidewalk. These barriers guide traffic away from the construction zone, possibly narrowing the available road space, which requires careful navigation by the ego vehicle."

It is currently positioned near or on the roadway, which indicates that nearby construction or roadwork might be ongoing. This situation might influence the ego car's driving behavior by necessitating a reduction in speed and an increase in caution. The vehicle's presence might also lead to potential obstacles or changes in traffic patterns, such as lane closures or diversions, requiring the ego car driver to stay alert and possibly follow alternative directions.",
