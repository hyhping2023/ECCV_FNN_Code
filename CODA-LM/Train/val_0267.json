The presence of the black van requires the ego car to ensure there is enough clearance while driving past it. Additionally, a white SUV is parked on the left side of the road, near the curb, demanding that the ego car maintains a central lane position to prevent sideswiping. Furthermore, a silver sedan is approaching from the opposite direction in the center of the road, affecting the ego car's lane position and speed due to the necessary caution to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian standing on the sidewalk to the left, near a parked scooter, which calls for the ego car's cautious behavior in case they step onto the road. Moreover, a cyclist is riding on the road ahead, in the same direction as the ego car, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential sudden movements.\n\nA traffic sign observed in the scene is a pedestrian crossing sign located ahead on the right side of the road. This sign indicates the possibility of pedestrians crossing, requiring the ego car to be prepared to stop if needed.\n\nOther objects noted in the scene include a few scooters parked on the sidewalk to the left. These parked scooters could indicate the presence of their riders nearby, suggesting that the ego car should be cautious of pedestrians potentially stepping onto the road.\n\nThe traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers categories do not contain any entries for this specific traffic image, implying their absence or irrelevance in this observed scene."
