        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several notable elements affecting the road conditions. Firstly, a white car is positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, and its brake lights are on, indicating that it is slowing down or coming to a stop. The presence of this vehicle is significant as it necessitates the ego vehicle to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue rectangular traffic sign with a white 'P' on it to the right side of the road. This parking sign indicates the availability of parking spots nearby. It serves as a warning that vehicles in the vicinity may decelerate or stop to park, which means the ego vehicle must be prepared for such movements from other road users.\n\nFurthermore, an orange and white traffic cone can be seen on the right side of the road, next to the ego vehicle. This cone may signal road work or the presence of a hazard on the right. As a result, the traffic lane may be narrower than usual, and drivers are expected to slow down and exercise caution when driving past this point.\n\nNo other road users or obstacles, such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects, are present in this scene."
