The sedan's presence and behavior will directly influence the ego car's speed and following distance.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n    - A cyclist is on the right-hand side of the road, moving in the same direction as the traffic. The cyclist's proximity to the driving lane necessitates the ego car to maintain a safe passing distance due to potential maneuvers avoiding obstacles or changes in direction.\n    - Pedestrians are visible further down the road on the sidewalk to the right, moving in the same direction as the ego car. Even though they are not on the road, their proximity suggests the ego car should remain alert to any potential unexpected entry into the roadway.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs:**\n    - A blue circular sign with a white arrow pointing downward indicates that the lane ahead is open for the ego car to proceed. This sign informs that the ego car is in the correct lane to continue.\n    - A no stopping or parking sign on the right side of the road indicates that stopping or parking in the immediate vicinity is prohibited, reducing the likelihood of encountering stationary vehicles on the side of the road.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones:**\n    - Traffic cones and a barrier are placed on the road edge near a pedestrian crossing, indicating roadwork or an obstruction on the side of the road. These objects suggest a narrowed lane, requiring the ego car to navigate carefully to avoid the cones and barrier.\n\n5. **Barriers:**\n    - A barrier combined with traffic cones is on the road edge near the pedestrian crossing. The presence of the barrier may indicate road work or a closed-off area that the ego car needs to be cautious around.\n\n6. **Other Objects:**\n    - A dustbin is located on the right side of the road, near the pedestrian crossing and next to a bench. While the dustbin itself poses no immediate threat, its proximity to the crossing means the ego car should watch for pedestrians who may be obscured by it or other street furniture.\n\nThis detailed analysis helps in understanding the driving environment and ensuring the ego car operates safely."
