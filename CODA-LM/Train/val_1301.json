It is not obstructing the path of the ego vehicle but its presence indicates that there might be nearby work activity, which could potentially affect road conditions. The forklift may enter the roadway unexpectedly or create other traffic disruptions while in operation.\n\nAdditionally, on the right side of the road, there is a stop sign, which is accompanied by a blue circular sign that mandates a right turn at the intersection. This signifies that the ego vehicle is required to stop completely at the sign before continuing and is obligated to take the road to the right as instructed by the sign."
