It is occupying the right lane ahead of the ego car. The presence of this construction vehicle may potentially slow down traffic or cause unexpected stops due to its size and the nature of its transport. As a result, the ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust its speed accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers lining the left side of the road, which serve to separate the road from the pedestrian walkway. These barriers ensure that there is no possibility of pedestrians or other road users unexpectedly entering the road from the left. This allows the ego car to focus on potential hazards that may arise from the right side of the road."

It is featured prominently in the driving scenario and appears to be either in transit to a construction site or delivering equipment. The presence of this type of large and heavy vehicle influences the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring increased caution and possibly reduced speed. Due to the size and the potential for sudden movements or stops, maintaining a larger following distance than usual is advisable to ensure safety.",
