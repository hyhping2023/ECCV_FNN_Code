Its rotating drum indicates it is used for transporting concrete. The truck's large size and slower movement make it a critical road user, dictating the pace of the ego car and potentially obscuring the view ahead.\n    - A white delivery-style truck is partially visible in the adjacent lane ahead to the right. Its position could influence lane change opportunities and traffic flow around the ego car.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n    - Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right. While they are not in a position to affect the ego car's immediate driving decisions, their presence requires monitoring in case any individual steps onto the roadway.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n    - A red traffic light, attached to the back of the concrete mixer truck and facing the opposite direction of travel, likely controls traffic in a construction zone or similar scenario. This light could be confusing for the ego car but signals the need to be alert for potential construction or traffic control ahead."
