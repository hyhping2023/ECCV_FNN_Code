First, there is a light blue truck on the left side, positioned diagonally and facing the opposite direction, which suggests it may be parked or preparing to turn. This truck could affect the available space for the ego car to maneuver. On the road's right side, there's a three-wheeled vehicle parked and facing the same direction as the ego car, reducing the drivable road width and possibly opening a door or moving suddenly.\n\nAdditionally, there's a pedestrian walking along the road with their back towards us on the left side, posing a risk if they were to move into the road, thus requiring the ego car's caution. Accompanying the pedestrian is a small dog, closer to the road's middle, which may enter the ego car's lane and cause a hazard.\n\nLastly, there are trash bins on the right side, close to the three-wheeled vehicle, obstructing the sidewalk partially. These could limit visibility and necessitate the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the road edge. No traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this scene."
