        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there's a dark-colored SUV driving ahead of the ego car, positioned in the center of the rightmost lane. This SUV has its brake lights activated, signaling that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This situation requires the ego car to closely monitor the SUVâ€™s behavior as it dictates the immediate flow of traffic. Any sudden stops or turns by the SUV will necessitate a prompt reaction from the ego car to maintain safety.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are a few notable ones. Firstly, a blue parking sign visible to the right of the road close to the ego car indicates a parking area ahead. This suggests that vehicles may be slowing down or pulling into the parking area, thus the ego car must be vigilant for such maneuvers. Secondly, a speed limit sign posted to the right side of the road ahead of the ego car displays a maximum allowed speed of 30 km/h, which the ego car must adhere to in order to comply with traffic regulations. Additionally, a supplementary sign below the speed limit indicates a distance of 50m ahead, likely marking the start of the speed limit zone or signifying another point of reference such as speed enforcement cameras. The ego car should, therefore, be prepared to adjust its speed or be aware of changes within the upcoming 50m.\n\nThe scene also features road barriers positioned along the median, separating the two directions of traffic. These barriers aim to guide the flow of traffic and prevent any vehicles from crossing into the opposite lanes. It is important for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from these barriers to ensure safety.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other objects are not present in this specific traffic image, indicating a scene primarily dominated by vehicles, traffic signs, and barriers."

Exercise caution due to wet road conditions, reducing speed to prevent hydroplaning and to compensate for increased stopping distances."
