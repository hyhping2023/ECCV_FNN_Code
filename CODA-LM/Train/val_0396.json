The presence of these vehicles reduces the width of the drivable lane, requiring the ego car to maintain its position more towards the center of the road to navigate safely. On the road, there is a pedestrian crossing directly in front of the ego car from right to left, necessitating the vehicle to either stop or slow down to ensure the pedestrian's safety. Additionally, there is a person pushing a stroller across the crosswalk to the left of the ego car. This individual and the stroller also represent a potential obstruction to the ego car's path, posing a similar need for the vehicle to yield to ensure safe passage.\n\nTraffic lights are installed above the intersection; however, the signal status is unspecified. Because of this, the ego car will have to observe the current status of the traffic lights to comply with the traffic signals once they are visible and to maintain safety at the intersection.\n\nFurthermore, there are orange and white traffic cones strategically placed along the edge of the walkway on the left side of the street. These cones are likely there to indicate a boundary for either ongoing work or to prevent access, signaling to vehicles the need to keep away from that particular area to avoid potential hazards or interference with designated activities."

The ego car should not attempt to pass the parked vehicles closely due to the reduced lane width and the proximity of the pedestrian crossing. Safety is the priority, so all movements should be made once the pedestrians are clear, and it is legal to proceed."
