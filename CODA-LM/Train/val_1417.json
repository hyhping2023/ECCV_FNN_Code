Additionally, a yellow heavy-duty truck is situated on the right of the image, moving away from the ego car. Despite moving away, its size and position may influence traffic dynamics and necessitate attention.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity, so no action is required from the ego vehicle regarding these users. A traffic light is not visible in the image, thus the ego car should approach intersections with caution and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the ego car's lane, creating a minor obstruction and indicating possible hazards or road work ahead that might require a lane change or reduced speed. There is also a dustbin and a barrier next to the traffic cones on the left side of the road, suggesting the likelihood of road work or a closed section of the lane, which might require additional attention or a lane change."
