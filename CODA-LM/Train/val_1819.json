This vehicle's size and close proximity to the travel lane may obstruct visibility or part of it might encroach onto the road, posing a potential risk. Additionally, a motorcyclist is present at the center of the intersection, moving perpendicular to the ego car's direction.

Given its presence, it indicates potential construction activity in the area. This might lead to possible delays, diversion routes, or temporary traffic congestion in the vicinity. Such a scenario requires the ego car to reduce speed and increase alertness for sudden changes in traffic flow or unexpected pedestrians or workers crossing the road. Additionally, this could involve navigating around any roadwork signs or barriers that may be present due to the construction activity.",
