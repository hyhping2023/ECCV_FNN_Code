This vehicle is significant as it may slow down, stop, or change lanes, which would require the ego car to adjust its speed and distance to maintain safety. Additionally, there are several parked cars on both sides of the road, occupying the parking lanes. These vehicles narrow the usable road space and could be sources of moving pedestrians or might unexpectedly enter the traffic flow.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the left, moving parallel to the road. The proximity of the pedestrian to the road means the ego car must be vigilant and ready to react if the pedestrian steps onto the road.\n\nA traffic sign is present on the left sidewalk, indicating a no parking zone. This sign informs the ego car that it is not allowed to stop at the curb on the left side of the road, ensuring that the car continues to move without considering pulling over in this area.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light ahead is displaying a green signal, allowing the ego car to continue on its path. The green light gives the ego car the right of way, enabling it to maintain its speed and proceed through the intersection, provided that it is safe to do so.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
