The truck might be stationary or moving slowly, indicating possible maintenance or construction work, which could temporarily obstruct the road. A road worker is present at the rear side of the truck, dressed in high-visibility clothing for safety, signifying potential roadwork. This necessitates that the ego car slows down and proceeds cautiously to ensure the worker's safety.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road leading up to the truck and road worker. These cones signal a change in traffic patterns and indicate that part of the road might be closed or that caution is required when navigating. A barrier is also visible on the right, separating the main road from an area under construction or maintenance, intended to protect road users from any hazards related to the work area and to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nOn the left side, there is a blank billboard that does not display any navigation or road condition information. While the billboard is unlikely to affect driving behavior, it is part of the roadside environment and should be noted."
