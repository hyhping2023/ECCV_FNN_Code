This red and brown container truck's rear is visible to the ego car under limited nighttime lighting conditions.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large truck characterized by a containerized back used for transporting goods. The cargo area is enclosed on all sides to secure and protect the contents during transit. For the ego car, the presence of this truck influences driving behavior by necessitating increased following distance due to the truck's larger size and potentially slower acceleration or deceleration rates. It also requires careful monitoring of the truck's turn signals and brake lights to anticipate its maneuvers, as the truck can obstruct the view ahead, making it essential to be prepared for sudden stops or turns.",

Use the vehicle's headlights and any available technology, such as night vision systems if equipped, to enhance visibility. Be prepared to adjust speed accordingly if the truck slows down or signals to make a turn, and only attempt to overtake when it is safe to do so, and with clear visibility of the adjacent lane."
