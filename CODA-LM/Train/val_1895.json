Starting with vehicles, there are cars parked on both sides of the street, some with their hazard lights on, which signals that the driving lane's available width is reduced and there might be obscured pedestrians or hazards. Additionally, a white van is parked improperly on the right side, encroaching into the driving lane, which presents a risk as it may start moving abruptly or a door may be opened into the lane.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian in the distance on the right side, walking away from the ego vehicle. This individual requires attention as pedestrians could make unexpected moves and may enter the road without warning. Furthermore, two dogs can be seen crossing the road directly in front of the ego car that represent a direct hazard; they might cause the vehicle to engage in sudden braking or evasion maneuvers.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects have been reported in the image as all the respective categories were empty in the JSON data provided."
