The presence of this parked car reduces the usable width of the road for the ego vehicle and may lead to unexpected behavior, such as the possibility of doors opening or passengers disembarking, which the ego vehicle needs to be cautious of.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is present in the center of the image, occupying the same lane as the ego vehicle but facing away, indicating that they are moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Due to the cyclist's position and potential vulnerability, the ego vehicle is required to slow down and may need to change lanes to overtake the cyclist safely, ensuring enough clearance.\n\nFurthermore, there is a digital display traffic sign on the right-hand side of the road. Unfortunately, the contents of the sign are not clear due to the image quality. Despite the lack of legible information, the sign's presence suggests that it may contain important navigational or regulatory information, and thus the ego vehicle should remain alert to any updates or changes that could be displayed on this sign.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
