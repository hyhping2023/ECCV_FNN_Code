Additionally, an orange traffic cone near the left side of the intersection suggests a potential hazard or boundary that the ego car should avoid.\n\nLastly, a small dog is crossing the road at the crosswalk, requiring the ego car to exercise caution and be prepared to stop if the dog remains in the roadway."
