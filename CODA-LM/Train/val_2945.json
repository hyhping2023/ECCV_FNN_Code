Caution is advised given the truck's potential for unexpected movements. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the same road, coming towards the front. As a vulnerable road user, the presence of the cyclist necessitates vigilance since they may be difficult to spot and are at a higher risk in the event of a collision. Their behavior could also be unpredictable. Moreover, there is a billboard or advertisement sign along the side of the road. Although not a traffic sign, it's important to be aware that the billboard might block some parts of the road from view or serve as a distraction to drivers. It is noted that there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image according to the data provided."

Its presence on the road is significant as it suggests nearby construction work, possibly leading to road restrictions or altered traffic patterns. Drivers, including the ego vehicle, should approach with caution, be prepared for sudden stops, and observe any temporary traffic signs or signals related to the construction activity.",
