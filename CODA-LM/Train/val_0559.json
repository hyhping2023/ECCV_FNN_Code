Although it is not an immediate obstacle, extra caution is warranted in case someone enters or exits the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a group of pedestrians standing on the right roadside, appearing to be waiting, perhaps for a bus, near a bus stop sign. Their proximity to the road suggests a potential for them to enter the roadway, which means the ego vehicle should monitor them carefully.\n\nAs for traffic signs, a no-parking sign is visible on the right side of the road just ahead, indicating that stopping or parking in this area is not allowed, a fact that should be kept in mind if there's a need for the ego car to pull over. Moreover, a bus stop sign can be seen adjacent to the location of the pedestrians, signaling the presence of a bus stop where buses might halt, and possible pedestrian activity as they may cross the road to board the bus.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this scene."

Placed strategically on the edge of the roadway, its purpose is to prevent vehicles from parking or driving through certain protected areas such as sidewalks or pedestrian zones.
