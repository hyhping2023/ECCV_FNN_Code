It is walking away from our point of view but has its gaze turned towards us. The presence of this dog introduces a potential hazard as it may unexpectedly enter the roadway. Secondly, the scene includes various objects and infrastructures such as a bus stop shelter and fences along the side of the road. While these objects do not currently pose a direct risk to driving behavior, they necessitate vigilant observation. The need for caution stems from the possibility of changes in the environment or the emergence of hidden road users from behind these objects. Other common categories like vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers do not have representatives in this particular image and, therefore, do not impact the current analysis of road conditions."
