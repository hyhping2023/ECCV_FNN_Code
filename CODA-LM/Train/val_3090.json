The truck is occupying the lane in front of the ego car, necessitating the maintenance of a safe following distance by the ego car as it directly impacts the car's ability to move forward. Additionally, there is a traffic light ahead displaying a green light, signaling that the ego car is permitted to proceed. However, caution is advised due to the presence of the truck ahead. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the scene."

It is typically mounted on a traffic signal pole and contains lights in three colors: red, yellow, and green. This light is used to control traffic at intersections by signaling when vehicles and pedestrians can go or stop. The green light indicates that it is safe for vehicles approaching the light in its direction to proceed through the intersection or turn, as allowed. In this driving scenario, the green light influences the ego car to continue its movement through the intersection without stopping.",
