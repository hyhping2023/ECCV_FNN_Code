Although currently stationary, the car's doors might open or it could pull out into traffic, potentially impacting the ego vehicleâ€™s path.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:**\n   - Pedestrians are seen on the right side, walking parallel to the road and possibly preparing to cross. Their closeness to the roadway could necessitate the ego vehicle to be ready to stop or slow down to ensure their safety.\n   - A cyclist is visible at the far right edge of the image, riding in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's proximity to the driving lane requires the ego car to keep a safe distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs:**\n   - A green street name sign is located at the top left, with various storefront signs along the road. While these signs do not directly impact traffic, the street name sign provides locational awareness. The storefront signs do not affect driving behavior, but being aware of them is part of understanding the surroundings.\n\n4. **Other Objects:**\n   - On the right sidewalk, there are umbrellas and a dustbin. Although these items are not on the road, they indicate high pedestrian activity and street commerce, which could lead to unpredictable pedestrian movements.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."
