        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, the ego car is encountering several road users and objects. There is a large yellow construction vehicle directly ahead in the ego car's lane, its brake lights are on, suggesting that it is either slowing down or has stopped. Due to the vehicle's considerable size and its potential state of operation, the ego car is required to either reduce speed or change lanes to ensure a safe passage.\n\nTo the ego car's left and slightly ahead, there is a black sedan in the neighboring lane. The ego car needs to be aware of the sedan's proximity and its advance relative to the ego car, as it might indicate an intention to merge into the ego car's lane. As a precaution, the ego car should be prepared to adjust its speed or lane position to accommodate the sedan's possible movement.\n\nOn the road's right edge, the ego car will observe multiple traffic cones that delineate the boundary of the driving area, signaling that the adjacent area is off-limits for traffic. The placement of the traffic cones indicates to the ego car to stay within its current lane and maintain a safe distance from the roadside.\n\nIn addition to the more immediate and recognizable obstacles, there are some unidentifiable objects or debris located beyond the traffic cones on the side of the road. While these objects do not directly obstruct the pathway of the ego car, it is essential to acknowledge their presence to preclude any safety risks as a result of proximity to potential hazards."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, typically used in engineering and building tasks. It is a heavy-duty vehicle equipped with various machinery for construction purposes, notable here by the presence of a crane-like structure on its back. Such vehicles often move slower than average road traffic due to their size and the weight of the equipment they carry. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road necessitates increased caution and potentially slower speeds from the ego car, as well as possibly greater stopping distances. Awareness of sudden stops is crucial since these vehicles can unpredictably begin operations at any time or reduce speed to navigate road construction sites or uneven road surfaces.",

Additionally, the driver or autonomous system should keep to the left of the cones, maintaining a safe distance from potential hazards on the side of the road."
