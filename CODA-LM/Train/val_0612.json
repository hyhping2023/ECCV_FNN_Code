There are multiple pedestrians on both sides of the street, some of whom may be preparing to cross or are close to the travel lane edge, posing a risk of unexpected road entry and requiring the ego car to be ready to stop or slow down. Additionally, several cyclists and motorcyclists are sharing the travel lane with the ego car and mingling with automotive traffic, necessitating a safe distance due to their vulnerability and potential for unpredictable movements.
