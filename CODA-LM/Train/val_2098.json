Vehicles:\n   - A white scooter is parked on the side of the road by a shopfront, potentially with a person standing or moving beside it. Although the scooter is stationary and does not pose an immediate dynamic hazard, the presence of a person near it suggests caution is required in case they decide to move onto the road.\n   - Various vehicles are visible in the distance with illuminated tail lights, indicating traffic presence ahead. The ego car should monitor these vehicles for any changes in speed and be prepared to stop if the traffic flow is interrupted.\n\n2. Vulnerable Road Users:\n   - There is a person who appears to be standing or moving near the parked scooter by the shopfront. This individual represents a potential hazard as they may enter the roadway, requiring the ego car to remain vigilant and anticipate any sudden movements."
