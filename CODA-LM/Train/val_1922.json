The presence of this vehicle necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes as needed.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: There are signs indicating possible construction or road work observed on the right side of the road in the distance. These signs signal potential upcoming road work or lane closures, so the ego car should proceed with caution and be ready for possible road obstructions.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: Orange traffic cones are set up on the right side of the road, partially blocking the shoulder and extending into the lane. These cones indicate roadwork or a hazard ahead, requiring the ego car to navigate around them, potentially by changing lanes to the left if it is safe to do so.\n\n- **Barriers**: Red barriers are set up on the right, which may indicate a closed lane or a redirected traffic flow. The ego car must stay to the left to avoid these barriers and follow the guided traffic path."
