        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are several key elements to take into account:\n\nVehicles:\n1. A white car is positioned in the left-most lane, ready to make a left turn, indicated by the car's orientation and road markings. It is important for the ego vehicle to pay attention to this car as it could initiate the turn, particularly if the ego vehicle is also turning left.\n2. A black car is situated in the central lane, heading in the direction of the ego car and appears to be moving straight through the intersection. The ego car needs to watch this vehicle closely to keep a safe distance and prevent any possible conflicts.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- A motorcyclist is in the right lane, proceeding straight in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and exhibit extra caution because motorcycles are often less stable and less visible compared to other vehicles.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n- There are directional signs installed above the road indicating the proper direction for each lane with arrows, and there's also a 'No Straight Forward' sign for the left-most lane. These signs are crucial for safely and legally navigating through the intersection, as they inform drivers of the permitted maneuvers for each lane.\n\nTraffic Lights:\n- A green traffic light is operational for the lanes going straight, allowing vehicles in those lanes to move ahead. Conversely, there is a red arrow signal for the left-most lane, requiring vehicles in that lane to wait until the arrow turns green before making a left turn.\n\nBarriers:\n- Road barriers have been placed on the right side of the road, causing a reduction in the number of lanes available for use. This likely suggests nearby road work or an obstruction and might necessitate traffic to merge to the left, which could potentially disrupt the usual flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects reported in the given scene. These observations are critical for the autonomous driving system to navigate safely through the intersection and adapt to the movements of nearby vehicles and road conditions."

It usually separates traffic in different directions, acts as a refuge for pedestrians crossing the street, and can contain traffic signs or signals. In this driving scenario, the presence of a traffic island demands caution, as it indicates a separation of directional traffic flows or may indicate an area where pedestrians could be crossing.",
