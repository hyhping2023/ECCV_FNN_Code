There is a white sedan directly in front of the ego car with its brake lights on and it is stationary. This vehicle is influencing the ego car's behavior by indicating a stopped traffic condition ahead, requiring the ego car to also remain stationary. Additionally, a yellow construction vehicle is present in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. This large, stationary vehicle has its warning lights on and is potentially causing a slowdown or obstruction in the traffic flow.\n\nFurthermore, a red traffic light is visible above the construction vehicle, indicating that the traffic in the ego car's lane is required to stop, thereby influencing the ego car to remain stationary."

It can be identified by its large size and the heavy-duty equipment it carries, including visible elements that suggest it is utilized for works such as earth moving or transporting construction materials. This type of vehicle often moves slower than typical cars and may make frequent stops or sudden movements as it accesses construction sites. The presence of this vehicle in traffic demands increased vigilance from the ego car's driver. The driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected halts or slow travel speeds from the construction vehicle, enhancing safety and reaction time in the traffic environment.",
