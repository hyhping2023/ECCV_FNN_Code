        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, among the categorized road users, there are vulnerable road users and other objects present, while categories like vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers report no observations.\n\nA pedestrian is noticed standing on the sidewalk to the right side. The pedestrian is donned in dark clothing and appears to be distracted, with their attention directed away from the road. Despite not being directly on the road, their close proximity to the curb signifies the need for vigilant monitoring. This is because there's a potential risk of them entering the roadway unexpectedly, which could require immediate reaction from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, the scene contains other objects, specifically piles of garbage bags and miscellaneous items, situated on the shoulder of the road on the right side. These objects are notably encroaching upon the parking lane. The presence of these items is a concern as they could obscure the visibility of potential hazards. Consequently, the ego vehicle might need to keep a safe distance or, if necessary, change lanes to sidestep any obstructions and ensure safe passage.\n\nOverall, considering the traffic image, the primary focus for the ego vehicle would involve closely monitoring the pedestrian's movements due to their unpredictability and navigating safely around obstructions created by piled-up garbage and items on the road."

Objects like these, if spotted in the path of a vehicle, should be carefully approached or avoided if possible. The bag poses a risk of obstructing the vehicles path, and depending on its contents, it could potentially cause damage if driven over. It also indicates the possibility of waste disposal or cleaning activities nearby, which may involve pedestrians or workers entering the roadway unexpectedly. As a precaution, the speed should be reduced, and readiness to stop the vehicle if necessary should be heightened.",
