Due to this oncoming traffic, our vehicle must ensure to maintain proper lane discipline and avoid any sudden lane changes that might result in a dangerous head-on collision.\n\nSecondly, there's a truck located directly ahead in the same lane as our vehicle. The truck has reflective decals and may be moving at a slower speed. This situation calls for our vehicle to keep a safe distance from the truck, accommodating for the need for a longer stopping distance or extra space to maneuver in case overtaking becomes necessary, assuming it's safe and legal to do so.\n\nAdditionally, a red traffic light is visible ahead on the right side. Our vehicle will need to prepare to come to a complete stop in response to this traffic light, obeying traffic laws and maintaining safety for everyone on the road.\n\nThere are also traffic cones arranged in a line alongside the right edge of our lane, possibly indicating upcoming roadwork or a narrowing of the lane. Our vehicle must navigate this safely by avoiding the cones and potentially merging to the left if the way forward is impeded, all while being cautious of other traffic.\n\nLastly, temporary yellow barriers are on the right side of the road, serving as a boundary for ongoing road work or an area that vehicles must stay clear of. We must ensure that our vehicle does not cross these barriers and remains within the appropriate driving lane. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects have been reported in the scene."

Overtaking the truck should only be considered if it's safe, legal, and after the traffic light has turned green. It is crucial to continually monitor the road for any changes or additional information that may affect safe driving decisions."
