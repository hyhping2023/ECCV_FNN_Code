        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present, therefore there's no need to consider them in driving behavior for the moment.\n\nA traffic sign is visible indicating a divided highway ahead with a left merge. The presence of this sign alerts the ego vehicle to the upcoming split in the road where traffic will merge from the left, necessitating readiness to adjust speed and positioning to ensure safety.\n\nAn orange and white traffic cone is situated on the right side of the right lane, signaling potential road work or hazards. The driver of the ego vehicle is advised to maintain a safe following distance and consider changing lanes if the current lane becomes unsuitable for safe travel due to the indicated obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow and black striped barrier positioned on the right side of the split road. This barrier serves to guide traffic, indicating to the ego vehicle and others to keep to the left as directed by road markings and arrows. Such barriers are crucial in maintaining orderly traffic flow and preventing accidents in areas of road division.\n\nFinally, there is a wind sock off to the left, displaying the wind direction. While it does not require an immediate change in driving behavior, it is an important indicator for potential crosswinds that could affect the vehicle's stability, especially for taller, high-profile vehicles that are more susceptible to wind influences. It serves as a reminder for the driver to be prepared to counteract any lateral forces if necessary."

For the future driving behavior of the ego car, this barrier serves as a clear indicator that the vehicle must not proceed through the blocked road and should instead seek an alternative route or follow the directions provided, if any, to navigate past or around the barrier.",

The future driving behavior of the ego car should be influenced by the state of this traffic light; for instance, if the light is red, the vehicle must stop; if it is green, the vehicle may proceed.
