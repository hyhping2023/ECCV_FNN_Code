            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixing truck. It is a large, heavy machinery used primarily for mixing and transporting concrete for construction projects. The vehicles presence on or near the driving path suggests potential interruptions or restrictions in the normal flow of traffic. The size and operations of such a vehicle could lead to reduced road space and slower traffic speeds. As a result, the ego car must exercise increased caution, potentially reducing speed and maintaining a safe distance to avoid collisions or accidents caused by sudden stops or turns from the construction vehicle.",

Overtaking should only be considered if there's a clear view of the opposing lane and adequate space for a safe maneuver, which may not be possible before the bend. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the truck for any turning signals or changes in speed that demand further reaction."
