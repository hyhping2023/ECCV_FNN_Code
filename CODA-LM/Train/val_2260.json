Although stationary, it should be monitored in case it starts moving.\n   - **Large Construction Vehicle**: This vehicle is occupying most of the ego car's lane ahead and is facing away from the ego car. It poses a potential obstruction, requiring the ego car to either change lanes or slow down to maintain a safe distance.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - **Pedestrian**: A pedestrian is walking along the side of the road towards the ego car, on the same side as the parked white SUV. Due to their proximity to the travel path, there is an increased risk of a potential accident. The ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop if the pedestrian steps onto the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

It should be verified that the right lane is clear before making the maneuver, and turn signals should be used to indicate the intention to other road users. The presence of any potential oncoming traffic on this two-way road also needs to be assessed."
