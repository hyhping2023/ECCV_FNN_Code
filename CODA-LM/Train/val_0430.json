Beginning with the vehicles, there are two observed:\n\n1. A silver hatchback is situated directly in front of the ego car, with its brake lights on, signaling a reduction in speed or a complete stop. For the ego vehicle, this means a need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop.\n\n2. A white sedan is detected moving across the intersection from left to right, along a path that is perpendicular to the ego vehicle's trajectory. The sedan's movements are critical as it has the priority based on the traffic signal facing the ego vehicle.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there is a pedestrian crossing the street from the right to the left in front of the white sedan. The pedestrian is within a marked crosswalk which indicates the necessity for the ego vehicle to yield, as per the road rules regarding pedestrian priority in crosswalks.\n\nLastly, a red traffic light is installed above the road and is faced by the ego vehicle. The red light legally obliges the ego vehicle to come to a full halt and prohibits it from crossing the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nNo items such as traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects have been mentioned in the data, which implies there are none affecting the driving conditions in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle."

The red signal specifically instructs vehicles and pedestrians to stop and wait until it changes to green before proceeding. This direct effect would mean that the ego car, along with other traffic facing this light, must remain halted, preventing any forward movement until the light permits.",

It should also be prepared for pedestrians potentially crossing and monitor any changes in the traffic light. The wet road conditions mean that extra caution is needed due to reduced grip. No action should be taken until the traffic light turns green and it is safe to proceed with consideration given to other road users and conditions."
