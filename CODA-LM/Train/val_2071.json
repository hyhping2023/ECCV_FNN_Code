        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two primary vehicles of interest. The first is a large yellow construction vehicle equipped with an articulated arm. It is parked such that it partially occupies the road as well as the sidewalk on the right side ahead of the ego vehicle and is facing the same direction. The positioning of this vehicle could potentially block the ego car's lane, requiring the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to ensure safe passage.\n\nAdditionally, there is a grey truck on the left side of the ego car. The truck is carrying a large cargo and is moving in the same direction as the ego car, but only part of it is visible from the ego car's current perspective. The presence of the grey truck necessitates caution for the ego car. It may present a potential hazard if the truck changes lanes or makes any unpredictable movements; hence, the ego car should remain at a safe following distance and stay alert to respond appropriately to any such actions.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the traffic image under consideration."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically an excavator, characterized by its large size and yellow color. It is equipped with a substantial articulating arm and a digging bucket, typically used for heavy construction and excavation tasks. In the driving scenario, the presence of this construction vehicle on the road suggests possible road work or construction activity ahead. This may influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed, increased vigilance, and potentially a change in the driving lane to maintain safety and comply with traffic regulations pertaining to construction zones.",
