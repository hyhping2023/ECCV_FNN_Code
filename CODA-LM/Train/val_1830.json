Although it is unclear whether the car is moving or stationary, it is important to closely monitor its behavior in order to adjust the ego car's speed accordingly and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is an orange warning road sign on the right side of the road indicating that there may be road work or a detour ahead, with the sign pointing to the right. As a result, the ego car must be prepared to potentially change lanes or follow a detour due to the upcoming road conditions.\n\nThe road also features white fencing barriers on both sides, creating a narrow pathway for vehicles to pass through. The presence of these barriers means that traffic is confined to a specific path and the available width of the road is reduced. Therefore, drivers should reduce speed and proceed with increased caution."
