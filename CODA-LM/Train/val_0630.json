The vehicles present include an SUV parked on the right side of the road, which is silver-colored and faces away from the ego car, leading to a reduction in the available lane width that could potentially affect traffic flow. Additionally, a white-colored compact car is parked further down the same side, facing away from the ego car as well, narrowing the usable road width and possibly obscuring pedestrians stepping out from behind it. A series of parked cars of various colors continues down the right side, all facing away from the ego car, presenting a continuous reduction in lane width that requires vigilance for any sudden movements or doors opening.\n\nVulnerable road users are represented by pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right, including one individual who is closer to the edge of the curb, increasing the risk of a pedestrian stepping onto the roadway.\n\nTraffic signs noted in the scene include a pedestrian crossing sign located on the right sidewalk ahead of the ego car. This sign indicates a designated pedestrian crossing area and necessitates increased driver attention for potential people crossing the road.\n\nRed and white traffic cones have been placed in the road, creating a makeshift barrier that narrows the driving path. These cones are directing traffic flow and indicate that the ego car must navigate through a restricted path, necessitating a reduction in speed and careful maneuvering.\n\nAdditionally, a large blue structure with a ladder is placed on the sidewalk to the right of the road. Though this object is on the sidewalk, its size and the potential for activity around it, such as maintenance work, mean the ego car should remain vigilant for unexpected movements in this area.\n\nThis traffic scene emphasizes the importance of awareness and cautious driving due to the mixture of stationary obstacles like parked vehicles and dynamic elements such as pedestrians near the roadway."
