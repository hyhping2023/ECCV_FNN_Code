        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image viewed, there are various road users and traffic control devices that influence the behavior of the ego car. Starting with vehicles, there is a bus on the opposite side of the intersection that is stopped due to a red light. This bus is facing parallel to the ego car's direction and positioned in the opposite lane. Its presence requires the ego car to halt. Additionally, there are other vehicles in the adjacent lane to the ego car's left, which are also waiting for the traffic signal. These vehicles are headed in the same direction as the ego car, and their response to the traffic light will indicate when it is safe for the ego car to proceed.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian wearing a yellow top crossing the street at a zebra crossing to the ego car's right. The pedestrian's right of way obligates the ego car to wait until they have safely crossed. To the ego car's left on the sidewalk corner, another person is seemingly preparing to cross the street, and their movement could impact when the ego car will be able to make a turn or continue driving once the signal changes. Furthermore, there is a dog on a leash close to the person waiting to cross. The unpredictability of the animal adds an additional layer of caution that must be observed by the ego car.\n\nRegarding traffic signals, there is a green light permitting vehicles in the left turn lane to cross the intersection, which does not directly affect the ego car's lane. Importantly for the ego car, the traffic light for lanes going straight or turning right is red, requiring the ego car to fully stop at the intersection.\n\nThere is no mention of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects within the image, indicating that these items are either absent or not relevant in this scenario and therefore do not need to be considered by the ego car."
