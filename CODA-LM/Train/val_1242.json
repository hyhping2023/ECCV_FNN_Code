The ego car should carefully monitor these pedestrians, as they might decide to cross the street, potentially requiring the car to yield. Additionally, an animal, specifically a black dog, is seen on the road on the right side. This poses a potential hazard, making it necessary for the ego car to be ready to slow down or stop to avoid an accident.\n\nA traffic light on the right side of the image shows a green light in the direction the ego car is heading. This green light grants the ego car the right of way to proceed, but it should continue to be aware of the mentioned pedestrians and animal, as their actions may still affect its right of way."
