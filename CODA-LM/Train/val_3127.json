The construction vehicle is notable for the equipment that extends horizontally from it. This vehicle is stationary and its presence obstructs a portion of the lane, potentially blocking the path of the ego car and requiring it to adjust its driving behavior accordingly.

Due to its size and slower speed, the presence of this truck influences the driving behavior of the ego car by potentially requiring the driver to slow down, maintain a safe following distance, or consider changing lanes if overtaking is necessary and safe under current traffic conditions.",
