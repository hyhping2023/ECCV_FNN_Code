The presence of this vehicle requires careful attention as it could influence the autonomous vehicle's lane choice and speed due to its proximity and speed.\n\nAdditionally, there are cars in the oncoming traffic lanes on the left, moving in the opposite direction. While these don't have a direct impact on the immediate driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle, they still must be monitored in case of any sudden or unexpected maneuvers.\n\nThe highway scene also includes orange traffic cones aligned in the rightmost lane, serving as a signal that there is either a lane closure or roadwork ahead. If the autonomous vehicle were travelling in that lane, it would need to change lanes to avoid the obstruction.\n\nFurthermore, there is a red and white barrier running along the right side of the road, between the pedestrian walkway and the road. This barrier serves to protect pedestrians and doesn't pose a direct concern for the autonomous vehicle, as long as the vehicle remains within the designated driving lanes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects present in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."
