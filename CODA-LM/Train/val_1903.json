        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are two vehicles presented that are of importance. Firstly, there is a large truck parked on the right side, which is partially occupying the lane intended for the ego car. The truck's considerable size and its intrusion into the lane could significantly hamper both the maneuverability and the view ahead for the ego car, presenting a potential hazard. Secondly, a silver sedan is also noted ahead on the left side, positioned under the rear of the truck, indicating its close proximity to the ego car's lane. The presence of the sedan suggests it may need to slow down or come to a halt due to the obstructing truck ahead. This behavior could necessitate the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly to maintain safety. According to the analyzed data, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in this particular image, focusing the attention strictly on the interactions and implications of the two mentioned vehicles."

            "description and explanation": "Displayed is a commercial truck, particularly its rear end, suggesting a heavy and potentially slow-moving vehicle. In driving scenarios, heavy vehicles like this one tend to accelerate and decelerate more slowly than smaller vehicles. Ego car should maintain a safe following distance to allow sufficient reaction time if the truck brakes suddenly. The width and height of the truck may also restrict visibility for the driver of the ego car, requiring heightened alertness to anticipate beyond what is immediately visible around the truck.",

Additionally, the driver should be cautious and ready to brake if the truck makes any sudden maneuvers that might affect the ego vehicle's path of travel."
