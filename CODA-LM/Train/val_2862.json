            "description and explanation": "This object is a bus that appears on the right side of the ego car's lane. The bus is currently in motion, presumably traveling at a similar speed to that of other vehicles on the roadway. The presence of this bus influences future driving behavior significantly. The ego car must maintain a safe distance from the bus to allow for sufficient reaction time in case the bus slows down or stops suddenly. Furthermore, the ego car should be aware of the bus's larger blind spots and maintain a visible position in traffic to avoid being in these blind spots. Caution should remain elevated, as buses frequently make sudden stops to pick up or drop off passengers, which may require nearby vehicles, including the ego car, to quickly adjust their speed or change lanes to avoid a collision.",
