The vehicle's trunk is open, indicating that it might be in the process of unloading goods. Due to the vehicle's open trunk and its location close to the driving lane, there is a possibility that it might partially obstruct the lane, creating a potential hazard for the ego car. The ego car may need to execute a maneuver to safely navigate past this obstruction.\n\nAdditionally, there are individuals standing near the open trunk of this parked vehicle, seemingly involved in either loading or unloading activities. These people are positioned near the edge of the driving lane, and their proximity raises the need for the ego car to remain vigilant. There is a risk that they might step into the driving lane, which requires the ego car to be cautious to prevent any dangerous interactions.\n\nFurthermore, a pedestrian crossing sign is present on the right side of the road further ahead, and it is accompanied by a supplementary plate indicating a zebra crossing location. This particular sign serves as a warning to the ego car that there is a designated area ahead where pedestrians may cross the road. Consequently, the ego car will need to be prepared to stop or yield at the crossing to ensure the safety of any pedestrians that may enter the roadway. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that are pertinent to the navigation and decision-making processes of the ego car in this instance."
