        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image being analyzed, there is a large industrial vehicle identified as a crane truck with the brand 'ZOOMLION' on the back. It is occupying the right lane and extending partially into the left lane, which is the lane the ego car is driving in. Due to the vehicle's considerable size and lane occupancy, it is important for the autonomous system of the ego car to maintain a safe distance behind this truck. The system should also be prepared to slow down or stop if the truck makes any unexpected maneuvers.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian dressed in dark clothing walking on the side of the road in the same direction as the traffic. Given their close proximity to the road, there is a risk if they were to unexpectedly step into the lane of traffic. The ego vehicle's driving system must carefully monitor this pedestrian to ensure any unforeseen movements are reacted to safely, maintaining the well-being of all road users.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this scenario that could affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

Additionally, the ego car should monitor the pedestrian walking alongside the road to respond quickly in case they step into the roadway. Overtaking is not advised at this moment due to the size of the large vehicle and the lack of visibility ahead."
