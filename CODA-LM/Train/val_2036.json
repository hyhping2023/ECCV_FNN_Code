These trucks and the worker's activities could lead to unpredictable movements, so the ego car should remain cautious and ready to stop. Additionally, there is a white sedan traveling in the same direction as the ego car in the left lane, which could potentially change lanes or slow down due to road conditions.\n\nWorkers in reflective clothing are also present on the right side of the road, close to the ego car's travel path. One of the workers is walking towards the road carrying an object, which could present a hazard. The ego car should, therefore, reduce speed and be prepared to adjust its path to maintain a safe distance from the workers.\n\nOn the right, there are various traffic signs attached to a blue pole, likely indicating construction or road work ahead. The ego car must adhere to the instructions or warnings provided by these signs.\n\nThe road space available to the ego car is narrowed by multiple traffic cones placed around the construction site and in front of the vehicle on both sides. These cones mark areas that are off-limits and require the ego car to navigate carefully within the limited space.\n\nA green fencing barrier is also on the right side, indicating a construction or work area. This barrier reduces the available road width and physically separates the road from the construction site.\n\nLastly, there is a bicycle propped up against the blue fence on the right side of the road. While it is not currently a direct hazard, its location should be monitored in case it is moved into the path of the ego car or if it falls over.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in the image, so this category is not applicable to the current driving scenario."
