It is heavily laden with what appear to be sacks or packages, suggesting its use for delivery purposes. For the ego car, recognizing this tricycle's slower speed and potential unexpected movements is crucial. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or wait for the tricycle to clear out, especially in tighter or more congested driving environments.",
