This might be due to roadworks or another reason, and as a result, the ego car should stay in the right lane.\n\nLastly, barriers are placed on the left side of the road, delineated from the in-use lanes by the positioned traffic cones. These barriers indicate a segregated area, likely for construction or maintenance work, and they are essential for the protection of both the workers and the traffic."
