Its taillights are lit, indicating it is moving away, though it is not an immediate obstacle. It is, however, worth keeping an eye on as the ego car approaches.\n\nAdditionally, a series of traffic cones with reflective yellow and black stripes mark a clear path on the road, presumably steering traffic clear from potential dangers or ongoing roadwork. These cones are essential in guiding the drivable area and ensuring the vehicle follows the correct path.\n\nFlanking the traffic cones are barriers set up on both sides of the delineated path. These barriers emphasize the guidance given by the cones and define the limits of the drivable portion of the road, likely due to construction or part of the road being closed for some reason."

It is orange and white, made of flexible plastic material for high visibility and durability against impacts from vehicles. This cone is placed on the road to indicate that drivers should steer clear of a particular lane or section, potentially due to ongoing road work or an obstacle on the road.

The placement of this cone influences the future driving behavior by indicating that the driver should navigate away from it, typically by shifting slightly to the adjacent lane to avoid the area marked by the cone, thereby ensuring safety and smooth flow of traffic around the obstruction.",
