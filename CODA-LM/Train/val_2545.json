This truck is a potential obstacle that may require the ego car to change lanes for safe passage.\n   - **White Car**: A white car is ahead in the left lane, driving in the same direction as the ego car. While not an immediate obstacle, the white car's speed and behavior will influence the ego car's driving decisions.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - **Road Worker**: A road worker wearing a reflective orange vest is standing next to traffic cones on the right side of the road. This indicates potential road work or a hazard ahead, which may necessitate the ego car to slow down or be prepared to stop.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - **Bike Lane Sign**: A blue circular sign with a white arrow and bicycle symbol indicates a bike lane or shared path to the right. This instructs the ego car to be aware of cyclists and possibly share the road.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - **Traffic Cones**: Orange traffic cones are placed in a row next to the yellow truck, indicating a work zone or temporary hazard. These cones signal the need for the ego car to reduce speed and be cautious of possible workers or obstacles on the road.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects noted in the scene."

It typically has a bright orange color and is equipped with a reflective strip to enhance visibility. Traffic cones are placed on roads to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner around construction sites or accidents, or to indicate areas where drivers need to slow down or make lane changes.
