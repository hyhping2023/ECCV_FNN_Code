It is identifiable by its visible license plate and the construction equipment loaded on the back. The presence of this heavy vehicle is significant because it may move at a slower pace than other vehicles and might require a larger area to turn. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe distance behind the truck and be ready for any unexpected maneuvers the truck might make.\n\nTo the left front of the ego car, there is a green public bus situated in the left lane, which is displaying its route information. The bus's behavior is important to consider because it may make frequent stops to pick up and drop off passengers. Consequently, the ego car should exercise caution when approaching and overtaking the bus to ensure safety and smooth traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light ahead, which is currently green. It is mounted on the right side of the road and is vertically aligned. The green signal indicates that the ego car is permitted to continue moving forward. However, it is essential for the ego car to stay alert for any potential changes in traffic conditions, especially as it nears intersections.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

As the roads are clear, continue to drive with care and abide by general traffic regulations."
