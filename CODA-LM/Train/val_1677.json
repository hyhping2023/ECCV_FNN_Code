Additionally, there is a directional sign above the road to the left, signaling a left turn ahead for a detour, which may require the ego car to change lanes or turn. Traffic lights are also present in the distance, but their state is unclear, so the ego car should approach with caution and be prepared to react accordingly. Furthermore, there are multiple traffic cones placed along the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, which narrows the drivable path and suggests that there may be roadwork or an obstruction, requiring the ego car to avoid the coned-off area.

It should continue monitoring the road for any changes in conditions or unexpected obstacles."
