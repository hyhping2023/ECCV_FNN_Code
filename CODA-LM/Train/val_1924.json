This large yellow machine features visible mechanical arms and components used for digging and moving heavy materials. In a driving scenario, the presence of this vehicle indicates construction activity in the vicinity. The ego car must exercise caution, reducing speed and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle to avoid collisions and ensure safety, as construction vehicles often perform sudden movements and can obstruct parts of the road.",

It is advised to reduce speed, be prepared for unexpected obstructions, and obey any roadwork signs or signals that may not be visible in the image. Given that the scene is dark, it is essential that the car has its headlights on to increase visibility and alertness to any changes in the driving environment. Additional caution should be taken if the road is shared with any workers or other road users not visible in the image."
