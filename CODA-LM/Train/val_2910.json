There is a pedestrian crossing sign to the left, alerting the ego car to potential pedestrians in the road ahead.

            "description and explanation": "This object is a bus. As an element in traffic environments, buses are large vehicles used primarily for public transportation. They have a significant influence on driving behaviors, often causing delays and requiring ample space for maneuvers. Drivers behind a bus need to maintain an increased following distance to allow for sudden stops, especially in populated urban areas. This careful spacing is important because buses frequently stop to pick up and drop off passengers.",

Its presence on roadways can significantly hinder traffic flow and may lead to detours or reduced speed zones. Drivers encountering such vehicles should be cautious of sudden stops or debris falling from these vehicles. The size and operation area of construction vehicles also require drivers to give them a wider berth to avoid collisions and ensure the safety of construction workers.",

Traffic cones are typically bright orange and highly visible, with a reflective strip to catch the light during low visibility conditions. They are used to warn drivers of hazards ahead, redirect traffic flow, or safe-guard road construction crews. It's crucial for drivers to slow down and be alert upon sighting these cones to navigate safely through altered traffic patterns or nearby ongoing road work.",
