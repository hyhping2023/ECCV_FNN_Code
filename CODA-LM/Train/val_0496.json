Firstly, a white car is noticed driving in the opposite lane, facing towards the direction of the ego vehicle. It's crucial to keep an eye on this car to ensure it maintains its lane and doesn't pose a risk. Next, a large truck is spotted parked on the right-hand side of the road, in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car needs to monitor the truck for any movement or unloading activity, as it's an obstacle on the side of the road.\n\nFurthermore, several motorcycles and bicycles are parked on the left side of the road. Although currently unattended, there's a chance that a person may approach them to ride away, posing a potential risk. The ego car must remain cautious and ready to stop or yield if this occurs.\n\nIn terms of traffic infrastructure, traffic lights are observed ahead, displaying a green light. This indicates that the ego vehicle can proceed; however, it is essential to stay alert and be prepared to stop if the light changes.\n\nLastly, the environment includes various storefronts, signs, and trees along the roadsides. While these elements do not pose an immediate risk to driving, it's wise to be aware of possible pedestrian movement around these areas."

Speed should be moderated to ensure there's ample time to react to any unforeseen events, especially since other road users are present on the side of the road."
