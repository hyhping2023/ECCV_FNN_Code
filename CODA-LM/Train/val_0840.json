Additionally, there is one pedestrian on the right sidewalk, who is at a safe distance from the road and not directly affecting traffic flow; however, the ego vehicle should still be vigilant for any unexpected pedestrian movement onto the roadway. Furthermore, there is a mandatory travel direction sign (a blue circle with an arrow) indicating that vehicles are to continue straight, which aids in route planning and indicates that turning is not permitted at this junction. Finally, a physical median barrier is present, demarcating opposing traffic lanes to direct the flow of traffic and prevent the ego vehicle from entering oncoming lanes. There are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in this scenario."

It resides on the road, obstructing the lane directly in front of the ego car. The presence of this vehicle likely indicates nearby construction activity. For the ego car, this situation necessitates preparedness to stop or slow down and to possibly maneuver around the vehicle, depending on the presence of an available alternate lane or guidance from traffic signage or construction flaggers. Consequently, the ego car's driver must enhance alertness and reduce speed to ensure safe navigation through the affected area.",
