This situation suggests that the bus may start moving or passengers may disembark, potentially affecting the flow of traffic. Consequently, the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop to accommodate these actions.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is present on the sidewalk to the right, appearing to wait without any immediate intention to cross the street. However, since pedestrian behavior can be unpredictable, the ego car must keep a watchful eye on this individual in case they decide to cross the road unexpectedly.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image are not clearly visible, which means their current state cannot be determined. This uncertainty requires the ego car to approach the intersection with caution and be ready to stop should the lights be red or turn red as it approaches.\n\nLastly, there are several stationary scooters parked on the side of the road to the right. While they are not an immediate hazard, the ego car should remain vigilant for any scooter riders who may approach and enter the roadway.\n\nThe JSON data does not include any relevant information about traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers in the image, indicating that these elements are not present or not significant in this scenario."
