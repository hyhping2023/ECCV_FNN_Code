Itâ€™s important for the ego vehicle to keep an eye on these vehicles in case of changes in traffic flow or if lane changes become necessary, which might also require adjusting speed.\n\nOn the opposite side of the roadway, there are a few vehicles such as a truck, traveling in the opposite direction. While these vehicles do not have a direct impact on the immediate driving decisions of the ego car, they should still be observed to maintain overall situational awareness.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign on the right indicating there is a right curve ahead. This information is critical as the ego vehicle may need to adjust its speed and positioning in preparation for the upcoming change in road direction.\n\nRed traffic cones have been set out in the right lane of the ego vehicle's direction, hinting at a road hazard or potentially an area of construction. Due to these cones, the ego car will need to switch into the left lane to continue safely on its path.\n\nLastly, there is a construction worker seated near the traffic cones on the right side of the road, donning high-visibility attire. This indicates that there is likely an active construction zone, which means the ego vehicle should proceed with extra caution, staying alert for any unforeseen movements or signals."
