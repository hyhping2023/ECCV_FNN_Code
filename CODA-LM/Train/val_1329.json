Firstly, a brightly colored car with distinctive markings is parked on the right side of the road, facing the opposite direction of the ego vehicle. This vehicle might suddenly open its doors or start moving, so the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for any unexpected actions. Secondly, a white car is parked on the left side of the road, facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. The ego car should stay alert for any potential movements from this parked car as well.\n\nAdditionally, there is another object present, specifically a motorcycle or scooter parked beside the brightly colored car on the right. The ego car needs to be cautious as the owner of the motorcycle may return and potentially move into the roadway.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers observed in this traffic image."

It is positioned on the side of the road, indicating that it might be parked or momentarily stopped.
