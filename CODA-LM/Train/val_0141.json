This vehicle is critical as it determines the following distance and stopping behavior of the ego car. Additionally, there are various cars in adjacent lanes and across the intersection moving in different directions. The movement and position of these cars affect the ego car's ability to change lanes or proceed through the intersection.\n\nVulnerable road users are present, including pedestrians and cyclists crossing the street in front of the ego car on the crosswalk. They have priority, and the ego car must yield to them while they are in the crosswalk.\n\nThere are directional signs above the intersection indicating lane usage. These signs are important for providing information on how to navigate the intersection and which lanes to choose for the intended direction.\n\nThe traffic light visible right ahead is showing green for going straight or turning left. This indicates that it's the ego car's turn to proceed, but caution is required due to the pedestrians crossing.\n\nRed and white traffic barriers are on the right side of the intersection. These barriers are significant as they indicate areas that are off-limits for the vehicle, possibly due to construction or road work, and they influence lane choice and available space.\n\nThere are no traffic cones or other objects reported in this traffic image."
