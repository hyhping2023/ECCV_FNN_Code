        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there's a sedan directly ahead of our ego vehicle displaying illuminated brake lights, signifying it could be slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego vehicle keeps a safe distance and be ready to halt if needed. Further up the road, several vehicles are visible in the same lane as the autonomous car, with their red rear lights indicating slow-moving or stationary traffic, alerting the autonomous system to decelerate and stay alert due to the congested traffic conditions. Additionally, a larger vehicle, possibly a truck, is partially seen in the lane to the right, its rear lights lit. The truck's position and size might restrict visibility, so the autonomous vehicle should monitor for possible lane changes or merging traffic. \n\nAt a distance, a traffic light is observed displaying a red signal, causing the vehicles to halt and signifying the autonomous vehicle must also stop completely and await the signal change. Yellow and black striped traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, signaling that lanes may merge or shift ahead, and implying the ego vehicle might need to modify its lane position or merge right due to a possible obstruction or construction zone. Additionally, there's a barrier with reflective stripes on the left that seems to denote a lane closure or a lane merge situation, indicating to the ego car that it may need to merge to the right or prepare for lane restrictions directly ahead. No pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, other traffic signs, or objects beyond those mentioned are present in the scene."
