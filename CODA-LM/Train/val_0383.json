A red-colored sedan directly ahead in the same lane, maintaining straight-ahead travel. This vehicle’s presence may influence the ego car’s speed regulation and stopping distance.\n2. Another vehicle is observed moving away in an adjacent lane to the left, indicated by taillights. This vehicle may need to be monitored in case it decides to merge into the ego vehicle's lane.\n\nThere are also traffic signs:\n- Reflective signs are positioned on the right, possibly indicating road work or lane restrictions. These signs could affect the lane choice and travel speed of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones are visible:\n- Red and white traffic cones are placed to the left of the ego vehicle, likely indicating a closed lane or roadwork. These cones restrict lane usage and direct the traffic flow, potentially requiring a lane change if this was not already the ego vehicle's lane.\n\nLastly, there are other objects to note:\n- Some construction materials or debris to the far right beyond the cones. These materials pose no immediate threat but indicate nearby construction activity. \n\nNo other categories of road users were present in the image."
