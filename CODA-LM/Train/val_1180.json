This construction vehicle may be moving at a very slow pace or could be stationary due to its operation, potentially causing an obstruction in the traffic flow within that lane. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Additionally, the vehicle should be prepared to change lanes safely if necessary to maintain the traffic flow. Given the road surface appears to be wet or damp, the vehicle should approach with increased caution to allow for longer braking distances and to prevent skidding."
