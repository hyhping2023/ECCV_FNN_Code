This vehicle is stationary and not posing an immediate hazard; however, the ego car should monitor it for any sudden movements. Additionally, a white car is driving parallel to the ego car on the left side, slightly ahead of it. This vehicle is occupying the neighboring lane and maintaining its trajectory, necessitating that the ego car keeps a safe distance and is prepared for possible lane changes from this car.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are two pedestrians wearing high visibility jackets, walking on the sidewalk to the right of the ego car, one behind the other. Although they are not currently on the road, the ego car should remain vigilant as they are close to the curb and might enter the roadway.\n\nLastly, other objects include a series of green dumpsters on the right side of the road near the pedestrians and behind the sidewalk. These dumpsters are off the roadway and do not pose a direct threat, but they might obscure the view of any potential jaywalkers or animals that could emerge from between parked vehicles or the side of the road."
