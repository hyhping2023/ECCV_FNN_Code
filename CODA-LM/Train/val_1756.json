The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance due to the construction vehicle's size and potential for unpredictable movements or stops. Ahead of the construction vehicle, there is a blue truck in the same lane. The ego car must be prepared for the possibility that the truck may slow down or stop, thus maintaining a safe distance is crucial. Additionally, a white car is traveling in the left lane, parallel to the ego car, with multiple vehicles visible in the distance occupying both lanes. The ego car should monitor these vehicles for any lane changes or speed adjustments and respond appropriately.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users present in the scene.\n\nThe scene lacks any traffic signs that could direct or regulate traffic, which means the ego car must adhere to standard road rules and right-of-way principles. Similarly, there are no traffic lights visible to control the flow of traffic, so the ego car must proceed with general caution and rely on right-of-way.\n\nA metal barrier is present, separating the oncoming traffic lanes from the lanes going in the direction of the ego car, indicating that crossing into oncoming traffic is prohibited and that overtaking could be unsafe if visibility is limited.\n\nLastly, there are trees and a light pole to the right of the road. While they do not directly affect the driving scenario, they should be kept in peripheral vision as they could present hazards such as falling objects or pedestrians that might emerge unexpectedly."

Such vehicles are typically used in construction projects for lifting heavy materials. The presence of this vehicle in a traffic scenario implies potential delays due to either ongoing construction or the need for the vehicle to maneuver or position itself.

Overtaking should be done with caution, especially since visibility is potentially limited by the size of the road users ahead and the barrier to the left prevents moving into oncoming lanes. Speed should be adjusted to ensure there's ample time to react to the actions of the blue truck and the white car, which may shift lanes unexpectedly. Overall, defensive driving is recommended, with continuous situational awareness of the road users ahead and around."
