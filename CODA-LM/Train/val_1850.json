In this context, it appears to be placed near a wall possibly for storage or as a discarded item. From the perspective of the ego car, this object serves as an irrelevant item for driving decisions since it is situated beyond the driving pathway, indicating it will not directly influence the immediate driving behavior. However, the presence of such objects by the roadside can generally prompt drivers to be cautious about potential debris or unexpected obstacles in areas with nearby industrial or construction activities.",

Typically constructed from wood or metal, these reels are necessary for managing and transporting substantial quantities of cables efficiently. In a driving context, although stationary and placed securely along the side of the road, these objects must be noted by the driver of the ego car for spatial awareness.
