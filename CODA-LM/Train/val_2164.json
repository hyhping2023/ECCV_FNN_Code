The illuminating brake lights of the SUV indicate that it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. Additionally, a black sedan is located in the right adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, which may influence any lane change decisions and reflects the current traffic flow. To the right of the frame, a white truck is occupying the far-right lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The truckâ€™s size and position are critical factors to consider to maintain safe traveling distances and to anticipate any potential lane changes the truck might make.\n\nWhile vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not detected in this image, there is a traffic sign and traffic lights that impact driving decisions. A blue sign with directional arrows is present on the left side of the road, which is important for the ego car to understand the correct lanes to follow for its intended route. The traffic lights are displaying a red signal for multiple lanes, indicating that the ego car and other vehicles in the image are required to come to a stop and wait for the signal to turn green before proceeding."

The ego car should also monitor the black sedan on the right for any lane change maneuvers and prepare for traffic movement upon the traffic light turning green. Remaining in the current lane is advisable unless a turn is required, in which case a safe, signaled lane change should be executed after the traffic flow resumes."
