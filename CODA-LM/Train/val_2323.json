It appears to have its headlights turned on, indicating either an immediate prior use or preparation for departure. The activation of the headlights in dim lighting conditions like those seen in the image enhances visibility for the driver and signals the vehicle's presence to others nearby.

The ego car should also be on the lookout for any pedestrians or cyclists who might be obscured by the parked vehicles."
