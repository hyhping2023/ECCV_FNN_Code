In the distance, a white van is on the same side of the road as the ego car, facing the same direction.

This poses a potential safety risk and may require the ego car to slow down or change lanes to ensure a safe passing distance.\n\nTraffic lights are visible, with the left signal showing red and amber, indicating that it will soon be time to stop if the ego car is in the left-turn lane, while the right signal shows amber, advising caution for those moving straight or to the right.\n\nTemporary barriers are partly visible along the right side of the road, covered in green. These barriers restrict access to part of the roadway or a worksite, potentially narrowing the drivable path and impacting traffic flow."

Continued vigilance is advised as there may be additional obstacles or workers present near the forklift."
