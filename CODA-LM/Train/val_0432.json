This requires the ego car to reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, cars are noted in adjacent lanes, detectable through their reflections and lights. These vehicles aren't immediately impacting the ego car's path but should be watched closely for potential lane changes.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**: A traffic light displaying a red signal is visible at a distance. This red light mandates that the vehicles in the lanes it governs must halt, which likely includes the lane the ego car is in.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects have road users or items in this specific image, according to the analyzed data."
