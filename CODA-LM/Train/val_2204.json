The presence of a traffic cone on the road may indicate that there is construction ahead, an accident scene, or a detour. It influences the behavior of the ego car by necessitating a reduction in speed and increased vigilance. The driver may need to change lanes or maneuver carefully around the cone to avoid hitting it, ensuring the safety of both the vehicle and the potential road workers or obstructions ahead.",

Traffic cones are primarily used to signal areas that drivers should avoid, such as construction zones, accidents, or any hazards on the road. In this driving scenario, the cone indicates that there might be road work ahead or an obstruction on the right side of the road. The presence of the cone should alert the driver of the ego car to proceed with caution, potentially leading to a reduction in speed or a readiness to change lanes if necessary for safety.",
