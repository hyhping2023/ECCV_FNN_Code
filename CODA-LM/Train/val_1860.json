The presence of this truck is an immediate obstacle, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and to be ready to adjust speed or to change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic signs in view, including an ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) lane sign above the lane to the left, which lets vehicles equipped with ETC know where to go for toll collection. Also, there is a directional sign indicating that the straight or right lanes can be taken for a specific road, providing the ego vehicle with information regarding lane designations for upcoming routes.\n\nFurthermore, there is a green traffic light visible beyond the construction truck, signaling that the traffic is currently moving and the ego vehicle is permitted to continue on its way when it is safe to follow.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not have any listings for this particular traffic image, indicating that there are no such road users or items to be described or considered in the current driving scenario."

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle ahead, monitoring the truck's signals for any sudden stops or turns. Since the construction vehicle occupies the full lane width, a lane change might be necessary. The ego car should also be prepared to use the ETC lane or follow the appropriate lane as indicated by the directional signs. However, the car should only change lanes when it is safe, and there is no risk of collision with vehicles in the adjacent lane. Continuously monitor the traffic lights to ensure adherence to signals."
