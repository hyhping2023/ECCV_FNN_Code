This dense aggregation of vehicles heralds potential delays or slow-moving traffic ahead. As a result, there's a pressing need for the ego car to remain vigilant and preserve an adequate following distance to mitigate any risk of collision and accommodate for the reduced flow of traffic.\n\nAdditionally, visible on the side of the road are red and white plastic barriers or barricades. These barriers are indicative of some form of construction work or roadwork occurring in the vicinity. They act as a cautionary signal for the ego car to possibly reduce speed, prepare to switch lanes, or otherwise navigate around these potential hindrances cautiously to ensure safe passage through or around the area affected by these operations."
