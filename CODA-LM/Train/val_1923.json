The truck may be stationary or moving slowly, with its mixer drum, hopper, and delivery chute clearly visible, and its rear lights illuminated to show that it is operational. Because of this large vehicle's presence, the following distance might need to be increased, and it could be necessary for the ego car to consider changing lanes or overtaking the truck.\n\nTo the right, there is a traffic light that is green, positioned above at the intersection. This indicates that the ego car is allowed to proceed, but it must adjust its movement in response to the truck's actions.\n\nAdditionally, traffic cones are set up on the right side of the truck, delineating the edge of a construction zone or roadwork area. The placement of the cones creates a boundary that should be respected, reducing the width of the lane available for traveling and potentially necessitating extra caution or a lane change to maintain a safe journey.\n\nTemporary construction barriers are also present in the image on the right, marking off a section for construction or work, which may include roadworks. These barriers highlight an area that is off-limits for vehicles and signify to the drivers that they should reduce their speed and be vigilant as they approach the area."

Since the truck may obstruct the view ahead, caution is advised when changing lanes to overtake. Meanwhile, observe the temporary barriers and avoid crossing into the coned-off area. Because the light is green, the ego car has the right of way, but it should account for the potential unpredictability of the truck's movements and any roadwork activity. The ego car should monitor the truck's signals for any indication of turning or maneuvering, which may necessitate further adjustments to the drive path and speed."
