First, there are two vehicles noted; one is a large construction vehicle parked on the right side ahead, indicating possible construction activity that may affect traffic flow and pose hazards. The second is a small green vehicle approaching on the opposite side of the road, which requires monitoring to ensure it stays within its lane and does not affect the ego car's trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, there are vulnerable road users, specifically pedestrians on the right sidewalk. One pedestrian appears close to the edge, presenting a risk of unexpected entry onto the road, which necessitates heightened caution.\n\nA traffic sign is also visible, specifically a no entry sign for vehicles on the right side, signaling that the road ahead is closed to vehicular traffic from this point and must be complied with.\n\nThe traffic light in the distance is green, allowing vehicles to proceed in its direction. However, it's important for the ego car to keep an eye on this traffic light for any changes that may require adjustments in driving behavior.\n\nLastly, there are other objects near the stationary construction vehicle, including construction-related barriers, signs, and markers, suggesting changes in traffic patterns or potential detours. \n\nNo traffic cones or barriers are present in this image. The details provide a comprehensive overview of the conditions and necessary precautions that need to be considered by the ego car in this scenario."
