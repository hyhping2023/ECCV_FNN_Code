These vehicles may change lanes or adjust their speed, requiring the ego car to be prepared for varying traffic dynamics and potential hazards.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Directional signs overhead indicate lane directions and available exits. These signs inform the ego car of the upcoming road layout, exits, and potential lane changes required to follow a specific route.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - Traffic lights are visible overhead, currently displaying a green light for the ego car's direction. The green light indicates that the ego car can proceed, but it should remain alert to the traffic light potentially changing to yellow, then to red.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Traffic cones are placed on the verge to the right, indicating some form of roadwork or obstruction ahead beyond the ego car's immediate view.

Its presence indicates possible roadwork or construction activity ahead. For the ego car, awareness and caution are required when approaching this type of vehicle due to the potential for sudden stops or reduced speed as the truck may be preparing to turn into a construction site. Additionally, construction vehicles often follow different regulations on speed and right of way, prompting the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for unexpected movements.",

Lastly, continuously monitor the traffic lights and prepare to stop if they change to yellow."
