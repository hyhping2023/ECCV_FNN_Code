The truck is carrying a rotating cement mixer and has a wide rectangular shape. Due to the truck's size, position, and potential slow speed, the ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance or consider overtaking when it is safe to do so.\n\nAdditionally, there are white reflective traffic cones placed in a row on the right side of the ego car's lane. These cones indicate a separation or suggest that there may be road work ahead. As a result, the ego car will need to be careful and possibly adjust its course due to the cones, while also being mindful of the truck ahead."

For the ego car's future driving behavior, the presence of this construction vehicle suggests caution, maintaining a safe following distance, and being prepared for potential slow-downs or stops, as such vehicles often move slower and may make sudden or unusual maneuvers related to construction activities.",
