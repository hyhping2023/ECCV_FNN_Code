On the right side of the road, yellow and orange traffic cones indicate construction or roadwork ahead. These cones suggest potential lane closures or obstructions, and the ego car may need to change lanes if the current lane is affected. Furthermore, yellow temporary fencing is observed along the sidewalk on the right side of the road.
