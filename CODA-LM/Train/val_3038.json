        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, there is a noticeable road user categorized under vehicles. We have a dark sedan parked on the right side of the road, situated partially inside a darkened area. This particular placement and condition of the sedan are critical to the driving dynamics of the ego vehicle navigating this scene. The sedan occupies a portion of the roadside that is directly in the path of the ego car's travel. The combination of the vehicle's positioning and the inadequate lighting conditions substantially increases the risk of a collision. This heightened risk stems from the potential difficulty for the ego vehicle to promptly recognize the parked sedan due to the poor visibility, underscoring the importance of vigilant driving in such scenarios. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or additional objects are noted in the image, focusing the attention solely on navigating past the parked sedan safely."

It is positioned ahead on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, partially on the road. The presence of this car impacts the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating either a reduction in speed or a lane change to safely pass the parked or slow-moving vehicle, ensuring adequate space is maintained to prevent any collisions.",

It would be advisable to gently steer towards the center of the lane away from the parked car to allow sufficient clearance. Keep headlights and possibly fog lights on to improve visibility. Monitor for any indication of movement around the parked vehicle or emerging pedestrians that could be obscured by low lighting conditions."
