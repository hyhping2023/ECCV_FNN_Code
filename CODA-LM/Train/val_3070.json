The truck is characterized by its operational bright lights and visible rear safety markers, denoting its substantial size and the active role it plays in the current road situation. The truck's positioning on the road is crucial; it occupies the space directly ahead and appears to be partially veering towards the center. This particular behavior of the truck signals the importance of exercising caution and precision in maneuvering around it, highlighting the immediate impact it has on the driving decisions and behavior of the ego car navigating the same roadway. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects indicated in this scenario, focusing attention solely on the large truck and its implications for safe driving practices."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, characterized by its large size, heavy-duty machinery, and multiple visible working lights that illuminate its surroundings. It is typically used in road construction and maintenance activities. The presence of this vehicle can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed and increased caution. Drivers must be aware of possible sudden movements or obstacles related to the ongoing construction work. Safety considerations require maintaining a suitable distance from the construction vehicle to avoid accidents caused by debris or machinery movements.",
