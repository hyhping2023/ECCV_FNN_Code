The presence of the truck is significant as it may affect the ego car's driving decisions, particularly concerning speed adjustment and lane changing. The ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance and may need to consider overtaking if it is safe and appropriate to do so.\n\nAdditionally, two orange traffic cones are placed on the roadside of the right lane. These cones suggest there might be road work or an obstacle nearby, and as a result, the ego car should keep a safe distance from the cones to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nFurthermore, there is a continuous metal guardrail on the right side of the road, running alongside the traffic cones. This barrier restricts the vehicle from pulling over or leaving the road on the right side, thereby requiring the driver to remain within the lane boundaries.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The bright orange color and the reflective stripe are specifically designed to be highly visible to drivers at various times of day or in poor weather conditions. The presence of this cone indicates that the driver of the ego vehicle should stay alert and possibly adjust the vehicle's path to avoid the cone or to comply with modified traffic flow patterns suggested by the positioning of such cones along the road.",

Avoid drifting close to the right lane's edge where the cones are placed to ensure clearance from potential obstacles or road work. Continue to monitor for any signage or changes in road conditions that may affect driving behavior."
