Although the parked car is not currently obstructing the lane, caution is advised as there is a possibility of the car moving or passengers exiting the vehicle, which could affect traffic flow or safety.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is present in the foreground, crossing the road and facing away from the viewpoint of the ego car. The pedestrian's path and presence are critical as they directly influence the immediate driving decisions of the ego car to ensure safety.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are large cable reels tipped over by the side, which might be a sign of a recent accident or ongoing industrial activity. These objects do not block the road, but they serve as a warning for potential activities in the vicinity that could impact road conditions and safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
