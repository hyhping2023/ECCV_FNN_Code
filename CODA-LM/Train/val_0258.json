This vehicle dictates the ego car’s following distance, speed, and potential lane change decisions.\n   - Several vehicles in the adjacent left lane, parallel to the ego car, moving in the same direction. These vehicles may influence the ego car’s ability to change lanes or could potentially change into the ego car's lane.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A group of pedestrians is on the zebra crossing to the right, currently on the roadway. Their presence necessitates that the ego car should ensure it does not turn into the pedestrians’ path if a right turn is intended.\n   - Cyclists are in a designated bike lane to the right, traveling parallel to the road in the same direction as the ego car. The ego car must monitor the cyclists to prevent collisions, especially during right turns or while navigating through adjacent lanes.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Directional signs overhead indicate lane directions and upcoming intersections, providing information for navigation and lane choice.\n   - Road signs on the right side include a no parking sign, indicating parking regulations. These signs are important for understanding road regulations but do not directly influence the immediate driving behavior of the ego car.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The overhead traffic light is green. This indicates that the ego car and other vehicles can proceed through the intersection if it is safe to do so.\n\n5. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Traffic cones are set up along the right edge of the road, narrowing the usable road width. They signify potential road work or hazards, requiring that vehicles maintain a safe distance and may limit lane changes.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects present in the image."

Stay vigilant for the pedestrians crossing to the right and give them the right of way. Additionally, keep an eye on the cyclists in the bike lane and avoid merging into the bike lane or making a right turn without ensuring it's safe. Since the traffic light is currently green, proceed with caution, and prepare to stop if the light changes. Maneuver cautiously around the traffic cones, ensuring not to stray into the restricted area."
