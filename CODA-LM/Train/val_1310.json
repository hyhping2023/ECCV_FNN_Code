This vehicle is significant for the autonomous driving system to consider because it is directly in the path of the ego car and may be moving at a slower pace than the rest of the traffic. This situation requires the autonomous system to exercise caution and possibly initiate a lane change to safely navigate around the large vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle equipped with heavy machinery parts including an articulated arm that appears to be part of a drilling or excavation device. Such a vehicle is commonly used in roadworks or heavy construction projects. For the ego car, the presence of this construction vehicle suggests potential roadwork or construction activity ahead. The ego car should prepare for possible slow-downs or detours, maintaining a cautious speed and readiness for unexpected stops or reduced lane availability. It is also advisable to keep a safe distance from such heavy vehicles to avoid any potential hazards from sudden movements or operation of machinery.",

The driver should be prepared to change to the left lane if the larger vehicle's speed significantly reduces the flow of traffic or if there are indications that it might stop for work. Additionally, due to the reduced visibility, the ego car should drive with heightened alertness for any unexpected road users or obstacles that may appear suddenly."
