The presence of this construction vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be ready for a potential stop, or deceleration, to safely navigate around the vehicle's operation.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green traffic light above the construction vehicle, granting the right-of-way to the ego car and other vehicles traveling in the same direction. While the ego car has the right to proceed, caution is still advised due to the construction vehicle's location on the road, and the ego car should remain alert to the possibility of needing to adjust speed or change lanes.\n\nNo other road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are indicated in this scene, as those categories are empty in the provided JSON data."

Monitor the vehicle's rear safety lights for cues on its movements and be ready to change lanes if the lane becomes obstructed while adhering to traffic light signals. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car has the right-of-way, but caution is advised due to the large vehicle's unpredictable movements which could lead to a reduction in travel speed or require a change in the travel path of the ego car."
