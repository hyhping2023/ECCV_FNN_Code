The rear end of the truck is visible, including its brake lights and reflective markings. The presence of the truck significantly affects the ego car's driving behavior as it limits visibility, requires maintaining a safe following distance, and narrows the available maneuvering options. Additionally, several overhead traffic lights are visible in the distance, all showing green signals. This indicates that the ego car is allowed to continue moving forward but should remain alert for any potential changes in the traffic light as it nears the intersection. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that impact the driving conditions for the ego car."

The presence of this construction vehicle on the road indicates that there might be construction activity nearby. For the ego car, this implies a need for increased vigilance while driving, readiness to adapt to potential slow-downs, or sudden changes in traffic patterns. Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected stops or reduced speed of the traffic flow.",

Continue to monitor the traffic lights and be ready to stop if they change to yellow or red as the ego car approaches the intersection. Given the conditions, there is no immediate need for lane changes but be prepared to adjust position if the truck's behavior dictates it, or if an opportunity to overtake arises with safety considerations."
