On the right side, there is a truck that appears to be engaged in work activity near a construction area, which could move or unload unexpectedly, so the ego car should proceed with caution.\n\nThere are pedestrians on the left sidewalk, with one of them carrying a red bag. Since they may attempt to cross the road, the ego car must be ready to yield to them. A blue round traffic sign on the right indicates a mandatory turn or lane assignment, which the ego car must follow to comply with traffic laws.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights in operation for the current direction of travel, the ego car should continue to follow road signs and right-of-way rules. Red and white traffic cones are lined up on the right, marking the edge of a work zone and signaling a restricted area that the ego car should not enter, which also means the driving lane is narrowed.\n\nTemporary fencing and barriers are set up around a tree on the right, indicating construction boundaries that the ego car must not cross and should keep a safe distance from. Lastly, there are brown dustbins aligned on the right side of the road within a designated parking area; these are static objects that do not currently affect driving behavior but should be watched for any unexpected movements."
