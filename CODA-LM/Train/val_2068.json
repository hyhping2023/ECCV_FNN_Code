There are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the vicinity that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow traffic sign on the right indicating that there is a school zone ahead. This sign warns of a possible reduced speed limit and a higher likelihood of pedestrian activity, particularly involving children, in the upcoming area. There are no traffic lights visible in the current lane that would affect the driving behavior, meaning the ego vehicle does not need to prepare for any signal changes.\n\nFurthermore, there are no traffic cones present in the scene, so no adjustments or lane changes are required for them. However, there are metal barriers on the sidewalk to the right, which separate the pedestrian area from the road. While these barriers do not directly affect the driving path of the ego vehicle, they indicate that there is a designated area for pedestrians.\n\nNo other objects are reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
