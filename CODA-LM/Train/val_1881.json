The presence of these vehicles could influence the traffic flow, as they might slow down or stop in the same lane as the ego vehicle.\n\nOn the right side of the road, near the mentioned vehicles, there are multiple pedestrians, including children. Their close proximity to the roadway and the possibility of unexpected movements heighten the risk of an incident occurring.\n\nNear the orange taxi, there is also a stack of bricks or blocks towards the edge of the right-hand side of the road. These could reduce the available space for vehicles to pass and may necessitate increased caution.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image that impact the driving environment."
