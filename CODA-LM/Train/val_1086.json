The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n2. A gray truck is in the oncoming traffic lane to the left of the ego vehicle, partially obstructed by the white sedan. The truck's presence calls for caution as its large size could hide other road users or traffic signals.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n1. There is a cyclist to the right of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction along the edge of the road. The ego car needs to monitor the cyclist carefully and be ready to provide more space for the cyclist's safety.\n\nTraffic Signs:\n1. A 'No Parking' sign is on the right side of the road, above the cyclist's head. This sign indicates parking restrictions but does not have an immediate impact on the ego car's driving behavior.\n\nOther Objects:\n1. Utility workers and a ladder are present near the road on the left side, past the oncoming truck. Their presence suggests there could be unexpected movements or interruptions in traffic flow, necessitating increased awareness from the ego car.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
