Vehicles:\n   - A black vehicle is parked on the side of the road on the right, with its headlights on and facing the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this parked vehicle poses a potential hazard as individuals could enter or exit the vehicle unexpectedly, or it might start moving without any warning.\n   - Ahead of the ego car, there is another vehicle with its rear lights illuminated, suggesting it might be moving away or is stationary in the same lane as the ego car. The ego vehicle should be ready to slow down or change lanes if necessary to avoid a collision or if the vehicle ahead is moving slower or is stationary.\n\n2. Vulnerable Road Users:\n   - Two pedestrians are spotted standing close to the parked vehicles on the right side of the road. Given that pedestrians can be unpredictable and may step onto the road, the ego car must exercise increased caution.\n\n3. Traffic Cones:\n   - A series of traffic cones on the right side of the road is causing the lanes to narrow. These cones serve as a guide for vehicular traffic into specific patterns and could affect the available lanes, potentially necessitating a lane merge or adjustment by the ego car.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in the image that need to be accounted for in the driving behavior of the ego car."

Lastly, keep a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead."
