        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, various road users and signage have been identified, necessitating distinct reactions from the ego car for safe navigation.\n\nStarting with the vehicles, there's a red SUV driving ahead in the lane, directly influencing the speed at which the ego car can travel, as well as dictating its lane position to maintain a safe following distance. Also noted is a white van, parked on the left side of the road with its headlights on. This van requires the ego car to keep a safe lateral distance as it passes, to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nFor vulnerable road users, a pedestrian is observed walking on the right sidewalk near a shop entrance. The presence of the pedestrian necessitates a cautious approach from the ego car in case they decide to step onto the road. Additionally, a group of people is standing near a crossing sign on the right side, potentially indicating an upcoming crossing. The ego car, therefore, needs to be ready to stop should they move onto the road.\n\nThe scene includes several traffic signs of importance. A speed limit sign indicates a limit of 20 km/h, requiring the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly. There's also a 'No Parking' sign on the right side of the road, indicating that vehicles shouldn't park there to keep driving lanes clear. Lastly, a pedestrian crossing sign ahead on the right signals the possibility of pedestrians crossing the road, alerting the ego car to be prepared to stop.\n\nFinally, the road includes several orange traffic cones placed in the center, creating a makeshift barrier. This layout indicates a boundary or hazard that the ego car must navigate around, guiding it to remain in the correct lane.\n\nAltogether, the ego car must carefully navigate through this complex traffic situation by maintaining appropriate speed and distance from vehicles, being cautious of vulnerable road users, adhering to traffic signs, and avoiding physical obstructions such as traffic cones."
