The image reveals parked cars positioned along the roadside, identifiable by their illuminated rear lights and reflective body parts. The crucial concern with these parked cars is their proximity to the active driving lane, which introduces potential risks. Such risks include the sudden opening of car doors or pedestrians potentially stepping out from between the parked cars, which requires careful attention from any passing drivers to prevent accidents."

Its presence on the road necessitates cautious driving behavior, particularly focusing on maintaining a safe following distance. The vehicle's direction and positioning can influence decision-making processes in navigating, overtaking, or changing lanes, depending on its speed and the overall traffic conditions.",

This parked car has a significant impact on the driving behavior of the ego car, necessitating caution and potentially requiring the ego car to navigate away from its usual path to avoid a close encounter. The driver of the ego car will need to reduce speed and be prepared to adjust the vehicle's trajectory to safely pass the parked car while also watching for any sudden movements from it, such as doors opening or the car pulling out into the lane.",
