        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements that impact the driving behavior of the ego car. Firstly, there is a red forklift positioned on the right side of the road, by the roadside, and currently not in motion. Although the forklift is stationary, it poses a potential hazard. This is because it could become an unexpected obstacle if the ego car were to drift towards the right or if the forklift were to suddenly move onto the roadway.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic scenario includes a traffic light situated ahead, which is currently displaying a green signal. This green light is crucial as it grants the ego car the right of way, allowing it to proceed through the intersection without stopping.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of green construction barriers along the right side of the road is noted. These barriers stretch along the roadside and signal the likelihood of ongoing road work or a closed lane. This situation necessitates that traffic may need to adjust by shifting or merging to the left to avoid the barriers and any potential construction zone.\n\nIn this scenario, there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present that impact the driving conditions for the ego car. The summarized elements—comprising the stationary forklift, the green traffic light, and the construction barriers—collectively inform the driving behavior necessary for safely navigating through the observed traffic environment."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, identified by its upright lifting mechanism and the small cabin for the operator. This type of vehicle is commonly used in construction and warehousing operations for moving large or heavy objects. In this driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction work, which could lead to potential obstacles or deviations in the usual traffic pattern, such as reduced lanes or temporary stops. The ego car needs to approach this area with caution, possibly reducing speed and being prepared for sudden stops or detours.",
