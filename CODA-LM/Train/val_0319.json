A three-wheeled motor vehicle is centrally positioned in front of the ego car, traveling in the same direction and carrying a large load of water bottles. Due to potential instability of the load and the unique vehicle size, it may make unexpected movements. Hence, the ego car is advised to maintain a safe following distance.\n2. A white car is located in a different lane to the right of the ego car and is moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to be mindful of this car in the event it changes lanes.\n3. A truck is driving ahead in the left lane, also in the same direction as the ego car. The truck might block the ego car's view or slow down traffic, so maintaining a safe distance is recommended, and the ego car may consider a cautious lane change if needed.\n\nAdditionally, there is one vulnerable road user:\n- A cyclist is traveling along the right edge of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. To ensure the cyclist's safety, the ego car must pass with caution and provide ample clearance.\n\nThe scene also includes a few traffic signs:\n1. A no horn usage sign is round and situated on the right side of the road, emphasizing that the ego car should not use the horn in this vicinity.\n2. An overhead blue rectangular sign shows directions for lanes traveling straight or for left-turning traffic, which informs the ego car's lane choice based on its destination.\n3. On the left roadside, there is a speed limit sign with the number 50, indicating the speed limit is 50 km/h, and the ego car must adhere to or adjust speed to comply with this limit.\n\nA single traffic cone is placed on the right side of the road, near the sidewalk, hinting at possible hazards or nearby work, and suggesting that the ego car should proceed with increased caution.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported that affect driving behavior in this image."
