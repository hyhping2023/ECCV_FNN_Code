This parked car poses an obstacle, reducing the width of the drivable lane and potentially affecting the flow of traffic if other vehicles are present on the road. Alongside, a pedestrian is pushing a cart loaded with goods on the right sidewalk, moving in the same direction as the ego car. It's crucial to monitor this pedestrian as they could unpredictably enter the driving path. \n\nIn addition, a blue rectangular overhead directional traffic sign is visible in the distance where the roads diverge, providing lane directions with arrows to assist in lane choice based on the intended route. Lastly, there is a trash can on the right sidewalk close to the parked sedan. Although it is not on the road, its presence necessitates caution due to the possible presence of pedestrians or the chance of objects being near the driving lane. \n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other significant objects affecting the driving conditions in the image."

In the context of driving, the presence of this trash can near the roadway requires the ego car to maintain a safe lateral distance when passing by to avoid any potential collision, especially if the road narrows or there are pedestrians attempting to use the trash can.",
