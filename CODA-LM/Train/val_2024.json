        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are several key elements that influence the behavior and decisions of an autonomous vehicle, specifically focusing on vulnerable road users and traffic cones.\n\nFirstly, there's a child on a small bicycle crossing the road ahead of the ego car. This presents a significant safety concern, as children are unpredictable and there's a risk they might deviate from their path or potentially fall. The autonomous vehicle must approach this situation with heightened caution to ensure the safety of the child.\n\nAdditionally, an adult is observed standing near the bus stop on the left side of the road. While the adult is not an immediate threat to traffic, as they are off the roadway, the possibility exists that they could enter the road unexpectedly. Therefore, continuous monitoring of their actions is essential to preemptively respond to any potential road entry.\n\nAlso gathered by the bus stop on the left side of the road are several pedestrians. Their proximity to the edge of the road indicates a possible intent to cross or step onto the road unexpectedly, which demands the autonomous vehicle's attention and preparedness to stop or slow down accordingly.\n\nThe traffic scene also includes two traffic cones placed on the road, leading to a narrowed drivable path on the right side. These cones are indicative of a potential hazard or ongoing road work, guiding the autonomous vehicle to adjust its path and steer away from the cones to navigate safely through the area.\n\nThis scene is void of any vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that would otherwise impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle. Therefore, the primary focus for safe navigation in this scenario is the adjustment of the vehicleâ€™s path due to the presence of vulnerable road users and traffic cones."

It is typically used to communicate important information about the road conditions or traffic rules that apply at a specific location or section of the road.

Additionally, the car should steer slightly to the left while passing the traffic cones, ensuring not to enter the opposite lane. The overall speed should be reduced, and the driver should be prepared for any sudden movements from road users in this shared space, prioritizing the safety of vulnerable road users."
