Its large size and location near the intersection suggest a potential obstruction or slow traffic flow, necessitating attention and caution from the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is observed standing on a pedestrian crossing, facing away from the ego vehicle, and appears to be crossing the road. This pedestrian's presence requires the ego vehicle to yield and ensure the pedestrian can cross safely.\n\nThere is also a directional sign on the left side of the road, which indicates a junction or guides towards specific areas or streets. This sign provides location information and helps the driver navigate or make lane choices in advance.\n\nTraffic cones, bright orange and white, are aligned to block off a section of the road to the left, guiding traffic away from that area. These cones suggest roadworks or a closed section of the road, instructing the ego vehicle to stay on the correct side and possibly indicating a narrowed driving path.\n\nMoreover, red and white barriers are arranged in a line to delineate the construction site from the road, occupying the left side and some part of the road. These barriers serve as physical indicators of a no-entry zone, requiring the ego vehicle to keep to the right and avoid entering the coned-off area."
