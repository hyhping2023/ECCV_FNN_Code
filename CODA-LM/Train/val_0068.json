One worker is interacting with a vehicle on the left, while the other is walking along the right side of the road. Their proximity to the traffic lanes suggests that there is a potential risk of them moving into the ego car's path, which requires the driver to exercise caution.\n\nThe traffic signs in view include a blue directional sign positioned above the traffic light, which provides directions for the straight and right lanes. Additionally, there is a digital signboard on the side that displays information about road work. These signs are important for guiding lane use and alerting drivers to construction activity that may be ahead.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene show a green light for going straight and a red light for turning right. This means that the ego car is allowed to proceed if it's going straight but must come to a stop if it intends to turn right.\n\nA series of orange and white traffic cones are arranged diagonally across the road, leading to a narrowed lane passage. These cones are in place to direct the flow of traffic due to road work and indicate that the ego car should be cautious when navigating through the altered traffic path.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white temporary barriers situated beside the lane shift, in conjunction with the traffic cones. These barriers delineate the construction area, marking the boundaries of the work zone to prevent vehicles from entering potentially dangerous areas.\n\nThere are no other objects reported in the scene."
