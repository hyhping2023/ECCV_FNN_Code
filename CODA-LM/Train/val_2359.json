Additionally, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones to report. However, there are temporary orange and white barriers on the road, which signal a split in the road with an opening towards the right-hand side. These are accompanied by a large yellow sign with arrows indicating the detour path around the obstacle. The presence of these barriers requires the ego car to alter its driving path and take the detour to the right, following the indicated path. Furthermore, there is a stationary roadwork sign with a directional arrow placed before the split in the road. This sign indicates roadwork ahead and directs road users to the detour, guiding them away from the construction site to ensure safe navigation through the area."

            "description and explanation": "This object appears to be a portable or temporary traffic barrier used in traffic management. It is designed with interlocking segments, probably made of plastic or light metal, which are colored in white and reddish or orange stripes for high visibility. This type of barrier is commonly used to guide traffic flow, demarcate road construction sites, or temporarily block access to certain areas for safety purposes. For the ego car, encountering such a barrier signifies that there might be road work ahead, a detour, or a closed section of the road. The driver of the ego car should be prepared to slow down, follow alternative routes, or adhere to the modified traffic patterns prompted by this barrier.",
