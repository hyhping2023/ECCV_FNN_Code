To the left side of the road, a blue and white bus is parked, part of it slightly in the lane, which might influence other vehicles, including the ego car, to navigate carefully, potentially needing to merge to the right.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are several cyclists sharing the lane with motor vehicles, implying that drivers need to stay alert and may need to adjust their lane position to safely overtake the cyclists while maintaining sufficient clearance.\n\nThere are a few traffic signs present; a directional arrow indicates that the lane will curve to the right further ahead, instructing the ego car to be ready to follow the bend. A no parking or stopping sign is placed on the left, indicating drivers should not stop or park on that side. Additionally, there's a parking sign indicating available parking areas to the right, which suggests that the ego car should be cautious of other vehicles potentially entering or leaving parking spots.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic lights or barriers reported, orange traffic cones are aligned diagonally to the right on the road, signalling a temporary lane change that requires attention, as it might be due to road work or obstacles ahead.\n\nLastly, there is mention of trees and vegetation lining both sides of the road. These could limit visibility and necessitate extra caution from the ego car to anticipate any unexpected obstacles that might emerge from less visible areas."
