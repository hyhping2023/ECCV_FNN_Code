A group of cars is present on the left side of the ego vehicle, traveling in the same direction that can be seen through the windshield. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for any lane changes or stops these vehicles might make.\n2. There is also a yellow car visible ahead on the right side, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This car's position could affect the ego car's decisions regarding lane selection and overtaking maneuvers.\n\nVulnerable Road Users:\n- The presence of multiple workers wearing high visibility vests is observed on or near the road surface around the median strip. Their close proximity to the driving lane necessitates that the ego car reduce its speed and exercise heightened vigilance to ensure the safety of these individuals.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Several traffic cones are placed on the road, delineating a separation between the active roadway and the zone where workers are located. The cones signal a work zone and potential alterations to standard traffic patterns, dictating that the ego car must navigate the area with caution.\n\nBarriers:\n- A physical median barrier is located between lanes of opposing traffic, directing the flow and precluding any attempts to turn or cross over to the opposite side of the road at this segment.\n\nTraffic signs, traffic lights, and other objects are not present or relevant in this traffic scene, as per the information provided."
