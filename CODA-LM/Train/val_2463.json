However, the scene includes vulnerable road users. There are pedestrians on the right side of the road, walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The proximity of these pedestrians to the roadway requires the driver to operate the vehicle carefully, staying alert and ready to stop if needed to ensure safety. Additionally, there are cyclists on the right side, with one actively riding a bike and the other walking next to a bike, also heading in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of these cyclists means that the vehicle must navigate with caution, possibly adjusting speed or changing position on the road to safely overtake them."
