However, there are other elements that require attention. A 'No Parking' sign is visible to the right of the ego car, placed next to a series of traffic cones. This sign clearly indicates that parking is not permitted in the vicinity, advising the ego car to avoid stopping or parking in this area. Although there are no traffic lights identified in the image, which means they do not influence the driving behavior at this moment, the presence of traffic cones is notable. These cones are lined up, marking the boundary between the parking area and the roadway. Their placement suggests a demarcation of an area that should not be entered by road vehicles, possibly due to road work or it being a designated non-driving area. Additionally, there is a small shelter-like structure on the right side of the ego car, resembling a bus stop or a similar passenger waiting area. While this structure does not directly affect the driving path, its presence indicates that public transport vehicles may stop here, and pedestrians could be present in the area. This information collectively guides the driving behavior of the ego car, emphasizing caution and adherence to road rules."

Traffic cones are typically used to mark areas that should be avoided, such as construction zones or lanes that are closed for maintenance. The presence of this cone suggests that the ego car should stay clear of the marked area, potentially altering its normal driving path to ensure safety and compliance with roadwork or hazards.",

It is commonly used for security purposes, serving as a checkpoint for entering or exiting the premises. The presence of this guardhouse indicates that there might be controlled access to the area, suggesting that the ego car may need to stop and perhaps interact with security personnel or use an access card or code before proceeding. This can affect the driving behavior by requiring the driver to reduce speed and prepare for potential stopping and identification verification.",
