A motorcyclist, noticeable by their red jacket, is traveling in the same lane and direction as the ego car. The ego car needs to keep a safe distance from the motorcyclist to maintain a safe following distance. On the sidewalk to the right and parallel to the road, pedestrians are walking away from the road. They're not directly in the path of the ego car, but their proximity means the driver should monitor them in case any unexpectedly enter the road. \n\nNo traffic signs are visible in the image that would immediately influence the ego car's behavior. Similarly, while traffic light poles are within sight, the actual lights are not visible, and thus the ego car must stay alert for any traffic signals that could appear further on the road.\n\nThe road's right side is lined with orange traffic cones, suggesting road work or a new boundary for the driving lane, prompting the ego car to maintain a position more to the left and keep an eye out for possible shifts in the lane or roadside workers. There are red and white barriers visible as well, serving to demarcate the roadway from a construction area on the right and indicating restricted zones that could impact the flow of traffic or the width of the driving lane.\n\nLastly, a plastic bag is seen flying through the air on the left side of the road, above the traffic. While it doesn't pose an immediate threat to circulation, its unpredictable nature requires that drivers be wary of potential distractions or obstruction of vision should it land on a vehicle."
