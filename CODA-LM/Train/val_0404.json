This indicates that there may be a traffic condition ahead that requires attention, and the ego vehicle should prepare to slow down or stop to maintain a safe distance.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, there is a group of pedestrians who are currently clear of the driving lanes and do not appear to be trying to cross the street. However, their presence should be continuously monitored as they could potentially enter the roadway, necessitating the ego vehicle to take appropriate action to ensure safety.\n\nA 'No Entry' sign is positioned on the median to the right of the road, signaling that vehicles are not allowed to enter the oncoming traffic lanes. This sign directs the ego vehicle to remain in its current lane and not to cross into the opposite side of the road.\n\nAdditionally, temporary orange barriers are installed along the median, effectively separating the traffic lanes and prohibiting any vehicular crossing between the opposite directions of traffic. The ego vehicle is required to adhere to its designated lane and avoid any crossing maneuvers.\n\nLastly, there are bicycles at a bike-sharing station on the right sidewalk, adjacent to the roadway. While they are not in motion, the possibility of someone taking a bicycle onto the road exists, and therefore, the ego vehicle should stay alert to this potential hazard.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or traffic cones present in this image."
