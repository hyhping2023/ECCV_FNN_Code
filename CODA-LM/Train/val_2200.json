The presence of this large vehicle is significant as it affects the visibility and available space for the ego car, necessitating vigilant monitoring in case the vehicle begins to move or execute a turn.\n\nAdditionally, there is a reflective roadwork sign on the right side of the road, signaling ongoing construction or maintenance. This sign indicates that the ego car may encounter detours or a reduction in the number of available lanes further along the road.\n\nThe traffic light for the lane occupied by the ego car is green, granting the right of way to proceed through the intersection. Despite this, the ego car must stay alert for any changes in the traffic light or unexpected traffic movements that may arise.\n\nLining the right-side barrier of the road are bright orange and white traffic cones, which serve as a notification that a portion of the road is closed off for construction or maintenance. This setup reduces the width of the road and signals to the ego vehicle to stay within its current lane and avoid merging to the right.\n\nLastly, there are temporary barriers situated to the right of the ego car's lane. These barriers mark the construction zone and limit the available lane width, directing the ego car to maintain its lane position and keep a safe distance from the barriers."
