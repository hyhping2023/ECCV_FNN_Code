            "description and explanation": "This object is a heavy construction vehicle, specifically designed for carrying and mixing concrete. It appears to be a concrete mixer truck characterized by a large rotating drum on its back used for mixing concrete components. This type of vehicle is critical in construction projects for efficient transportation and use of concrete. In this driving scenario, the presence of such a large and slow-moving vehicle directly in front of the ego car affects driving behavior by necessitating increased following distance, slower speeds, and heightened awareness due to the potential for sudden stops or debris falling from the mixer.",

The driver should be prepared to react to the truck's movements and watch for the traffic light to change to a visible color, in order to comply with traffic signals. If the truck indicates a turn or there is an opportunity to legally pass, the ego car may consider doing so when it is safe, ensuring it does not violate any traffic rules or put anyone at risk in the process."
