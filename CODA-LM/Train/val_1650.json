It appears to be unoccupied. This parked vehicle could be a potential hazard if it were to move into the lane unexpectedly or if occupants were to open doors or step out into the roadway.\n\nAlthough there are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle, the night conditions and poor image quality suggest that there may be unseen vulnerable road users. Therefore, the ego vehicle should proceed with caution.\n\nA traffic sign is present on the right side of the road, but it is not legible in the image. The presence of this sign indicates that there may be important regulations, warnings, or information pertaining to the roadway that are not currently discernible due to low visibility.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are observed in the image.\n\nAdditionally, there is debris, which looks like waste material, piled on the side of the road near the parked vehicle. This suggests that the area may not be regularly cleaned and there is a risk of waste being present on the road. Such debris could pose a risk to the vehicle's tires and undercarriage, necessitating careful attention while driving."
