This cyclist is sharing the road with the ego car and must be carefully monitored as they could become a moving obstacle.\n\nAbove the road, there is an overhead gantry displaying directional signs with white text on a blue background. These signs are likely providing lane usage and route direction information, which will guide the ego car in its lane positioning and navigation.\n\nOn the left side of the road, traffic cones have been set up, indicating that there may be road work or an obstacle present. The presence of these cones suggests that the lane might be narrowed further ahead, and the ego car should be ready to adjust its path accordingly.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
