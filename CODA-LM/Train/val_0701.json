        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a silver sedan parked on the right side of the road facing the ego car. This vehicle is stationary but could pose a risk if it were to move unexpectedly or if passengers were to open doors into the path of oncoming traffic. Additionally, a red scooter is observed moving away from the ego car in the same lane, requiring attention for any sudden changes in its speed or direction.\n\nA cyclist is also present ahead in the same lane as the ego car, wearing red and moving with the traffic flow. Given that cyclists can be less predictable and are more vulnerable, the ego car must keep a safe distance and be ready for any abrupt movements.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road, signaling a potential crossing point for pedestrians and necessitating a cautious approach by the ego car. There is also a no entry sign indicating a weight limit above 20 tons on the right side of the road, adjacent to a construction barrier. This sign imposes lane restrictions, but it is not applicable to the ego car if it does not exceed the weight limit.\n\nThe traffic lights in the image cannot be accurately described due to perception limitations, which means the status of the traffic lights is unknown. This is critical information for determining the right of way but is unavailable in this scenario.\n\nOn the right side of the road, orange and white traffic barriers are present, marking a construction area. These barriers signal a work zone and limit the available width of the right lane, requiring drivers to exercise caution and possibly change lanes.\n\nLastly, there are other objects, including a green cover that likely hides construction materials and a concrete barrier near the traffic barriers on the right side. These objects indicate ongoing construction work and the potential for uneven road surfaces or unexpected obstacles."
