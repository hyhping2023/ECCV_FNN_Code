        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image under review, there are several notable features that must be taken into account for autonomous driving.\n\nFirstly, there are a variety of parked cars on the left side of the road, positioned parallel to the road. These stationary vehicles reduce the usable width of the roadway, and thus the ego car must remain vigilant for any potential movements or doors opening from these vehicles.\n\nMoving ahead, the road contains several vehicles in motion, which are distributed on both sides of the road within their designated lanes. It is important for the ego car to observe these vehicles, tracking their speed and lane adherence to adjust its own velocity accordingly and maintain a safe distance behind them.\n\nThe presence of a cyclist is observed in the middle of the right lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. In response, the ego car is required to decelerate and, if necessary, change lanes to safely pass the cyclist, ensuring an ample berth is provided.\n\nTraffic lights are located ahead on the road, although their current state is indiscernible from the image. Consequently, the autonomous system in the ego car should be geared to react to these traffic lights by preparing to slow down or stop if the lights are showing red or yellow, and to proceed with caution should they turn green.\n\nAdditionally, orange traffic cones are positioned on the right side of the right lane, which indicates that there might be a lane closure or that traffic should merge left shortly. The ego car should thus be ready to merge into the left lane if it becomes necessary due to a closure of the right lane.\n\nFinally, a pedestrian is spotted on the right-hand side, close to the location of the traffic cones. This situation demands the ego car to exercise extra caution and be ready to reduce speed or come to a halt if the pedestrian steps onto the roadway."

            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is an orange and white, cone-shaped object used for traffic management. It typically is deployed to indicate areas that are off-limits to vehicles, such as construction zones or lanes that are closed for maintenance or due to an accident. The visibility of the traffic cone's coloring makes it easily recognizable from a distance. For the ego car, this cone would indicate a need to stay clear of whatever the cone is designating, which could possibly be a closed lane or a hazard on the road. The driver should remain alert and potentially prepare to merge into another lane if the lane ahead is blocked.",
