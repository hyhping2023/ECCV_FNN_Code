It has an apparatus on its roof, suggesting it might be a special vehicle like a surveying or autonomous mapping car. It appears stationary or moving slowly due to traffic conditions ahead. This vehicle's proximity significantly influences the ego car's speed and following distance.\n  - On the right side, there is a yellow truck positioned partially in the construction zone and partially in the traffic lane, appearing stationary or moving slowly. This truck's position could reduce the available lane width for the ego car and may merge back into traffic, necessitating monitoring and potential speed adjustment.\n  - A construction or utility vehicle is on the left side of the road, heavily laden, indicating potential road or utility work. It appears to be stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle contributes to overall congestion, requiring the ego car to be cautious and ready to stop or slow down if necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - A \"No Parking\" sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating parking is not allowed in this section. This sign provides context but doesn’t directly affect driving behavior, aside from reinforcing that stopping roadside is prohibited.\n  - A road sign indicates a speed limit of 5 km/h in a construction zone, positioned to the right. This advises the ego vehicle to reduce speed significantly due to construction activities and possible presence of workers.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - A green traffic light ahead for the lane of the ego car indicates permission to proceed. However, caution is advised due to the activity and potential for sudden stops in the congestion ahead.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Orange traffic cones are placed in a line along the right side of the ego car’s lane, indicating that part of the road is sectioned off for construction or road work. The cones guide the ego car to stay within the confined space of the open lane and reduce speed as necessary due to narrowed lanes.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - Construction workers are visible near the truck on the right, indicating ongoing road work. The presence of these workers requires reduced speed and increased vigilance to ensure safety for all parties involved. \n\nThis snapshot emphasizes the need for careful navigation through a construction zone with multiple slow-moving or stationary vehicles, traffic control signs, and the presence of road workers."
