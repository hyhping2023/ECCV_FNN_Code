        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are noteworthy. Firstly, there is a blue sedan parked on the right side just beyond a toll booth. Its trunk is facing the ego vehicle and it is partially occupying the rightmost lane. This parked vehicle poses a potential risk as it could start moving or open its trunk, affecting the ego vehicle's ability to navigate through the toll area.\n\nAdditionally, a white taxi is present in the bottom-left corner of the image, although its exact position in relation to the ego car is unclear. The taxi's presence could indicate a loading zone or a temporary parking space, which means the ego vehicle should be alert to the possibility of doors opening or the taxi moving unexpectedly.\n\nAbove the scene, there is signage for the toll booth. While it is visible, it does not have a direct impact on the immediate driving decisions of the ego vehicle. The signage serves an informational purpose, indicating the presence of the toll booth but not requiring immediate action.\n\nNo traffic lights are in view, and therefore, they do not influence the driving decisions of the ego vehicle at this time.\n\nOn the road, there is a series of orange traffic cones leading towards a red-and-white barrier. These cones and the barrier are directing traffic to the left, away from a closed-off area to the right of the toll booth. The ego vehicle should adjust its path to follow this guidance.\n\nA red-and-white barrier is also present, positioned on the right side of the road, signaling that the area is off-limits for vehicles. This barrier requires the ego car to stay on the open portion of the road, avoiding the restricted area.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects in the image that would affect the ego vehicle's driving behavior."

The cone aids in demarcating specific areas to prevent accidents and ensure the safe flow of traffic by indicating areas that are off-limits or highlighting safe paths around construction zones, hazards, or other obstacles. In this driving scenario, the traffic cone indicates that the ego car should stay clear of particular sections of the road, possibly due to ongoing maintenance or specific traffic routing at this toll booth area.",
