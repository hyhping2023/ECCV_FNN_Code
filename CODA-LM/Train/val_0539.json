Additionally, there are various parked cars on the side of the road, limiting maneuvering space and requiring caution if any of them start to move.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, a motorcyclist is in front of the ego vehicle, also moving in the same direction. This necessitates careful observation due to the motorcyclist's potential instability and vulnerability. A cyclist on the right-hand side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, also requires attention, as cyclists might make unexpected moves, necessitating sufficient clearance when passing.\n\nThere are traffic signs visible which include a blue sign indicating a maximum speed limit of 40 km/h, setting the maximum speed for the ego vehicle. A no parking sign is up ahead on the right, indicating parking restrictions that may influence the behavior of parked cars.\n\nTraffic cones are aligned on the left side of the ego vehicle's lane, suggesting an area to avoid, likely due to roadworks or an obstruction.\n\nLastly, there is a green dustbin on the sidewalk to the right. While this object does not directly affect traffic, it should be noted for the potential presence of pedestrians."
