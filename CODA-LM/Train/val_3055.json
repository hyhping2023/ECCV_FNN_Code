        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are a few key elements identified:\n\nFirstly, a large cargo truck is present, driving ahead of the ego car within the rightmost lane. Due to its substantial size, the truck takes up considerable space and could potentially obscure the ego car's view of the road ahead. It may also necessitate greater following distances and influence the ego car's options for safe maneuvers.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian has been spotted walking alongside the road, close to the traffic barrier on the right side. The pedestrian's proximity to the roadway poses a potential risk, as an unforeseen step or falling object could result in an unexpected hazard for the ego car and other road users.\n\nMetal barriers are installed along both edges of the highway. Their function is to demarcate the limits of the roadway and mitigate the possibility of vehicles accidentally departing from the road. However, the presence of these barriers can simultaneously limit available emergency escape routes for vehicles attempting to avoid an incident.\n\nThere are no other road users or objects such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects reported in other categories of the scene, signifying their absence from the image."

Plastic bags on roads can be hazardous as they might get blown around by the wind or the movement of vehicles, potentially obstructing drivers' view or getting caught in vehicle components, leading to safety risks. The ego vehicle should maintain alertness and possibly adjust speed or change lanes if the bag moves towards the driving path to avoid any possible interference with vehicle operation or visibility.",
