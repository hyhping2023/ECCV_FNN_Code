Firstly, there is a silver sedan in the left lane, positioned ahead of the ego car. The presence of this sedan may require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, a black SUV is parallel parked on the right side of the road; however, since it is stationary, it should not directly influence the ego car's immediate movement. Moving in the same direction as the ego car, there is a red bus in the right lane, which may stop at bus stops, requiring the ego car to anticipate stopping or slowing down traffic ahead. Ahead of the bus, there is a grey compact car in the right lane, which might also influence the traffic flow.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are directional signs above the road indicating that both lanes proceed straight. These signs inform the ego car of lane allocations. There is also a no parking sign located to the right of the road, which informs about parking restrictions but does not directly influence the ego car's driving behavior unless it seeks a parking space.\n\nThe traffic lights include a green traffic light visible ahead for the lane the ego car is in, indicating that the ego car can proceed if the road conditions are safe.\n\nOn the road, there is a series of orange traffic cones positioned along the boundary of the left lane and a work zone, signaling a lane closure or restricted area next to the ego car that may influence lane usage and require caution. Metal barriers are lining the right side of the road, separating the sidewalk from the road, serving as indicators of a boundary that the ego car must be aware of to stay within the road limits.\n\nLastly, there is a black garbage bin near the edge of the right lane, just ahead of the ego car, which is an obstacle that might marginally narrow the drivable space in the right lane."
