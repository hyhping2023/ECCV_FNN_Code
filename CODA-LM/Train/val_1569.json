The presence of this heavy truck requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance because the truck has a longer stopping distance and could limit road visibility.\n\nA road sign is visible on the right side of the picture, indicating a left turn or curve ahead. This alerts the ego car to potentially reduce speed and be cautious of other traffic that may be slowing down to navigate the turn.\n\nAdditionally, metal guardrails are present along the right side of the highway. These barriers indicate that there is no shoulder available for stopping or emergency maneuvers, necessitating extra caution from the ego car when changing lanes or in case of the need to stop."
