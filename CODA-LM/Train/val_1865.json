Firstly, there is a white sedan parked on the right side of the road, partially on the sidewalk. This vehicle may limit the passable road width and affect the driving path of the ego car, requiring the autonomous system to navigate carefully around it. Additionally, a motorcyclist is directly ahead of the ego car, occupying the center of the driving lane with rear lights on. The motorcyclist's presence directly affects the ego car's speed and following distance. Extra caution is needed, especially under low-light conditions, to ensure safe driving and maintain an appropriate distance.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pedestrian walking along the side of the road to the right of the ego car. The pedestrian's proximity to the driving path poses a potential safety risk. The autonomous driving system must carefully monitor the pedestrian's movements to react promptly should they step onto the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
