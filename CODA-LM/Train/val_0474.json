Additionally, a row of parked cars is situated on the right side of the road, with the possibility of doors opening or pedestrians emerging from between them, necessitating a safe distance and readiness to stop. Furthermore, there are vehicles in adjacent lanes ahead of the ego car, moving straight, which will influence the flow of traffic and potential lane changes for the ego car.\n\nThere is a pedestrian beside a scooter near the right sidewalk, possibly about to cross at the crosswalk. This pedestrian poses a potential hazard as they may enter the crosswalk, meaning the ego car needs to be ready to yield.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, a No Parking sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating the ego car cannot park in that area, though this is not immediately relevant unless looking for parking. Directional signs are present as well, indicating straight lanes and a left turn lane, which the ego car should follow according to its intended destination.\n\nA red traffic light is visible overhead, requiring the ego car to stop at the designated stopping line at the intersection. Other categories, including traffic cones, barriers, and other objects, are not present in the image."

This moped is positioned to the right side of the ego car and is moving in the same direction along the road. In the context of driving behavior, the presence of this moped will require the driver of the ego car to maintain right-side awareness, particularly checking the rear-view and side mirrors for blind spots. The driver should also be cautious of the moped potentially changing lanes or adjusting its speed, influencing any lane changes or turns the ego car might consider.",
