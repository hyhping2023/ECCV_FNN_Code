        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there is a significant presence of vehicles and vulnerable road users, specifically a yellow construction vehicle and construction workers. The yellow construction vehicle is stationed to the right side of the road, facing the direction of the ego car. Notably, construction debris is partially obstructing the lane of the ego car. The position of the construction vehicle and the debris necessitates a lane change by the ego car to avoid potential hazards. Additionally, construction workers are visible near the yellow construction vehicle, also positioned on the right side of the road. The proximity of the construction workers to the roadway elevates the risk of an accident. Consequently, it is imperative for the ego car to reduce speed and exercise heightened caution while passing this area to ensure safety."

In the current driving scenario, it is parked on the side of the road with construction workers nearby, which indicates ongoing construction work. The presence of this vehicle can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed and increased vigilance to accommodate potential movements of the vehicle or nearby workers. The ego car may also need to navigate around the construction zone, potentially changing lanes or following detour signs.",
