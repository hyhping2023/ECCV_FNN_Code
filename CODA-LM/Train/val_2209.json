Several parked cars are situated on the right side of the road, some partly on the roadway, narrowing the drivable space and requiring careful navigation from the ego car driver. Located directly ahead of the ego car is a large yellow construction vehicle with an excavator on its flatbed, occupying the middle of both lanes and appearing to be moving slowly or stopped, which could obstruct traffic flow and necessitate the ego car to slow down or wait for a safe passing opportunity.\n\nThere is a single traffic cone on the right side of the ego car's lane, indicating a potential hazard area or road work nearby, suggesting that the driver should proceed with caution.\n\nTemporary fencing and barriers are observed along the right side of the street, signaling a construction site or non-driveable area, advising the ego car to maintain its lane position to avoid collision.\n\nVarious objects such as a dustbin and construction-related materials are scattered close to the roadside, suggesting that the ego car must be mindful of these objects as they may indicate the presence of workers or further obstructions not immediately visible."
