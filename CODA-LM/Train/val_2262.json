        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are several key elements to take into consideration:\n\nFirstly, we have a black SUV located on the left side of the road with its brake lights engaged. This suggests that the vehicle is either coming to a stop or slowing down. Because of its position and the indication that it is decelerating, it may affect the normal flow of traffic, and as a result, the ego vehicle must be ready to either slow down or change lanes to ensure there is a safe distance between it and the SUV.\n\nAdditionally, on the opposite side of the road, there are multiple cars lined up, one of which is signaling its intent to turn right. The queue of vehicles implies a likely congestion or bottleneck up ahead, and since one vehicle is executing a turn, extra caution must be exercised. This affects the ego vehicle's driving behavior since there is a requirement to be vigilant and be prepared to react to any sudden movements from the turning vehicle.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, pedestrians are seen on the right side of the road. Some of these pedestrians are in the process of crossing the road, and others appear to be alert to the vehicles, indicating they are engaging with the traffic. The presence of pedestrians in close proximity to the road means that the ego vehicle must be ready to stop or reduce speed to ensure their safety, highlighting the need for constant vigilance in areas with pedestrian activity.\n\nThe traffic scene also features multiple traffic cones positioned in a line down the center of the road, serving the purpose of directing traffic and keeping vehicles within their respective lanes. The ego vehicle must respect this temporary setup, and maintain its course within the designated driving lane.\n\nFinally, metal barriers are installed on the right-hand side of the road to clearly mark the separation between the area designated for pedestrian use and that intended for vehicular traffic. This installation directs the ego vehicle to stay clear of pedestrian zones, promoting safe coexistence between different road users.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are present in the image that require noting or that would impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
