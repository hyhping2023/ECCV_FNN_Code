The location of the truck may block the lane for the ego car, which may require the driver to change lanes or adjust the vehicle's speed to navigate safely. Additionally, there are noticeable amounts of debris or garbage bags lining both sides of the road, predominantly on the right, which could pose as physical obstructions. These obstructions could limit the drivable space, potentially conceal other hazards, or reduce the maneuverability of the ego car. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in this scene."

The bags are tightly packed and secured, likely to prevent any debris from falling onto the road during transport. For the ego car, this object poses a potential hazard if the load is not properly secured, as bags could fall onto the roadway, creating obstacles that require sudden maneuvering or stopping.",

Its presence on the road means that the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance, as these types of vehicles can make unpredictable movements or stop suddenly. Proper spacing will ensure safety for both the ego vehicle and the tricycle driver.",
