This vehicle could impact driving by potentially moving into traffic or if its doors open suddenly. A white car is spotted ahead on the left, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, requiring the autonomous vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden braking or turning. Additionally, there's a motorcycle parked on the right side, facing away from the ego vehicle, prompting caution in case it decides to enter the traffic.\n\nVulnerable road users noted are a group of pedestrians standing on the side of the road ahead, possibly waiting to cross, which may lead to the ego vehicle having to stop for them to cross safely. Individuals wearing high-vis vests are seen standing in the road, likely managing traffic, which could mean the ego vehicle might have to stop or detour as directed.\n\nAmong traffic signs, there's a pedestrian crossing sign on the left side of the road, signaling a spot where pedestrians may be crossing, thus requiring heightened caution. A no entry sign for a side street on the right highlights a road that the ego vehicle should not turn into.\n\nTraffic lights were not spotted in the image, implying the ego vehicle must depend on other navigation cues like traffic police or road signs.\n\nA barrier, specifically temporary fencing on the right, encloses a construction area, indicating there may be an altered road layout or obstructions, necessitating careful navigation.\n\nNo traffic cones or other objects were observed in the image, which simplifies the scene but still demands attention to the aforementioned elements for safe and efficient navigation."
