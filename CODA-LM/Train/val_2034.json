A large construction truck equipped with a conveyor belt mechanism is positioned on the right side of the ego car's lane and moving in the same direction. This truck's presence and the possibility of debris falling from its conveyor can influence the ego car's path planning and speed regulation.\n   \n2.

Such vehicles typically move slower due to their size and operational requirements. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road will require the ego car to potentially adjust speed and maintain a safe following distance to accommodate the slower pace and sudden stops that might occur during construction-related maneuvers.",

Adjusting the driving strategy to the wet road conditions is also important for maintaining vehicle control and ensuring safety."
