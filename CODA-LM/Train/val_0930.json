The presence of this truck is crucial as it heavily influences the driving decisions of the ego car. Should the truck slow down or stop, the ego car would have to react promptly to avoid a collision.\n\nEven though there are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or traffic lights in the picture that impact the autonomous vehicle's movement, the presence of construction indicators like red and white traffic cones and temporary barriers on the left side of the road is evident. These cones and barriers signal a construction zone or closed area, necessitating the ego car to stay in the proper lane to steer clear of them. Due to the absence of traffic signs, the vehicle is to adhere to general road regulations and monitor the conduct of other vehicles. The lack of visible traffic lights requires the autonomous car to remain vigilant of the road and its surroundings for further guidance on navigating safely."
