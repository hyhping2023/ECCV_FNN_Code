        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, a large truck is directly ahead of the ego car, situated within the same lane. It is a stationary or slow-moving truck characterized by its white color with red stripes. The position of the truck's rear flap, which does not suggest rapid air movement, indicates its slow pace. The proximity of the truck requires the ego car to reduce its speed and maintain a safe distance behind the truck.\n\nAn overhead blue, rectangular directional sign is visible, possibly signifying an entrance to a highway or directing certain types of vehicles to a specific lane. The symbols are not clear, but this may indicate an upcoming road junction or lane-specific directions that the ego car needs to anticipate.\n\nTo the right of the lane, a series of orange and white traffic cones are strategically placed. They define the driving lane boundary and imply that there may be roadworks or construction activities further ahead. As a result, the traffic cones serve as a directive for the ego car to stay within its lane, exercise increased caution, and avoid overtaking the truck especially on the right side.\n\nAccompanying the traffic cones, white and red striped barriers are installed on the road's right side, signaling the presence of a worksite or a no-entry zone. These barriers serve as an additional visual cue to the ego car, emphasizing the need to proceed attentively and to remain within the confines of the current driving lane."
