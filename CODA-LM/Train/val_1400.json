The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or proceed based on the SUV's actions. Additionally, there are various cars parked on the side of the road to the left, and a grey sedan is moving away from the ego car in the opposite lane. The parked cars necessitate vigilance to ensure that no doors are opened or pedestrians emerge suddenly, while the oncoming traffic needs to be monitored for potential sudden lane changes or maneuvers.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is an individual standing on the sidewalk, facing away from the street, and partially obscured by a traffic cone. Although the person is not on the road, their close proximity to the street means the ego car should remain alert to the possibility of the individual stepping onto the roadway unexpectedly.\n\nFurthermore, there are two orange-and-white traffic cones placed on the right edge of the ego car's lane. These cones suggest there might be road work or a hazard ahead, and as a result, the vehicle may need to adjust its lane position slightly to avoid them while also being ready for the presence of workers or changes in road conditions.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
