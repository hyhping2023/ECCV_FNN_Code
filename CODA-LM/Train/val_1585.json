A white SUV is present, parked on the right side of the road, facing in the same direction as our ego vehicle. Occupying this space, it represents a possible hazard; we must remain vigilant for doors that might open or pedestrians that could emerge around the car, ensuring a safe passing distance is maintained.\n\n2. Ahead on the road, a forklift is traveling in the same direction as our ego vehicle, taking up the right part of the lane. The forklift's slower pace and potential for sudden movements or stops dictate that we exercise caution, by slowing down and ensuring a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there are debris and unattended objects on the roadside, near the parked white SUV. Such obstacles can constrict the effective width of the lane, necessitating a steering adjustment from the ego vehicle to prevent mishaps.\n\nAll other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers have no objects to report in this image."

Since the road lacks clear markings, the ego car should remain vigilant for any oncoming traffic and be prepared to adjust its position within the lane to maintain safety."
