This indicates that they are stationary. The presence of these vehicles significantly narrows the available road width, necessitating careful navigation by the ego car to prevent collisions.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light displaying green can be seen in the distance ahead. This green signal grants the ego car the right to proceed, provided the pathway ahead is clear of obstacles or the interference of other road users.\n\nMoreover, there's a detection of a pile of debris or garbage bags situated on the side of the road near the parked vehicles. Such objects represent possible obstructions that could encroach upon the roadway, posing potential hazards if they were to be displaced onto the driving path.\n\nThis scene highlights the need for vigilant driving practices, especially in navigating narrow passages and observing traffic signals, while also being cautious of possible roadside hazards that could affect safe driving conditions."
