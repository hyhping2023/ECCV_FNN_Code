The car is dark in color and is potentially obstructing the right lane. This vehicle poses a risk as it could potentially start moving or open its doors, which would affect the trajectory of the ego vehicle navigating close to it on the right side. Additionally, there is a green traffic light on the right side of the road, applicable for the lane the ego vehicle is in. This green light indicates that the ego vehicle has the right of way and may proceed through the intersection without stopping. Alongside the parked car, metal guardrails are lining the right side of the road. These guardrails serve as a boundary that the ego vehicle must not cross for safety reasons, indicating a limitation on the maneuverable space available on the right side of the road. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects mentioned in the image, suggesting a relatively clear path except for the mentioned obstacles and indications."

A traffic light is a signaling device that assigns the right of way to road users by means of colored lights; typically red for stop, green for go, and yellow for caution. The presence of the traffic light indicates that the ego vehicle must obey its signals to proceed safely through the intersection or to make turns according to the light's indications. Compliance with the traffic light ensures orderly movement of traffic and prevents collisions at intersections.",
