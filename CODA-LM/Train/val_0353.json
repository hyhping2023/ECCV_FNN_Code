Additionally, there are several cars ahead in the same and adjacent lanes with visible brake lights, indicating the flow and speed of traffic that the ego car needs to follow.\n\nThere are also cyclists to the right of the road moving in the same direction as the traffic flow. These cyclists are a safety consideration as they can potentially sway into the lane or encounter issues requiring the ego car to avoid them.\n\nA blue directional sign is present, indicating a fork ahead with arrows pointing left and right. Furthermore, there is a no-entry sign for bicycles, informing about restrictions on the right side of the road that may influence cyclist behavior. \n\nOverhead traffic lights are visible, though their current state is unclear. The state of these traffic lights will dictate whether the ego car needs to stop, go, or prepare to stop once they are visible.\n\nThere are temporary traffic barriers on the right edge of the road just before a sidewalk. These barriers have reflective red and white stripes, indicating a road width restriction to protect a work zone or to manage traffic flow.\n\nAdditionally, orange and white striped barrels are present on the right side of the road. These barrels suggest preparation for traffic diversion or construction zones, requiring the ego carâ€™s attention and possibly maneuvering.\n\nOverall, the road environment includes various elements that can affect the ego car's driving strategy, all of which must be carefully monitored to ensure a safe journey."
