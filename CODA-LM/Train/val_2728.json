It is stopped under a bridge or overpass. The presence of the stopped cement truck is significant as it could impede forward movement or require the ego car to slow down and carefully maneuver around it. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. It is used for transporting concrete to various construction sites. Its large rotating drum keeps the concrete agitated and in its fluid state, ready for use at the construction site. The presence of such a vehicle on the road can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and awareness. Due to its size and the nature of its cargo, the mixer truck may move slower than typical traffic and may make unexpected stops or turns to access construction sites. Drivers in the vicinity, including the ego car, should maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential hazards such as spills or debris.",
