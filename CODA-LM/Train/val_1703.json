The truck is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. This could affect the driving behavior of the ego car as it might need to adjust its speed or change lanes to overtake the truck if it's moving slowly.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by a red traffic light visible upfront, indicating that the ego car must be ready to halt at the intersection.\n\nAdditionally, there are concrete barriers in the middle of the road dividing the opposite traffic lanes. It is crucial for the ego car to stay within its lane mindful of these barriers to ensure safety and traffic order.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects present in this scenario that need to be considered in the ego car's driving strategy."

The ego car should also monitor the truck's indicators in case it intends to turn, which would require the ego car to adjust its position accordingly."
