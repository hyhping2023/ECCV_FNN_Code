        "description and explanation": "Ahead in the same lane as the ego car, there is a cement mixer truck. This truck, distinguished by a large cylindrical mixer barrel at the back, stands out due to its significant size in comparison to a standard passenger car. The truck's position and size restrict the ego car's maneuverability and lane-changing abilities. Additionally, the truck's potential for sudden stops or a slower speed due to its heavy load necessitates maintaining a greater following distance for safety."

Its presence indicates ongoing road work or nearby construction activities. For the driver of the ego car, it is crucial to slow down and proceed with caution. There might be potential obstacles or workers near the vehicle, and sometimes such vehicles may make sudden moves or stops depending on their operation.",

Keep an eye out for opportunities to change lanes if necessary to pass the truck safely when it is safe and legal to do so."
