Firstly, there is a silver SUV directly in front of the ego car with its brake lights on, suggesting that it might be slowing down or coming to a stop. The autonomous system must therefore adjust the following distance and modify the speed of the ego car accordingly to maintain safety. Additionally, there is a red truck on the left side ahead, traveling on the opposite lane. Its presence requires the autonomous system to remain vigilant for any sudden lane changes or potential obstacles that could cause the truck to swerve, which would necessitate a quick response from the ego car.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are orange-and-white traffic cones delineating an area, which could indicate ongoing road work. The autonomous driving system must ensure that the ego car stays within the lane boundaries and be alert for any road workers or equipment that might be present in the vicinity.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
