        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are a couple of notable elements impacting the driving conditions for the ego car. Firstly, there's a truck parked on the right side of the road, partially obstructing the right lane. The presence of this truck may reduce the drivable width of the road. Consequently, it would necessitate the ego car to adjust its position, moving to the left side to bypass the truck safely, ensuring a clear and unhindered path ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there's a light blue plastic crate located on the road right next to the parked truck. This crate represents an unexpected obstacle on the roadway, further complicating the driving scenario. It requires either a lane change or a slight steering maneuver to the left by the driver to avoid a potential collision with it. This situation emphasizes the importance of constant vigilance and the ability to react promptly to unforeseen obstacles while driving."
