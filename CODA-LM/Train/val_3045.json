It is partially obstructing the view ahead and suggests ongoing or imminent roadwork, which may involve potential lane closures, detours, or areas where reduced speed is necessary. This presence may lead to traffic disruptions.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white striped traffic cones on both sides of the lane the ego car is in. These indicate a narrowing of the lane and imply that there may be roadwork or that a road section is cordoned off for safety reasons. These cones necessitate the ego car to slow down and navigate carefully, staying within the designated boundaries.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there is a traffic light displaying a red signal. This requires the ego car to come to a complete stop and wait until the signal turns green to proceed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects identified in this image."
