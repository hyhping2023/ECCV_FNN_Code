Firstly, there is a concrete mixer and a white truck positioned in the left turn lane directly facing the direction of the ego car. Both vehicles are stationary due to the red traffic light, signaling that it is currently unsafe for the ego car to proceed through the intersection. Additionally, a dark sedan is stopped at the intersection in the opposite direction, also facing the ego car and waiting for the traffic light to change, which the ego car must take into account to cross the intersection safely.\n\nFurthermore, there is a dog crossing the road from left to right in front of the ego car. The presence of the dog introduces an element of unpredictability and potential safety hazards, necessitating that the ego car either slows down or comes to a complete stop to prevent any possible collision.\n\nThe traffic light facing the ego car is red and is equipped with a countdown timer showing 66 seconds remaining. This clearly instructs the ego car to remain stationary until the light turns green, ensuring compliance with traffic rules and maintaining road safety.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
