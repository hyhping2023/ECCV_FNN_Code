Firstly, there are multiple vehicles parked on the right side of the road, along with vehicles with headlights on approaching from the opposite direction. This scenario necessitates careful maneuvering due to the narrowing of the usable road width and requires maintaining proper lane discipline to avoid collisions. Additionally, a white car is parked with its rear protruding onto the roadway on the right, forcing other vehicles to possibly move into the opposing lane to pass, posing potential hazards if not done carefully.\n\nA warning sign is visible on the right side of the road, potentially indicating a pedestrian crossing or other hazards ahead. The ego car should be prepared to slow down and yield to pedestrians or navigate around any potential hazards.\n\nBarriers, such as yellow poles or bollards, are present on the right side of the road near the parked cars. These barriers delineate the road edge and parking areas, potentially signaling no entry to a specific area or warning the driver to keep a safe distance from the side."
