It is important to note that due to the truck's size and the potential for debris from its rotating drum and chute, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and be alert to react to anything that might fall onto the road.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are several cyclists traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The proximity of the cyclists means that the ego vehicle should proceed with caution, ensuring it gives them adequate space while passing and being ready for any sudden movements they may make.\n\nIn the distance, there is a traffic light which is currently green. Although this allows the ego vehicle to continue, it must do so with awareness that the signal could change and other road users may enter the intersection.\n\nAdditionally, there are parked bicycles and mopeds on the right side of the road, near where the cyclists are located. This situation demands extra vigilance from the ego car as these parked vehicles could become obstacles if they were to fall onto the street or be moved unpredictably by a pedestrian.\n\nThis environment offers a complex scene that the ego vehicle must navigate carefully, being mindful of the large vehicle in front, the vulnerable road users alongside, and the potential changes in traffic signals and road conditions due to stationary objects."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It's characterized by its large rotating drum at the back used for mixing cement while being transported to construction sites. Given its function, the truck often moves more slowly than other vehicles due to the weight and nature of its cargo. For the future driving behavior of the ego car, it indicates the need for increased caution. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance to allow for longer stopping distances and to be prepared for potential slowing or sudden stops by the cement mixer.",

Be prepared to slow down or stop if the truck makes any sudden movements. When overtaking the cyclists, ensure to do so safely by giving them plenty of room and indicating early to alert other road users of the maneuver. Continue to monitor the traffic light for any changes and be ready to stop if it turns yellow or red. Be aware of the parked vehicles on the side of the road and anticipate any possible movements from this area that could affect the driving path."
