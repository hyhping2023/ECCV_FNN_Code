        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image described, there are primarily two categories of road users and objects that are of importance â€“ vehicles and traffic cones.\n\nStarting off with the vehicles, there are two notable ones. The first is a white bus, positioned centrally within the field of view. The bus is either stationary or moving very slowly, which is indicative of it being part of a traffic queue or at a stop. The significance of this white bus lies in its size and positioning relative to the ego vehicle. Given its substantial size, it necessitates that the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance, as it restricts the drivable path directly ahead. Moving to the left, there's a blue bus, only partially visible, situated in an adjacent lane and progressing in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of this blue bus serves as a reminder of the multiplicity of lanes on the road and underscores the importance of vigilance for potential lateral movements, especially from large vehicles like buses.\n\nSwitching focus to the traffic cones, there's an arrangement of orange cones and a yellow post on the right side of the image. Their configuration suggests that a part of the road further ahead might be obstructed, possibly due to road works or a section of the road being closed off. These cones play a crucial role in signaling potential hazards or alterations in the normal traffic pattern, signalling the need for drivers to adjust their course or speed accordingly.\n\nIn this snapshot of road life, other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, and other miscellaneous objects did not feature any items worth noting. Therefore, attention is solely on navigating around the large vehicles and heeding the warning provided by the traffic cones to ensure a safe passage through the depicted scene."
