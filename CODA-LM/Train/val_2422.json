Such vehicles are typically equipped with heavy machinery and are used in road work or construction projects. Its presence on the road usually indicates ongoing construction or maintenance work nearby. For the ego car, this means increased caution is necessary while driving. Speed reductions and adherence to temporary traffic signs or signals are expected to navigate safely past the work zone, minimizing risks of collisions or disruptions.",

Slow down and drive vigilantly to react safely to any unforeseen changes in the road conditions or traffic patterns."
