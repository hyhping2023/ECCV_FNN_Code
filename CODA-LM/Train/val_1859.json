This car poses a potential hazard if it decides to move into the lane unexpectedly.\n   - A large yellow truck is parked diagonally ahead on the right side of the road, taking up part of the lane which the ego vehicle would normally use. This could obstruct the ego vehicle's path and limit its maneuverability, necessitating a possible lane change to the left to bypass the truck.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Two individuals are present on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, engaged in maintenance or construction near some greenery. These individuals might enter the road or unintentionally create a hazard, so the ego vehicle must be cautious when passing by.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - A yellow warning sign with black symbols indicating a bump or uneven road surface is visible to the right, signaling the presence of road irregularities ahead. This advises the ego vehicle to prepare for potential impacts on control or stability due to uneven road surfaces.\n\n4. **Other Objects**:\n   - A red and white barrier blocking the entrance of a side area suggests restricted access, located on the right alongside a litter bin. The barrier points to areas not accessible to the ego vehicle, and while the litter bin is a static object by the roadside, it doesnâ€™t directly affect driving behavior but should be considered to maintain safe distancing.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in this scene that affect the driving conditions of the ego vehicle."

Following the warning sign, the vehicle should also be ready to handle any uneven road surfaces. Continuous monitoring of the oncoming car's indicators and the workers' movements is crucial. If necessary, the ego vehicle should also signal its intentions to pass the truck safely to other road users."
