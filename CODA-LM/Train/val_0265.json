        "description and explanation": "The traffic scenario depicted includes a variety of road users and objects impacting driving behavior. First, there is a white sedan directly in front of the ego vehicle, in the same lane, and traveling in the same direction. This vehicle sets the pace for the ego car, influencing its following distance and speed to ensure safe driving practices are adhered to. Additionally, a light-colored SUV is noticed in the left adjacent lane to the ego vehicle, slightly ahead and also moving in the same direction. The presence of the SUV necessitates cautious driving as it may change lanes or adjust its speed unexpectedly.\n\nFurthermore, two cyclists are observed on the far right side of the road, riding in the same direction as the traffic. Their close proximity to the road necessitates vigilant monitoring by the ego vehicle to mitigate the risk of any sudden intrusions into the traffic lane.\n\nIn terms of road obstacles, red and white traffic cones are placed on the left edge of the ego vehicle's lane, potentially signaling road work or a narrowing lane ahead. This setup suggests that the driver should keep right and may need to reduce speed. Complementarily, a white and blue guardrail is positioned on the right side of the road, delineating the boundary between the roadway and the pedestrian zone. It serves as an important navigational guide, indicating the road's edge. \n\nThis scenario lacks any distinct traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects that might further influence driving behavior or conditions."

Be vigilant of the SUV to the left, watching for any indicators or lane changes, and be ready to react. Keep an eye on the cyclists to ensure they do not enter the roadway and adjust lateral position slightly to the left if safe to do so, away from the potential hazard. Also, be mindful of the indicated lane narrowing or road work suggested by the traffic cones, and reduce speed if necessary while maintaining lane position to avoid the cones. Always be prepared to brake or maneuver if unexpected events occur. Stay in the current lane unless overtaking is required and is safe to do so."
