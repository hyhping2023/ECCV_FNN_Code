Although this pedestrian poses no immediate risk as they are not on the roadway, the ego car should remain vigilant in case the pedestrian decides to enter the roadway.\n\n- **Traffic Signs:** There are multiple traffic signs visible. A 'Do Not Enter' sign indicates a closed lane to the left, and directional arrows show a lane shift due to construction ahead on the right. The 'Do Not Enter' sign directs the ego car to avoid the closed lane, while the directional arrows guide it to stay in the correct lane.\n\n- **Traffic Lights:** A red traffic light is visible ahead in the left lane, which is closed for construction. Although this light is in the closed lane, the ego car should stay alert for any traffic signals pertaining to its own lane and be prepared to stop or adjust speed accordingly.\n\n- **Traffic Cones:** Traffic cones are positioned to indicate a lane merge or closure to the left side of the ego car. These cones signal that the ego car must remain in the open lane and be ready for potential merging traffic from the closed lane.\n\n- **Barriers:** Temporary construction barriers are on the left, separating the closed lane from the operational one. These barriers confirm that the left lane is out of use, directing the ego car to follow the open right lane.\n\n- **Other Objects:** There are no other objects present that impact the driving behavior of the ego car, indicating no need for adjustment due to unforeseen obstacles."
