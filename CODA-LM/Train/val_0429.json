Further down the road, several other vehicles are observed moving in the same direction as the ego car, adhering to the traffic flow. The ego car must stay alert to the movements of these vehicles to ensure it matches the overall traffic speed and flow.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a group of construction workers identifiable by their high-visibility jackets and standing near a traffic barricade. Their proximity to the road may affect safety conditions and suggests there could be road work or a lane closure ahead.\n\nThe traffic light visible in the scene is green, which legally permits vehicles to proceed. However, the ego car must proceed with caution due to the nearby construction workers and the possibility of changes in the road layout ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a portable traffic barricade held by construction workers, indicating that there might be a lane closure or road work on the right side of the road. This means the ego car may need to change lanes if the current lane becomes obstructed or is closed further along the road.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
