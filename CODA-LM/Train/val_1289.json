The truck occupies a significant part of the lane and appears to be traveling at a slower speed. This truck's slow speed and large size pose potential hazards. Additionally, the dim tail lights of the truck may reduce visibility for the ego car, especially in low-light conditions, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.\n\nSecondly, a traffic cone is visible on the right edge of the road. This indicates a potential hazard or ongoing road work nearby. The presence of this traffic cone suggests that drivers, including the ego car, should be cautious and prepared for possible lane narrowing or encountering obstacles along the road.\n\nLastly, there is significant glare coming from the headlights of an oncoming vehicle. This glare can obscure vision and impair the ego car's ability to see obstacles or understand road conditions ahead. Glare from headlights can temporarily blind drivers or significantly reduce visibility, which raises the risk of accidents by making it challenging to navigate the road safely.\n\nNo other categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or additional objects, are mentioned, indicating that they are not present or not significant in this traffic image."

Reduce speed to account for the limited visibility caused by the oncoming vehicle's glare and the wet road conditions. Stay alert for possible obstacles or road work indicated by the traffic cone. Consider switching lanes if it is safe and legal to do so, given the reduced visibility and potential hazards in the current lane."
