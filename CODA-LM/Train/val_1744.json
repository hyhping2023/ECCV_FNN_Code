The truck is distinguishable by its container, which bears visible identification marks. Due to the truck's size and its close proximity, the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car is significantly limited. Consequently, it is imperative for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and remain vigilant, ready to adjust its speed or change lanes if the situation necessitates. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

The cargo compartment is adorned with various shipping container codes and international maritime markings, indicating it is used for long-haul transport. This presence of the truck directly affects the driving behavior of the ego car, implying the need for cautious driving, maintaining a safe following distance, and anticipation of slower accelerations and decelerations due to the truck's larger size and mass.",

Due to the nighttime conditions, additional caution should be taken to identify any unexpected events or road users that may enter the field of vision suddenly."
