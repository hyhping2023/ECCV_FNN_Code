Firstly, a green bus is stationary at a bus stop on the right side of the road, encroaching slightly into our lane. This may cause traffic obstruction, necessitating a potential lane change or reduced speed for safe passing. Ahead, vehicles can be seen moving in the same direction as the ego car, influencing the car's speed and following distance. Additionally, a motorcycle is visible in the middle of the road ahead, moving in the same direction, which requires heightened awareness due to its vulnerability and potential for unpredictability.\n\nDirectional signs to the upper left indicate an upcoming turn or intersection, suggesting that the ego car might need to adjust its positioning or prepare for a turn. Orange and black traffic cones form a line that partially bisects the road ahead on the right, directing traffic flow away from the bus stop; this indicates that the right part of the lane is partially unusable, prompting the ego car to maneuver slightly leftwards for safety. Finally, yellow and black striped barriers on the right side of the road prevent access to an area adjacent to the bus stop, ensuring vehicles stay within the road boundaries and avoid prohibited or unsafe areas."
