The presence of these vehicles requires the ego car to exercise caution and possibly adjust its speed to maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, a right curve warning sign is present on the right side of the road, signaling an upcoming right curve and advising the ego car to reduce its speed to navigate the curve safely. There are also several information signs above the roadway on the right side. One of these signs provides lane information, while the others may offer specific instructions or guidelines. It is important for the ego car to observe and comply with the information on these signs to ensure proper lane usage and adherence to any speed limits.\n\nFurthermore, road barriers are visible ahead on the right side of the road. These barriers mark the boundary of the driving area and suggest that there may be construction or changes in the road layout. As a result, the ego car should remain within the designated driving lanes and may need to slow down in response to these road alterations."

Continued caution is advised while passing the area with barriers, in case of potential road work or altered traffic patterns."
