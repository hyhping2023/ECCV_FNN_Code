Directly ahead in the same lane, there is a white van with its red tail lights illuminated, suggesting it might be slowing down or has come to a stop. This vehicle poses a risk as it could brake suddenly or make unpredictable moves, requiring the ego car to monitor it closely.\n\nIn the adjacent right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a white sports car identifiable by its unique taillight design. The sports car's position and the possibility of it making lateral movements mean that the ego car needs to be aware of it in case it changes lanes or adjusts its speed.\n\nOn the far right side of the road, there is a cyclist equipped with reflective elements and bike lights. The cyclist is close to the roadway, which could become hazardous if they swerve or fall into the path of vehicles. Additionally, while not directly visible in the image, pedestrians are often present on sidewalks in urban settings. The ego car must be vigilant and ready to respond if pedestrians step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, a traffic light is visible in the distance displaying a green light. This indicates that the ego car is allowed to continue but should stay alert to any sudden changes and be mindful of how other road users respond to the traffic light.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
