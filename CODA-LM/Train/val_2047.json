The motorcyclist is wearing a black jacket and a white helmet. This individual is considered a vulnerable road user and could potentially change lanes or stop suddenly, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to respond accordingly. Additionally, the motorcyclist's limited protection in case of an accident necessitates that the ego car exercises careful observation and caution when in close proximity.\n\nFurthermore, there is a white vehicle in the distance traveling in the opposite direction. Although this vehicle does not immediately affect the ego car's path, it is still important to remain aware of oncoming traffic when making driving decisions.\n\nDirectly ahead of the ego car, a traffic light is displaying a green light. This indicates that the ego car has the right of way to proceed through the intersection, provided it is safe to do so.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are barriers covered with green and blue tarps, which likely signify ongoing construction or road work. As a result, the ego car may need to adjust its lane position if the road width is affected or if there are additional traffic signs or signals directing traffic."
