        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scenario, there are a couple of road users and obstacles influencing the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle (ego car).\n\nFirstly, vehicles identified in the scene include a black sedan positioned directly ahead in the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. It is crucial for the ego car to ensure it maintains a safe following distance from this sedan to avoid any potential collision. Additionally, there is a yellow maintenance truck in the left lane ahead of the ego car that appears to be stationary and features visible signage. The ego car should be cautious by preparing to slow down or stop if necessary and should refrain from overtaking unless it is clear and safe to do so in the right lane.\n\nAnother key element in this traffic image is the presence of multiple orange traffic cones. These cones are placed along the left lane, starting from the middle of the image and extending towards the maintenance truck, indicating a lane closure. This setup advises the ego car to continue in the right lane, exercise caution, and avoid entering the closed left lane to ensure safe navigation through the area.\n\nThe image does not include any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that might affect driving decisions in this particular observation."

The cone's bright orange color and white reflective stripes are designed to be highly visible to drivers, serving as a dummy to ensure drivers move away from potential risks or change lanes safely. This should motivate the driver of the ego car to remain alert and possibly adjust their driving path to avoid the marked area around the cone.",
