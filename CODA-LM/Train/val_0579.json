Firstly, there are traffic signs present; one is a blue rectangular sign with white text and an arrow pointing left, indicating a detour or alternative route to the left. This sign is accompanied by a no-entry sign, which prohibits vehicles from proceeding straight ahead in that lane. \n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian traffic light visible on the near side of the intersection, displaying a red standing person icon. This indicates that pedestrians are not allowed to cross the street, and drivers should be cautious of pedestrians who may be waiting or attempting to cross.\n\nFurthermore, the road ahead appears to be closed, as evidenced by a series of metal barriers followed by a green construction fence that extends across an intersection. This obstruction signifies that vehicles must take an alternative route as indicated by the detour signs.\n\nLastly, there are orange traffic cones placed alongside the metal barriers at the edge of the road. One cone is notably positioned slightly into the roadway, emphasizing the closed area and potentially reducing the width of the usable lane, which requires drivers to proceed with caution. \n\nThere are no vehicles, vulnerable road users, or additional traffic cones listed in the JSON data for this image."
