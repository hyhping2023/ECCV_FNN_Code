        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a heavy truck immediately in front of the ego car. It appears either stationary or moving slowly and has visible cargo on the back. The presence of this truck is significant because it occupies considerable space on the roadway and may block the driver's view of the road ahead. As a result, the driver must proceed with caution and ensure a safe distance is kept from the truck to account for any sudden stops or changes in the truck's movement.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow diamond-shaped traffic sign with a black symbol indicating an intersection ahead situated on the right side of the road. This sign warns the ego car's driver that there's an upcoming junction where another road merges from the right, signaling that the driver should be vigilant for vehicles that might enter the road unexpectedly.\n\nMoreover, orange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the ego vehicle's lane. The placement of these cones indicates that there could be roadwork or an obstruction ahead, signaling that the driver might need to merge to the right or reduce speed to safely navigate past the narrowed road space.\n\nOther categories including vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects had no entries, which means there are no such obstacles or road users present in this traffic scene."
