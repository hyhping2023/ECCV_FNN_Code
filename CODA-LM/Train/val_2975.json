The construction vehicle poses a potential obstruction and could impact the ego car's path, requiring caution and possibly a change of route or lane. The parked van does not directly obstruct the road, but the ego car should be aware of its presence and the possibility of it entering the lane unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there are metal barriers or fencing along the side of the road. These barriers separate the road from pedestrian areas and help define the boundaries of the drivable space for the ego car.\n\nLastly, there are bare trees lining the street. While these trees do not directly impact driving, their presence should be noted for potential obstacles or visibility issues."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, possibly a mobile crane, based on its distinctive upper structure featuring a rotating platform, control cabin, and heavy-duty hydraulic machinery. These types of vehicles are commonly used in public works and construction projects for lifting and moving heavy items. In the context of the driving scenario, the presence of the construction vehicle suggests that there may be ongoing construction or road work ahead. This could affect future driving behavior by necessitating changes in lanes or speed to accommodate road conditions and ensure safety around the construction site.",
