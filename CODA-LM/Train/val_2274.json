        "description and explanation": "In the image, there is a variety of road users and signs. There is a yellow crane truck on the road's right side, its arm extended outward, encroaching on the ego car's lane. This arm creates a hazard to the ego car's path, likely necessitating a change to another lane to avoid it. Additionally, there are multiple cars in the same lane ahead of the ego car that determines the speed and distance that our car should maintain. A white vehicle is also spotted on the left lane, facing the opposite direction, which appears to be parked. Although it does not affect the ego car's immediate movement, it is essential to keep an eye on it should it enter the flow of traffic.\n\nAs for road signs, there's a \"No left turn\" sign on the road's right, informing that left turns are not permitted going forward. This will influence the ego car's routing decision, ensuring it plans a different maneuver if needed. No other road users, traffic lights, cones, barriers, or objects are noted in the image."

Due to its size and function, it is likely involved in heavy lifting and construction tasks. In a traffic scenario, the presence of such a vehicle may indicate nearby construction activity necessitating caution and potentially slower speeds from passing drivers. It could also lead to traffic congestion or temporary lane closures, requiring the ego car to adjust its route or driving strategy accordingly.",

No immediate action is required in response to the parked white vehicle on the left but the situation should continue to be monitored in case the vehicle's status changes."
