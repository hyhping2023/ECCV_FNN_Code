They seem to be marking a road closure or a diversion, signaling that the path straight ahead is inaccessible. Complementing these cones are metal barriers arrayed across the road beside them, acting as a physical deterrent to prevent vehicles from continuing directly on this path. This setup suggests a need for drivers to find alternate routes. No vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are observed in this specific frame, highlighting the sole focus on road alterations and obstructions."

Traffic barriers are usually placed to restrict access to certain areas or to safely guide vehicles through a temporary route change or construction site. For the ego car in this scenario, encountering this barrier means that it must stop or divert its path according to the indicated road changes.
