However, there are orange traffic cones with reflective stripes lined up on the right side of the road, which suggest that there is a closed lane or area ahead, likely due to construction or a roadblock. This means that the road ahead is not accessible for driving. Furthermore, there is a yellow and black striped barrier gate positioned horizontally across the road, indicating that the road is completely closed for entry and vehicles are unable to pass through. There are no other objects in the scene that affect driving behavior."
