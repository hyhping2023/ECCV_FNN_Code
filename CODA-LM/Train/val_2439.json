This positioning and orientation of the van imply that it may be attempting to merge back into the lane, potentially affecting the trajectory or path of the ego vehicle. \n\nSimultaneously, a silver car occupies the left lane, positioned directly adjacent to the ego vehicle's path and traveling in the same direction. The silver car's proximity could limit the ego car's options for maneuvering or changing lanes to the left, indicating a restricted movement area for the ego vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, bright orange traffic cones are observed forming a boundary on the right side of the road. These cones lead up to and surround the white van, indicating a work zone or road hazard that necessitates vehicles, including the ego car, to shift to the left, away from the obstruction.\n\nFurther down the road, red and white striped barriers are visible on the right side, beyond the traffic cones. These barriers likely signify an extended area of road work or indicate a closure, emphasizing the importance of maintaining lane discipline and the requirement for vehicles to stay to the left due to the right lane being obstructed or entirely closed for traffic.\n\nThe observed scene lacks vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other objects, suggesting a primary focus on vehicular movement and the immediate roadwork-related obstructions and their influence on the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
