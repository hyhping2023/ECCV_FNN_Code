Motorcyclists are less stable and more vulnerable than four-wheeled vehicles, which means the ego car should maintain a safe distance and exercise caution when considering overtaking or lane-changing maneuvers.\n\nOverhead directional signs are indicating lanes for going straight and turning, with additional road information signs adjacent to the traffic lights. These signs are crucial for navigation and lane selection, ensuring that the ego car is in the correct lane for its intended route.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic light in the red phase is visible for the lane the ego car is in, as well as for the adjacent lanes. This red light requires the ego car to come to a complete stop and wait for the green phase before it can proceed.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
