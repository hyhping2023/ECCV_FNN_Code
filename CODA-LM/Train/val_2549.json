To the immediate left and slightly ahead in the adjacent lane, there is a black sedan. The presence of this sedan is important as it may affect the ego car's ability to merge or change lanes to the left. Additionally, there is a white sedan in the right lane, positioned parallel to the ego vehicle with both vehicles' fronts aligned. The ego car must maintain its current lane and ensure a safe following distance due to the closeness of the white sedan. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene."
