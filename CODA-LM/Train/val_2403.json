The first is a silver car, positioned away from the ego car, stationary on the curb. It does not pose an immediate threat to the ego car's path; however, caution is required as the situation around the parked car could change unexpectedly, such as doors opening or pedestrians potentially emerging from behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there's a white vehicle parked ahead, also on the right side and facing away from the ego car. Similar to the silver car, this vehicle is not directly affecting traffic flow at the moment but should be kept under observation for any sudden movements or activity.\n\nA vulnerable road user is visible, specifically a person is in the process of exiting a dark-colored vehicle on the right. The rear passenger side car door is open, encroaching into the roadway. This poses a risk that warrants attention, as the individual may step further into the lane of the ego car, or the door could be closed abruptly, necessitating readiness to adjust the ego car's trajectory or speed accordingly.\n\nNone of the other categories, such as traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, have been reported in the scene, indicating the absence of these elements in the visual field."
