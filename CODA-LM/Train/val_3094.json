Nearby, construction workers are present, which calls for a reduction in speed and heightened awareness to ensure their safety and to prevent sudden movements. Temporary traffic control signs close to the bus indicate changes in normal flow due to construction and stress the need to pay attention to traffic rule alterations like speed limits or lane utilization. Additionally, bright orange traffic cones have been placed around the construction zone to direct vehicles away from the area to protect the workers, marking it as a space the ego vehicle should not enter. There are no traffic lights, barriers, or other objects highlighted in this scene."

It is typically used to alert drivers of potential hazards or changes in road conditions ahead, ensuring that vehicles slow down or are redirected away from the affected area. In this scenario, the presence of the barrier indicates that the ego car must be prepared to modify its route or speed to safely navigate through the area, considering the adjustments in usual traffic flow and perhaps a reduction in available lanes.",

Given the activities around the construction site and the bus's position, the ego car should be ready to use the left lane to pass the obstruction while ensuring it is safe and legal to do so. Constant monitoring of workers' movements and potential updates from the temporary traffic signs should guide the driving behavior throughout this stretch."
