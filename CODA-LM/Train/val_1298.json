When approaching or passing by this car, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential hazards such as opening doors or the parked car suddenly entering the traffic flow. Adequate space should be given to handle any unpredictable movements, and the ego car might need to reduce speed depending on road, traffic conditions, and visibility at night.",

The ego car must ensure it maintains a safe distance from the parked car to avoid any collision, especially since the visibility might be compromised due to the low light conditions.
