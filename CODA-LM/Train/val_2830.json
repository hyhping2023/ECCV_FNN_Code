One is a white sedan on the left side, in the same lane as the ego vehicle but facing the opposite direction. It is currently stopped, posing no immediate dynamic threat, though vigilance is required for potential movement. Additionally, a yellow taxi on the right side, facing the same direction as the ego car but on the opposite side of the road, is observed. While the taxi doesn't currently influence the ego vehicle's path, cautiousness is advised for unforeseeable lane changes or stops.\n\nThe image also shows multiple pedestrians around a construction area near a crane, potentially affecting the driving behavior as the pedestrians are close to the driving path. It necessitates reduced speed and readiness to stop by the ego vehicle.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a parking sign on the left indicating a nearby parking area, and a blue traffic sign directly in front of the ego car indicating a detour or altered traffic flow. While the parking sign has minor immediate effect, it shows potential pedestrian or vehicle activity nearby. The blue sign indicates changes ahead in the road layout or conditions, necessitating careful driving and possibly a route change.\n\nOrange traffic cones line up from the middle towards the right of the image, demarcating a construction zone and indicating a lane or part of the road closure which will require a lane change or driving adjustment.\n\nFurthermore, temporary barriers around the construction zone marked by the cones are visible, delineating the construction area. It is vital for the ego vehicle to maintain distance for safety and compliance with road rules.\n\nLastly, a significant obstacle is presented by a crane positioned on the road, taking up several lanes and mainly contributing to the road obstruction. This demands a cautious approach from the ego vehicle and might require a detour due to the crane's presence.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in this scenario to report."
