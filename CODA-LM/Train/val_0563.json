These pedestrians are occupying the side of the road and could potentially enter the road, necessitating vigilance from the ego vehicle and preparedness to stop if necessary.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: A blue circular sign with a white arrow indicates to keep right, with a red and white striped panel beneath it. This sign shows that the road ahead narrows and traffic should keep to the right, dictating the driving path for the ego vehicle.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: Red and white traffic poles with reflective bands are positioned on the right side of the road, narrowing the lane. These poles mark the boundary of the drivable area and highlight the need for extra caution to avoid collisions.\n\n- **Barriers**: A low concrete or stone barrier is present on the right side of the road, defining the edge of the roadway and any drivable area. As the road narrows, the ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance from this barrier.\n\nNo traffic lights or other objects were noted in the image."

Bollards are often used to ensure that vehicles keep to particular sections of the road and to protect pedestrian areas. In this case, the bollard influences the driving behavior by ensuring that vehicles do not drive over or into the designated pedestrian zone alongside the curb. This compels the driver of the ego car to maintain their lane and not veer towards the edge of the road where pedestrians are present.",
