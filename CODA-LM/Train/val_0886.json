Firstly, the vehicles present include a silver SUV that is double-parked on the right side, effectively blocking the right lane and necessitating a merge to the left for the ego car to pass. Additionally, there is a white sedan positioned ahead in the center lane, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. A dark-colored sedan is also noted ahead in the left lane, with the potential for unexpected lane changes or deceleration, warranting close observation by the ego car. Furthermore, various other vehicles are scattered throughout all lanes ahead, creating a complex driving environment that demands constant vigilance.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a person pushing a cart across the street from the right, obstructing the right lane. This individual poses a significant safety risk, compelling the ego car to either stop or slow down significantly to avoid a collision.\n\nRegarding traffic lights, the image does not provide visibility of any traffic lights. This absence means that the ego car must depend on the flow of traffic and any road signs present for navigational cues, as the usual guidance from traffic lights is unavailable.\n\nThe data does not include any traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, indicating that these elements are either not present in the image or not relevant to the driving scenario at hand."
