Directly in front of the ego car is an open hatchback with its cargo visible and brake lights on, signaling that it may be stopped or slowing down due to traffic congestion or an obstruction. Additionally, a white van is situated in the next lane to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead. Its position and potential movement are important as they could influence the ego car's ability to safely change lanes. \n\nOn the road itself, a green railing runs along the roadside, marking the edge of the drivable area and separating the road from an adjacent vegetation zone. The presence of this barrier constrains the lateral movement of the ego car on that side. \n\nFurthermore, the image shows raindrops on the windshield, indicating that it's raining. The rainfall reduces visibility and affects the road's grip, which requires the ego car to travel at reduced speeds and with greater caution.\n\nThe image does not contain vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or traffic cones, meaning these categories are not present and do not impact the driving environment in this scenario."
