The truck appears either stationary or moving slowly, which partially obscures the view ahead for the ego car. Due to this obstruction, the ego car needs to be ready to decelerate or come to a stop to avoid potential collisions and remain vigilant for other road users or obstacles that may suddenly emerge from behind or around the truck.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian has been spotted close to the road's edge on the right side, ahead of the ego car. The pedestrian appears distracted, as their attention is not on the traffic, raising the likelihood of an unexpected entry onto the road. Consequently, the ego car should be prepared to reduce speed or stop to mitigate the risk posed by the pedestrian and ensure their safety.\n\nMoreover, there is a traffic sign that is not clearly visible due to the presence of the truck. The obscured sign might carry essential details regarding the road conditions that lie ahead. Without clear visibility of this sign, the ego car is advised to proceed with increased caution, especially when passing near the truck and the pedestrian.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in this image, indicating they do not influence the driving behavior in this situation."
