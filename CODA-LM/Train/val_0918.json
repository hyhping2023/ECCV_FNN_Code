Ahead of the ego car, there are several cars driving in the same direction and on the right side, indicating the flow of traffic. The ego car should maintain a safe distance behind these cars.\n\nAbove the road in the middle of the image, directional signs are visible, providing guidance on lane directions and upcoming junctions or exits. These signs are crucial for the ego car to determine the correct lane for following the desired route. To the right of the blue truck, there is a traffic light currently showing green, which permits the vehicles in front of the ego car, as well as the ego car itself, to proceed.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car, orange and white traffic cones are lined up, demarcating work zones or changes in lane configurations. These cones suggest that the ego car should stay to the left to avoid the constricted area. Additionally, yellow and black striped barriers are placed at the edge of the roadwork area on the right side, signaling the boundaries of the construction zone and restricting entry.\n\nThere are also several construction-related objects and equipment, such as a crane and a truck with a hydraulic platform on the left side of the image, suggesting ongoing work. The presence of this construction equipment indicates the potential for workers on the road and the possibility of unexpected obstructions."
