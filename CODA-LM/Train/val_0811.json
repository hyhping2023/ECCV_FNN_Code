            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone positioned on the edge of a roadway under construction. It is typically bright orange with a reflective stripe, designed to be highly visible, even during low light conditions. Traffic cones are used as temporary markers to guide vehicles and indicate where drivers need to avoid specific areas due to hazards or road work. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests the driver must stay clear of the designated area, directing traffic flow safely around the construction zone, which can influence the driver to reduce speed and proceed with caution.",

The presence of this cone in the driving scenario suggests that part of the road may be closed or under maintenance, requiring the ego vehicle to potentially reduce speed and maneuver carefully to avoid the indicated area. The color and material of the cone make it visible during various conditions, promoting safer navigation around the temporary obstacle.",

Additionally, be vigilant for any road work signs, changes in traffic patterns, or instructions from construction zone flaggers. The ego vehicle should remain in the lane, respecting the traffic cones and barrier, and pass the construction zone with caution. If the next section of the road after the van is not visible, the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or maneuver as new situations arise."
