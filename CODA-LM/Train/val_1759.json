This represents a potential hazard for the autonomous vehicle as the construction vehicle might be moving slowly, may stop unexpectedly, or its operator might not be aware of the autonomous vehicle's presence, requiring careful monitoring and possibly adaptive driving behavior from the autonomous system. There are no other road users such as vulnerable road users, no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects to consider in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a construction vehicle, specifically it appears to be a yellow heavy-duty machinery often used in construction or maintenance tasks. The positioning of the vehicle in the middle of the road can significantly influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating a reduction in speed and increased attention. The driver might need to stop or navigate around the construction vehicle cautiously, maintaining a safe distance. Additionally, the presence of such a vehicle could indicate ongoing construction or road work ahead, prompting the driver to watch for sudden changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles.",
