This truck could hinder visibility and presents a risk if its load is not secure.\n- A white SUV is on the right side of the road, traveling in the same direction. The SUV may merge or change lanes, a maneuver the ego car needs to anticipate.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users:\n- A cyclist is positioned on the left side of the ego car, close to the road's edge. The proximity of the cyclist could pose a danger if there are unexpected maneuvers.\n- A motorcyclist is on the right, further away, also moving in the same direction as the ego car. This motorcyclist could change lanes or adjust speed, necessitating close monitoring by the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic sign is observed:\n- A speed limit sign on the right side of the road imposes a maximum speed of 40 km/h, a limit the ego car must follow for legal and safety reasons.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

    "driving_suggestion": "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck, taking into account the potential for falling debris. It is also advisable to be prepared to slow down or stop if the truck's load appears unstable. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the SUV for any intentions of lane changing or merging, while also maintaining a watchful eye on the cyclist and motorcyclist and be ready to react to their possible movements. All the while, the vehicle should observe the 40 km/h speed limit as indicated by the road sign."
