        "description and explanation": "The observed traffic scene is comprised of several road users and objects, categorized into vehicles, vulnerable road users, and traffic cones.\n\nIn the vehicles category, there are two groups noted. The first is a white sedan, positioned right ahead of the ego vehicle in the right lane and moving in the same direction. The significance of this sedan is that it may slow down, stop suddenly, or change lanes, actions which would necessitate that the ego vehicle react promptly to avoid a collision. The second group comprises multiple cars parked on the side of the road on the right. These cars are stationary and present a hazard as they reduce the available road width and could obscure pedestrians or other road users trying to exit from between the parked cars.\n\nObservations on vulnerable road users reveal two individuals: a cyclist and a pedestrian. The cyclist is riding in the same direction as the ego vehicle, occupying the center of the right lane, which requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance and potentially change lanes for a safe pass. The pedestrian is seen standing stationary on the sidewalk to the left, implying a need for continuous monitoring in case they decide to cross the road, forcing the ego vehicle to slow down or stop.\n\nThe only other object noted in the scene is a stack of grey traffic blocks positioned on the sidewalk to the right. These blocks are stationary and, while not directly on the road, indicate possible nearby construction or road work. This suggests that there might be changes in road conditions or the behavior of other road users due to the construction or roadwork.\n\nThere were no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other miscellaneous objects observed in this traffic scene."
