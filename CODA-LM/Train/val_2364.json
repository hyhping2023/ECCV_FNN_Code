The first vehicle is partially on the roadway, while the second is further off to the side, at a greater distance from the ego vehicle. These vehicles obstruct the roadway and might reduce the available lanes, necessitating careful navigation around them.

The presence of this type of heavy machinery on or near the road usually signals ongoing construction or road work. For the ego car, this means there could be potential disruptions in normal traffic flow, such as reduced lanes, detours, or temporary traffic signals.

It is designed for moving or loading large amounts of earth, sand, and other materials. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates active construction work nearby, possibly leading to traffic delays or detours. Drivers, including the ego vehicle, should be prepared to slow down, follow any temporary traffic signs, and possibly take alternative routes if the road is obstructed. Additionally, the construction vehicle may make sudden movements, so maintaining a safe distance is crucial for safety.",
