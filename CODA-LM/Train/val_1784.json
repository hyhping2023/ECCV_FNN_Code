A red car is directly in front of the ego car within the same lane, with its brake lights on, suggesting it is slowing down or coming to a stop. This situation requires the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain an adequate distance to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian positioned on the right edge of the road, appearing to stand or walk near some traffic cones. The presence of a pedestrian close to the driving lane necessitates cautious driving to prepare for any potential movement into the lane.\n\nA series of traffic cones is observed on the right side of the road, hinting at a possible construction zone or a road closure. These cones may reduce the available driving space, prompting the ego car to alter its lane position accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, a barrier is located along the right side of the road, running parallel to the traffic cones. This barrier marks the boundary of the vehicleâ€™s path and may signal areas that are unavailable for driving or pedestrian access, asserting the need for spatial awareness.\n\nThe scene does not feature any traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects that could influence driving behavior, focusing instead on the previously mentioned road users and objects."
