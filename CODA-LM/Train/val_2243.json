This vehicle's movements may influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior and decisions about changing lanes or adjusting speed.\n  - A yellow taxi is moving parallel to the ego vehicle on the rightmost side of the road. This taxi may change lanes, slow down to pick up passengers, or perform other maneuvers, necessitating attentiveness and possible adjustments by the ego vehicle.\n  - Behind a barrier on the right side of the road, there is a stationary construction vehicle. Although it is not an immediate obstacle, its presence indicates potential road work ahead that might affect traffic flow, requiring the ego vehicle to reduce speed or change lanes.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - A partially obscured blue traffic sign with white lettering is located on the right side of the road. The exact contents are not visible, but the color and shape suggest it might provide important information about road conditions or directions, relevant for routing decisions.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**:\n  - Pink and white traffic cones are arranged in a row, blocking off the rightmost lane on the right side of the road. These cones demarcate a closed-off area, likely due to construction or maintenance, indicating that the ego vehicle must remain in the current lane and proceed with caution.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - A series of pink barriers are present on the right side of the road, indicating that a section of the road is closed off. These barriers are guiding traffic and preventing entry into the construction zone, requiring the ego vehicle to stay in the left lanes."
