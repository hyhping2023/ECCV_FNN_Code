There is a blue and white bus parked on the right side of the ego car's lane, with the rear visible to the ego car. This parked bus may obstruct the lane, necessitating a lane change to the left for the ego car to pass safely. A yellow van is also seen ahead on the right side, moving in the same direction as the ego car. This van may slow down or stop to park, requiring the ego car to remain vigilant and potentially change lanes. Additionally, several vehicles, including buses and trucks, are visible in the distance ahead in the same lane, potentially influencing traffic flow and necessitating the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes.\n\nMoreover, a person in camouflage clothing is standing by the roadside near a traffic cone. This presence suggests potential road work or activity, indicating that the ego car should slow down and proceed with caution. Corresponding to this, an orange traffic cone is situated near the person by the roadside on the right, marking a potential hazard or road work area. This signals the ego car to reduce speed and prepare for necessary maneuvers."
