        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects of interest. Firstly, there is a school bus ahead of the ego vehicle, identifiable by its illuminated rear lights. The position of the school bus suggests that it may be in the process of loading or unloading passengers, which necessitates extra caution from the ego vehicle to ensure safety. Additionally, there is a car with its headlights on, traveling in the opposite direction on the same road. Although this oncoming vehicle is not a direct threat, it is important for the ego vehicle to keep an eye on it to ensure safe passing.\n\nFurthermore, there is a large overhead traffic sign that provides directional and distance information. This sign does not require the ego vehicle to take any immediate action but is helpful for understanding the road layout and planning for upcoming destinations.\n\nLastly, the image includes a large graffiti marking on a nearby surface. The graffiti does not have a direct impact on driving behavior, but it could suggest the presence of pedestrians or other potential hazards in the vicinity. Therefore, the ego vehicle should remain vigilant and be prepared for unexpected situations that may arise in such an area."

This particular bus is traveling along the road and prominently occupies the lane ahead of the ego car. Ego cars driving actions must account for the slower speeds and more predictable paths of buses, especially when they stop frequently to pick up or drop off passengers, requiring additional caution and readiness to slow down or stop. Furthermore, overtaking a bus should be done with high caution, ensuring there's enough space for a safe maneuver.",
