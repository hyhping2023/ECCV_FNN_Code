This requires the driver of the ego car to carefully navigate around the vehicle to avoid any possible hazards. Additionally, there is an individual standing close to the stopped car, just inside the roadway. This person appears to be paying attention to the stopped car, potentially unaware of incoming traffic, which increases the risk of an accident.\n\nBehind the stopped car, a red traffic cone has been placed, signaling that there is a temporary roadside situation that other drivers need to be alert to. However, the cone doesn't provide a clear detour path or any specific instructions, necessitating a higher level of caution from passing drivers.\n\nFurthermore, a metal barrier is present on the left side of the lane, delineating the separation between opposing directions of traffic. The presence of the barrier limits the space available for the ego vehicle to maneuver around the stopped car, presenting a challenge for safe passage in the current driving scenario."
