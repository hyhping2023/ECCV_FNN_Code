This type of vehicle is typically used for heavy tasks related to construction such as moving large quantities of earth, laying down pavement, or other heavy-duty tasks. The presence of a construction vehicle requires the ego car to possibly adjust speed and exercise increased caution. There may be construction workers around, altered road layouts, or temporary road signs nearby, all of which impact the driving behavior by enforcing lower speed limits and enhanced attentiveness.",

The presence of this vehicle on the road is an indicator of either ongoing or upcoming construction work. For the ego car, encountering this construction vehicle means there may be possible delays or detours ahead. The ego car's driver must be cautious and alert for potential directional signs or construction workers directing traffic, adjust speed appropriately, and possibly prepare for an alternative route if the road is partially or fully blocked.",

In case the traffic light is red or not functioning, the ego vehicle should come to a stop at the intersection and follow standard traffic rules before proceeding."
