The presence of the cement truck could limit the ego carâ€™s forward visibility and maneuverability, and it may act unpredictably by starting, stopping, or turning, which requires close monitoring. Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road, including a partially visible white car and other vehicles showing their rear ends. These parked vehicles may hinder the visibility of the road ahead and any potential pedestrians that could emerge between them. The ego car must be alert for any doors opening or movement indicating a vehicle might pull out into traffic.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are pedestrians, one closer to the stationary vehicles, with a blurred motion effect suggesting movement. These moving pedestrians near the roadside could potentially enter the road, requiring caution and preparedness to stop or slow down. There is also a cyclist on the right-hand side, ahead of the parked cars, sharing the road with vehicular traffic. The cyclist is a vulnerable road user, therefore, the ego car needs to maintain a safe passing distance and remain vigilant for any changes in the cyclist's direction or speed.\n\nLastly, there are small roadside signs with red and green characters and symbols on them, located to the center-right of the image. These signs, while not directly affecting traffic behavior, are part of the roadside infrastructure. They may indicate businesses or services and can potentially be a distraction or blockage if they are not securely positioned."
