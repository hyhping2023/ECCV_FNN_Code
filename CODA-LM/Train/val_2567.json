This situation necessitates caution because the oncoming car could potentially pose a risk of collision if not given enough space and clearance to pass safely. Additionally, traffic lights are visible in the distance, comprising one red and one green light. These lights play a crucial role in signaling whether the ego vehicle should stop or proceed at the upcoming intersection, guiding the driver's actions to ensure safety and compliance with traffic rules. Other road user categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not feature in this scene, indicating a relatively straightforward driving context with primary attention to the oncoming vehicle and the traffic lights."
