This vehicle could potentially change lanes or slow down for traffic lights, impacting the driving decisions of the ego vehicle.\n   - Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a yellow and red flatbed truck occupying the same lane and oriented in the same direction. The truck's size may obscure the road conditions beyond it, necessitating readiness for sudden stops or speed variations.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - Traffic lights visible ahead display a red light, indicating that vehicles, including the ego vehicle and those in front, are required to stop."
