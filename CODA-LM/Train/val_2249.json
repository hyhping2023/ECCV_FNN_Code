This includes the absence of vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and any other miscellaneous objects. Essentially, the scene appears to be completely clear of any elements that might typically influence or affect the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle."

As a small two-wheeled vehicle, mopeds generally have a compact frame and are powered either by a small engine or an electric motor. In a driving scenario, the presence of a moped at the roadside necessitates caution from the driver of the ego car. Since mopeds are often used for short trips and can start moving unexpectedly, the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the moped begins to move into traffic.",

Garbage piles can vary widely in size and contents, often containing bags, discarded household items, and other debris. In terms of driving behavior, the presence of garbage on the road can pose potential hazards. Drivers should be vigilant for any stray items that might be on or near the roadway, which could lead to obstructions or necessitate evasive maneuvers. Additionally, maintenance or garbage collection vehicles might stop nearby to manage the garbage, requiring passing drivers to slow down or stop.",

Remain vigilant for any unexpected movements from the debris, which could indicate the presence of a small animal or other hidden hazard."
