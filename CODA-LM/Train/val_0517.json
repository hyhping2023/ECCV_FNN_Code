While this vehicle does not directly impact immediate decisions, situational awareness is required due to its presence on the opposite lane.\n    - Multiple vehicles, including sedans and SUVs, are ahead in the same lane as the ego car, indicating slow traffic or a traffic jam. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or stop.\n    - A white bus is on the right lane parallel to the ego car and moving in the same direction. The bus may make frequent stops, which could require the ego car to be vigilant and possibly change lanes if the bus stops.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs:**\n    - A green directional sign is overhead on the far side of the intersection. This sign provides route information and is not an immediate concern for driving behavior.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights:**\n    - A traffic light ahead is displaying a green signal, permitting the ego car to proceed. However, the ego car should be ready to react to any changes in the traffic light and movements of other vehicles.\n\n4. **Traffic Cones:**\n    - Orange traffic cones are arranged in a row segregating the construction area on the left side. These cones indicate road work or an obstruction, guiding vehicles to avoid the affected lane.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects are noted in the provided data."

            "description and explanation": "This is a traffic cone, typically made of a flexible plastic material with a bright orange coloration and often featuring a reflective strip. Traffic cones are utilized in road scenarios to mark areas that are undergoing maintenance, to redirect traffic flow away from potential hazards, or to indicate temporary traffic paths during road works or accidents. Positioned as it is on the roadway, this cone dictates that the ego car and all other vehicles should steer clear of the lane or part of the lane immediately adjacent to where the cone is placed to ensure safe passage around the potential hazard or construction zone, leading to modifications in lane usage and driving behavior.",

Buses play a crucial role in the public transportation systems of cities, helping to reduce traffic congestion and pollution by minimizing the number of individual vehicles on the road. Seeing a bus on the road, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and prepare for potential stops at designated bus stops, where passengers are likely to disembark or board. This necessitates increased awareness from the driver, especially in lanes dedicated or commonly used by buses, and might involve adjusting speed or changing lanes to accommodate the bus's movements and stops.",

With the green traffic light, there's currently no need to stop, but monitor it in case it changes to yellow as the intersection approaches. Drive cautiously, respecting the traffic signs and maintaining safe distances from other vehicles."
