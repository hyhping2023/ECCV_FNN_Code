In this driving scenario, the presence of a construction vehicle suggests potential construction activity ahead or nearby. The ego car should maintain increased vigilance for sudden stops or detours, erratic movement from the vehicle, or the presence of construction workers and debris in the vicinity. Drivers should be prepared to reduce speed and follow any posted construction traffic signs or instructions from roadway flaggers.

Positioned typically to protect pedestrians, control traffic flow, or deter vehicular access to certain areas, bollards can be permanent or temporary installations. For the ego car, the presence of a bollard could necessitate cautious driving, especially when maneuvering near or around these barriers. The ego car must ensure not to collide with the bollard, as they are often made of sturdy materials capable of damaging vehicles. It can be critical for the ego car to observe lane divisions or access restrictions indicated by these bollards.",

Since it's night and visibility is reduced, proceed with caution, reducing speed if necessary to respond to any unforeseen actions from the parked vehicles or sudden appearance of traffic control devices not yet visible."
