Additionally, scooters and motorcycles are parked on the right side of the street, posing a hindrance if any of them start to move into traffic.

Cyclists and motorcyclists are present in the driving lane, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from these more vulnerable road users.\n\nThe only traffic signs visible are overhead directional signs and a street name sign, which provide navigation information but do not directly affect immediate driving behavior.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving conditions."
