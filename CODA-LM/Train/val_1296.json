This pedestrian's unexpected presence on the road significantly increases the risk of a collision and necessitates immediate action from the ego vehicle. Additionally, there is a parking sign on the right side of the road, indicating a designated parking area. While this sign does not directly impact driving behavior, it serves as an environmental cue that there may be parked cars or pedestrians moving to and from these vehicles. Furthermore, the traffic lights ahead are not clearly visible and seem to be non-illuminated, suggesting either a low-traffic intersection or a non-functioning traffic signal. This uncertainty requires the ego vehicle to approach the intersection with caution."

Additionally, the ego vehicle should approach the intersection cautiously due to the indeterminate status of the traffic lights and be ready to yield to any cross traffic or follow standard protocol for a non-functioning traffic signal."
