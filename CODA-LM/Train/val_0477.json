The ego vehicle must keep a safe distance and stop behind this car as dictated by the traffic light.\n\nTo the left of the ego car, a cyclist, wearing a safety helmet and riding a blue bicycle, is crossing the intersection from left to right. The cyclist could potentially move across the path of the ego car, thus requiring careful monitoring to prevent a possible collision.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, there are pedestrians within a crosswalk: an adult walking with two children and another individual carrying items, all moving parallel to the ego vehicle. These pedestrians might affect the ego car's decision-making if they choose to cross the road.\n\nA person on a scooter is present on the far-left side of the scene, in motion but not currently in the path of the ego car's direction of travel. While not an immediate concern, the scooter's trajectory should be kept under watch.\n\nAdditionally, there is a No parking sign on the right side of the road conveying parking restrictions. This does not affect immediate driving decisions, but is important information regarding parking rules.\n\nThe traffic lights situated ahead of the ego car are displaying red, necessitating that the ego car stop at the intersection and wait for the signal to change before proceeding.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the scene to report."
