        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are multiple road users and objects of interest that influence the driving decisions of the ego car. Firstly, there is a blue bus on the left side of the road, coming toward the ego vehicle from the opposite direction. The large size of the bus necessitates that the ego car maintain its lane position to ensure a safe distance is kept between the two. \n\nAdditionally, several cars are parked along the right side of the road. These stationary vehicles present a risk as they may obscure pedestrians attempting to cross the road or result in doors being opened into the path of the ego car. Caution is advised due to the possible sudden appearance of hazards from these parked cars.\n\nAlongside these parked cars, there are pedestrians walking close to the driving path of the ego car. The proximity of these pedestrians to the traffic flow means the driver should remain vigilant and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nA cyclist is also present on the right side, closer to the ego vehicle than the pedestrians, and is traveling in the same direction as the ego car. Sharing the road with the cyclist means the ego car may need to adjust its lane position and modulate speed to safely coexist with the cyclist.\n\nOn the right side of the ego vehicle's lane, there are traffic cones lined up, signaling a lane closure or a merging situation ahead. This arrangement of cones requires the ego car to possibly merge left into another lane and to lower its speed to navigate the disruption safely.\n\nComplementing the traffic cones, there is a traffic barrier tape connected to the cones, increasing both visibility and awareness of the need for lane changes or heightened caution. This barrier tape further alerts the driver to the potential hazards that lie ahead, underscoring the importance of a cautious approach."
