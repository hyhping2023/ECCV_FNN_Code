Additionally, a white hatchback is in the left adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. This car impacts the decision to change lanes to the left and requires monitoring of its speed.\n\nPedestrians are visible on the right sidewalk, walking parallel to the traffic flow. Although they are not on the road, their presence necessitates caution in case they unexpectedly cross the road or move closer to the traffic lane.\n\nA blue parking sign is located on the right side of the road, past the pedestrians. This sign indicates parking areas or regulations but does not directly affect immediate driving decisions.\n\nA series of orange traffic cones are positioned to the right of the ego car, separating the traffic lane from the sidewalk. These cones suggest a restricted area, possibly due to road work or a hazard, requiring the ego car to remain to the left and avoid crossing the cones.\n\nLastly, an open car door of the ego car is visible on the right side of the image. This indicates a stationary state and presents a hazard. The door should be closed before the vehicle moves to ensure safety and prevent collisions."
