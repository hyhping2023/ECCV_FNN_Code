Additionally, multiple vehicles are parked on both sides of the street ahead, which also reduces road width. This suggests a populated area where there may be sudden movements by pedestrians or other vehicles, requiring the ego car to be prepared for obstructions.\n\nThere are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists at the moment, and thus, none of these users influence driving behavior currently. No traffic signs or traffic lights are visible in the image, meaning the ego car should follow standard traffic laws and remain alert for any changes in the environment.\n\nSome garbage bins are placed by the roadside next to a tree, with scattered refuse. These objects could indicate potential pedestrian activity, and there is a possibility of the refuse or bins ending up on the road as obstacles."
