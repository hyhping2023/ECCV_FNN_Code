        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several elements that are captured and described. On the right side of the road, there are parked cars covered with snow, suggesting that they have been stationary for some time due to the cold weather. This situation doesn't present immediate moving threats but does reduce the available road width, necessitating more cautious navigation. Similarly, there is a truck parked close to the ego vehicle on the right side. Its lights are on, which indicates the truck could have recently stopped or might be preparing to move. As such, there's a need to be mindful of this truck possibly entering the road when passing by. In addition to the parked cars and truck, the headlights of an oncoming vehicle are visible in the distance, coming towards the ego car. This oncoming vehicle could be a risk based on its speed and proximity, so it's critical to maintain proper lane discipline and readiness to respond to any changes.\n\nApart from the vehicles, there are bright light sources on the sides of the road. These could be street lamps or headlights from other vehicles. The brightness of these lights poses a challenge as they can cause glare, potentially impairing the visual capabilities of the ego vehicle's systems or the human driver. Careful attention is needed to navigate without being blinded by these lights.\n\nNo other categories, such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image, and therefore, they are not mentioned in this summary."
