These structures provide stability and containment for materials being transported, ensuring they do not spill onto the road during transit. The appearance and size of the vehicle suggest that it is typically used in settings requiring significant material transport and might impact driving behavior by necessitating increased following distance and reduced speeds by the ego car to accommodate for potential stops or slow movement of the construction vehicle.",

Continue to monitor the situation for any changes, such as the truck lowering its bed or changing lanes."
