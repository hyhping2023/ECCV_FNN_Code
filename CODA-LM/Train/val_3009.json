        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there is a white sedan directly in front of the ego car with its brake lights on, positioned slightly to the left side of the lane. The activation of the brake lights suggests that the sedan is slowing down or has come to a stop, requiring the ego car to also prepare to decelerate or halt to maintain a safe distance. Further ahead, there is a line of vehicles indicated by several red taillights in the same lane as the ego car, signaling congestion or slow-moving traffic. The ego car should adjust its speed to match the flow of traffic and be ready for possible stop-and-go conditions.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a red truck is parked, facing the same direction as the ego car. Although the truck is not directly blocking the path, it could obscure pedestrians or other road users who might emerge from behind it, so the ego car needs to remain vigilant for any unexpected movements.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign overhead on the right side of the road, which provides information about the upcoming intersection and potential turns. It is important for the ego car to take note of this sign to make correct lane choices if a turn is planned.\n\nAbove the line of vehicles, there is a red traffic light visible on the right side. This red light means that the vehicles ahead are either already stopped or will be stopping soon, and thus the ego car must be ready to stop and wait for the light to change to green.\n\nLastly, there is debris located on the right side of the road next to the parked truck. This debris poses a risk to vehicles that might try to park or navigate around the truck, and the ego car should steer clear of the debris to avoid any potential hazards."
