It is noticeable due to the illumination from a street light. This equipment is particularly relevant as it obstructs a part of the lane, presenting a hazard that could potentially limit both the maneuverability and visibility for the autonomous vehicle. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the scene that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

It appears to be large and heavy, possibly equipped with machinery for construction tasks. The presence of such a vehicle on the road can significantly influence driving behavior. Drivers must maintain a safe distance and be cautious of potential sudden stops or movements from the construction vehicle, which may maneuver at lower speeds and take wider turns than standard vehicles.",
