This vehicle could potentially slow down, turn, or stop, so the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust its speed accordingly.\n  - A white van is in the right lane slightly ahead of the ego car, also facing the same direction. The van's presence requires the ego car to be aware of potential lane changes from the van, which might require the ego car to decelerate or maneuver.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: \n  - A yellow diamond-shaped sign with a right-pointing arrow indicates a merging lane from the right. The ego car should be cautious of vehicles that may be entering the lane from the right-side merge area.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: \n  - A traffic light is visible, showing green for going straight, which is relevant for future driving behavior. The green light indicates that the ego car should proceed with caution, respecting the right of way and monitoring the intersection for unexpected hazards.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: \n  - Orange traffic cones are lining the left side of the leftmost lane, indicating a section of the road may be cordoned off for construction or other reasons. The cones signal a potential hazard or reduced lane width, requiring the ego car to maintain lane discipline and not veer towards the construction zone.\n\n- **Barriers**: \n  - Yellow barriers are placed immediately to the left of the ego car's lane, suggesting ongoing road work or a boundary for the driving area.
