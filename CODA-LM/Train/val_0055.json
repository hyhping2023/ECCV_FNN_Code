Additionally, there is a dark-colored sedan on the road ahead of the ego vehicle, also facing away from it, which could potentially move or stop suddenly, necessitating that the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance.\n\nThere is a blue and yellow directional sign placed in the middle of the road, indicating a merge or lane shift to the left. The ego vehicle needs to respond to this sign by preparing to change lanes or adjust its positioning accordingly to the road layout.\n\nFurthermore, yellow and black temporary barricades are positioned on the right side of the road, indicating a closed or restricted lane.
