First, there is a white car moving in the same direction as the ego car, positioned on the right side of the road ahead. The presence and movement of this car will be influential to the ego car's decisions regarding speed and the appropriate following distance.\n\nFurther ahead on the road, there is a blue truck that is parked on the right side. The truck's parked position may block the line of sight for the ego car, necessitating cautious driving and possible maneuvering to maintain visibility and safety.\n\nOn the roadside ahead, there is a blue direction sign positioned. This traffic sign is meant to inform the driver of the ego car of the direction of the road, possibly requiring adjustments to the car's driving path.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of orange traffic cones aligned on the right side of the ego car's lane. The cones suggest that there may be upcoming road work or other obstacles. This means that the ego car might need to slow down or consider changing lanes to avoid the hazard.\n\nLastly, concrete barriers are installed on the right side of the road, serving to demarcate the driving lane from the side area. These barriers effectively reduce the width of the driving lane, which influences the lateral positioning of the ego car within its lane."
