A white SUV is parked on the right side of the road, facing towards the ego car. Although it is stationary and should not influence the immediate movement of the ego car, the ego car needs to remain aware in case the SUV starts to move or if passengers exit the vehicle.\n2. Several cars are parked in a line on the right side of the road, parallel to the road, and facing away from the ego car. These vehicles, being parked, should not affect the ego car's immediate path. However, attention is required for any unexpected movements from these vehicles or their passengers.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users:\n1. There is a small dog located on the right side of the road ahead of the ego car. This poses a potential hazard as the dog might enter the driving lane, necessitating that the ego car slow down and be prepared to stop if required.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image based on the given data."
