This indicates that the ego car and other traffic have the right to proceed. However, it's essential for the ego car to stay cautious for any unexpected behavior from other road users.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones to the right of the ego car, indicating some form of road work or lane closure ahead.

This bollard might be placed here to protect a particular area adjacent to the roadway or to separate pedestrian pathways from vehicular traffic lanes.
