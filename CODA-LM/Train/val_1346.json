The presence of this vehicle in a traffic scenario indicates an ongoing or upcoming construction activity nearby. For the ego car, this implies a potential decrease in speed and an increase in caution required while driving past this vehicle or through the construction zone. The construction vehicle could lead to changed traffic patterns or temporary road blockages, prompting the ego car to possibly alter its route or prepare for stop-and-go traffic conditions.",

Avoid unnecessary lane changes unless the truck shows signs of slowing down or if there's a need to take a turn as indicated by the route. Be attentive to the vehicles in adjacent lanes, especially when considering a lane change. Use headlights appropriately to ensure visibility. Monitor speed to ensure it is appropriate for the low-light and wet road conditions."
