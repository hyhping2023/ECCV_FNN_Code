Some of these vehicles are at a distance, while one is closer to the right, directly in the line of sight of the ego car. The presence of these vehicles means that the ego car must be ready to respond to potential actions such as slowing down, stopping, or lane changes from these vehicles.\n\nA traffic sign is partially visible on the left side of the image, obscured by a tree. Due to the low visibility and distance, it is not possible to confidently identify the type of sign. This situation requires the ego car to continue with caution until the sign's instructions are clear.\n\nThe traffic light is visible on the right side, but it emits a bright, overexposed light that makes the color indistinguishable. The ego car should approach the intersection with caution, ready to stop if necessary, since the state of the traffic light cannot be determined.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red and white barrier on the right side of the lane, close to the ego car, which could indicate road work or a closed lane. This barrier may require the ego car to slow down and potentially change lanes to avoid a narrowed path or road hazard.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there are objects that are difficult to identify, possibly waste bins or other types of street furniture. While these objects do not currently pose a threat to the roadway, it is important to monitor them in case pedestrians interact with them or if they unexpectedly enter the roadway."
