One car is positioned at the fuel pump on the left side, facing towards the pump, presumably refueling. This vehicle is stationary, indicating a need for caution while maneuvering around the fuel station. The second white car is parked behind the first, facing the same direction, and is either waiting to use the fuel pump or simply parked. Like the first vehicle, this car is also not in motion, requiring careful navigation to avoid any collisions in the vicinity of the fuel station.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed in front of the ego vehicle, marking an area that should not be entered or indicating a path that should be followed. These cones act as temporary barriers, guiding the ego vehicle to steer clear of the restricted area and follow a safe path through the fuel station.\n\nAdditionally, yellow and black striped barriers are installed around the fuel pumps. These barriers are likely there to protect the pumps from accidental vehicle impacts, and thus, the ego car must be driven with caution to avoid these barriers while navigating around them.\n\nThere is also pedestrian activity around the fuel station. Although not directly on the road, pedestrians could potentially enter the driving path of the ego vehicle, necessitating heightened awareness and a reduction in speed.\n\nLastly, there is a dustbin located on the right side towards the entrance of the service station. The dustbin is stationary and should not obstruct the vehicle's path, but drivers should maintain spatial awareness to prevent any collisions."

In this driving scenario, the presence of the traffic cone suggests that there might be a temporary restriction or hazard ahead in the driving path of the ego car.
