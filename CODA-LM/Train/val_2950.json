These cars pose a potential hazard as their doors might open into the lane or they might suddenly start moving. Additionally, there are vehicles ahead in the same lane with their taillights on, suggesting they are either slowing down or stopped, thus influencing the driving pace and required stopping distance.\n\nReflective road signs are visible at a distance on the right side of the road, indicating the presence of important information such as warnings or directions. Moreover, yellow and black traffic cones are also present on the right, signifying a partition or work zone, which restricts the usable width of the lane and marks an area that requires caution."
