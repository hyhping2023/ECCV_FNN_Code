This vehicle seems to be stationary or moving slowly, which could impede the ego car's ability to maintain its regular speed in the left lane. Additionally, there is a traffic light situated above the intersection, currently displaying a green light. This indicates that the ego car has the right of way to proceed. However, as the ego car approaches the intersection, it should proceed with caution despite the green light. Alongside the road, there are traffic poles and electricity or telecommunication poles. While these objects do not directly influence the driving behavior, it is important to be aware of them as fixed structures to avoid any potential collisions. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image."
