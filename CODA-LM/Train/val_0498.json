A dark car is seen in the middle of the intersection, moving forward, which is significant because it is in the direct path of the ego car, affecting its speed and following distance. There is also a white SUV parked on the right side of the road. Although this SUV is not an immediate threat, its presence might conceal pedestrians or other vehicles from view. On the left side of the intersection, several motorcycles, some with riders, are noted. They might enter the intersection soon, which would require the ego car's caution as they could cross its path. Additionally, there is a white car parked near the curb on the left, but like the SUV, it doesnâ€™t pose an immediate threat yet might obscure other road users.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, two pedestrians are in the process of crossing the street directly in front of the ego car and must be given priority. There is also a group of pedestrians observed on the sidewalk to the right, near storefronts. While they are not an immediate danger, the potential for unexpected movement into the street suggests they should be carefully watched.\n\nThe only traffic sign identified in the image is a 'No parking' sign located on the left side of the road. This sign helps maintain the lane's accessibility by forbidding parking in the vicinity.\n\nThe scene does not contain any traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that can influence the ego car's driving behavior."
