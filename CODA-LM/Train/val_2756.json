Traffic lights in the image are showing green, indicating that the ego car can proceed through the intersection if it is safe to do so, despite the other road users present. Moreover, a blue barrier is located on the side of the road, which may suggest ongoing construction or maintenance work, and the ego car should be cautious of any potential hazards or obstructions.
