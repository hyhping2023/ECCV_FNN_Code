This vehicle poses no immediate threat but its movements should be monitored in case it changes lanes or performs any unpredictable actions.\n    - There are several small trucks and motorcycles ahead on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles vary in size and maneuverability. They might stop suddenly, turn, or change lanes, which could affect the ego vehicleâ€™s path or necessitate an adjustment in speed.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n    - Multiple pedestrians are visible on the right edge of the image, close to the moving traffic. These pedestrians could unexpectedly enter the roadway, requiring the ego vehicle to be prepared to stop or slow down if necessary.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n    - There are no traffic lights visible in the image. Without traffic light guidance, the ego car needs to be more vigilant about the intentions of other road users and right-of-way rules.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that require attention."

Cyclists are considered vulnerable road users and their presence requires surrounding traffic to maintain a safe passing distance. The ego car must reduce its speed and provide ample space while overtaking or approaching the cyclist to avoid collisions and ensure the safety of all parties involved.",

Since no traffic lights are visible, follow standard right of way rules and proceed with caution. Drive according to road conditions and adjust speed as necessary to account for the other road users."
