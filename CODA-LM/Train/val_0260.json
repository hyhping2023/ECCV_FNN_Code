Ahead on the right side of the road, there is a blue bus facing the same direction as the ego car. This bus may stop to pick up or drop off passengers, creating a potential temporary obstruction. Further ahead, there are several cars travelling in the same direction, which will impact the ego car's speed and lane selection.\n\nOn the far right, there's a cyclist moving in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist's potential changes in course or speed necessitate vigilance and possibly a lane change or speed adjustment by the ego car. Additionally, there's a pedestrian who appears to be crossing the street on the zebra crossing on the right, although they are behind the lane dividers. The ego car must be ready to yield if the pedestrian continues to cross.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a no-left-turn sign is visible to the right, indicating that left turns are not allowed at the upcoming intersection, thus the ego car should not plan to turn left there. Above the road, directional signs are present, informing the ego car on how to pick the correct lane to follow its intended path.\n\nFor the traffic lights, there are green lights ahead for the direction the ego car is travelling, indicating it can continue through the intersection when it's safe.\n\nRed and white traffic cones are placed on the right, marking the separation between the bike lane and the car lanes, denoting a boundary the ego car should not cross.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects listed, suggesting the image is clear of these potential obstacles."
