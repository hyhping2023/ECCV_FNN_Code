The presence of this vehicle requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance behind it and be ready to follow its lead once the traffic light turns green.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic scene includes a traffic sign with a green arrow pointing upwards, indicating a lane designated for moving straight ahead. This sign guides the ego car to stay in its lane and proceed forward when the traffic light for the lane turns green.\n\nThe traffic lights are currently displaying a red signal for the lanes going straight, which means the ego car must remain stationary. However, there is a green arrow signal for the lane that turns left, allowing vehicles in that lane to make the turn.\n\nTo the right of the ego car, red and white traffic cones are arranged, marking off an area of the road that should not be entered. These cones suggest there might be roadworks or obstacles, and they signal the ego car to stay in its current lane and avoid moving into the coned-off space.\n\nLastly, there is a pedestrian crosswalk in the scene, but no pedestrians are crossing at the moment. The crosswalk's presence alerts the ego car to be vigilant for any pedestrians that may enter the crosswalk when the vehicular traffic light turns green."
