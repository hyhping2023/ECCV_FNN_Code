There are two vehicles ahead: a white sedan directly ahead has its brake lights on indicating it is slowing down or stopping, therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe distance and prepare to adjust its speed accordingly. Next, there is a bus ahead in the left lane, only partially visible, posing potential risks such as pedestrians crossing in front of the bus or the bus merging right which the ego car should be cautious of.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes vulnerable road users; pedestrians are noted on the right sidewalk, walking parallel to the road. Itâ€™s crucial for the ego car to monitor these pedestrians in case they decide to cross the road unexpectedly, to ensure safety for all parties involved.\n\nRegarding road modifications, red and white traffic cones are positioned to the right of the ego car, signaling a closed lane or ongoing road works. It is important for the ego car to avoid attempting to enter the closed lane and remain vigilant for any adjustments in traffic patterns or the presence of road workers.\n\nThis summarization covers all the relevant entities and necessary precautions identified in the traffic scene, highlighting the essential considerations for the ego car's driving decisions.\n"
