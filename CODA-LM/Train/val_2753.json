This stationary vehicle is a potential obstruction and safety hazard, necessitating caution and possibly requiring the ego car to maneuver around it. Additionally, there is a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk near the cement mixer truck. The proximity of the pedestrian to the stationary vehicle calls for increased vigilance to ensure their safety. Furthermore, metal barriers or fences are present, separating the sidewalk from the road. These barriers serve to delineate the pedestrian areas from the vehicle traffic lanes, guiding the ego car to remain within the designated road space. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a concrete mixer truck. It is designed to mix and transport concrete in a rotating drum to construction sites. The presence of this type of vehicle in traffic can imply active construction areas nearby. Additionally, such vehicles can influence driving behavior by necessitating a greater following distance due to potential debris falling from the rotating drum, and the need for wider turns that these heavy vehicles often make. Drivers behind and around this truck should remain cautious and adjust their speed accordingly to maintain safety.",

It may need to slow down significantly or come to a complete stop, and then carefully maneuver around the cement mixer truck while maintaining a safe distance from the pedestrian. Constant vigilance and readiness to react to any unexpected movements from the pedestrian or other potential hazards are crucial."
