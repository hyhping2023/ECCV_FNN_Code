It is moving forward with its drum rotating and is partially encroaching into the ego vehicle's lane. This situation requires the ego vehicle to be cautious to maintain its lane and avoid a potential collision.\n\nAhead in the right lane, there is a stationary pickup truck with its brake lights off. The ego vehicle must be prepared for the possibility that the pickup truck could either remain stationary or start moving unexpectedly.\n\nOn the right, a flatbed truck is occupying the right lane and is moving forward. It is loaded with cargo covered in sacks. The presence of this large vehicle can affect the flow of traffic and may lead to visibility issues or unpredictable maneuvers that the ego vehicle needs to anticipate.\n\nA pedestrian is also present on the left side, walking across the street and facing left. Pedestrians like this can change their path or speed without warning, necessitating vigilant monitoring by the ego vehicle.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is green for through traffic, which allows the ego vehicle and other road users to proceed. However, the ego vehicle must remain alert for a potential change in the traffic light phase.\n\nThere are traffic cones on the right side of the road, which are demarcating an area of construction or a road hazard. These cones suggest that there may be disruptions to the normal traffic flow, and the ego vehicle should adjust its driving accordingly.\n\nLastly, there is a white temporary barrier with an orange and white striped pattern on the right, indicating a partition or roadworks area. This barrier guides the ego vehicle to stay in its lane and be aware of the road closure.\n\nNo traffic signs or other objects are present in the scene that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
