        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic image, several road users and traffic control elements are present, which are important for determining the autonomous vehicle's behavior.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there is a silver van positioned directly ahead of the ego car, slightly to the left within the same lane, suggesting that the ego car may need to adjust its speed or change lanes based on the van's actions. Additionally, there are vehicles on the right side that seem to be either moving or preparing to merge into the traffic flow, which could reduce the available lateral space for the ego car, requiring it to possibly alter its speed or lane positioning. Moreover, a white car is spotted in the left adjacent lane, ahead of the ego car, calling for careful lane discipline and monitoring for safe overtaking maneuvers.\n\nFor traffic signs, the ego car is being informed by an overhead speed limit sign of '60' as well as a no overtaking sign; these are on the right side of the road and affect how the ego car regulates its speed and overtaking behavior.\n\nWhen it comes to traffic lights, a green light is visible ahead for the direction the ego car is traveling, with a perpendicular red light indicating that the ego car has the right of way to move forward.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white traffic cones positioned in the intersection's center, demarcating an area to the left, likely indicating a closure due to construction or an event, which the ego car must acknowledge to avoid this zone.\n\nLastly, a barrier with a red and white pattern blocks the intersection from merging traffic on the left, signaling a road closure. This information is critical for the ego car's route planning through the intersection.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, other objects, or traffic cones are detected in the image, so these do not have any impact on the driving scenario."

Keep in lane while passing by the traffic cones and barrier, being aware of potential changes in the traffic pattern due to the closed-off area."
