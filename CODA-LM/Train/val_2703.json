Additionally, there is traffic congestion ahead with multiple cars visible on the road, which would require the ego car to be ready to slow down or even come to a halt to avoid potential collisions.\n\nVulnerable road users in this scenario include a pedestrian who is crossing the street in the crosswalk area while walking a dog. The ego car has to yield the right of way to them to ensure their safety. There is also a group of motorcyclists off to the side of the road; the ego car should be vigilant since they might merge into the traffic lane, necessitating action from the ego car to yield if needed.\n\nThe only traffic light in sight is displaying a red signal, which implies that the intersection ahead is not accessible at the moment. The ego car must stop at this light and wait for it to change to green before proceeding through the intersection.\n\nThe JSON data indicates no presence of traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the traffic image, so these elements do not impact the driving behavior of the ego car in the current situation."
