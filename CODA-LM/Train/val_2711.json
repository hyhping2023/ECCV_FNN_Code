        "description and explanation": "The scene contains a few notable elements affecting traffic. On the right side of the road, there is a line of parked cars positioned parallel to the curb. As these cars are stationary and do not appear to be entering the traffic flow, the ego vehicle can proceed with caution. It is important for the ego vehicle to stay alert for any random door openings or pedestrians that could emerge unexpectedly from between the parked cars.\n\nFurthermore, there are yellow and black striped traffic barriers on the left side of the road. These barriers signify that there is a section of the road that is not accessible for driving, likely a closed lane. Consequently, the ego vehicle is expected to maintain its current lane and should not attempt to swerve into the closed section.\n\nLastly, an operational boom barrier can be seen at the parking lot's exit on the right side, which is showing a green light. This typically means that the barrier is already open or is about to open, signaling that a vehicle might be exiting the parking lot shortly. In response, the ego vehicle should be prepared to slow down or come to a stop to safely allow the vehicle from the parking lot to merge into traffic."
