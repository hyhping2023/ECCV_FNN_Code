This vehicle could potentially slow down or stop, requiring the ego car to adjust its speed accordingly. Additionally, there is a white van in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. The van has the potential to change lanes, either towards or away from the ego car, which necessitates maintaining a safe distance and preparedness for possible evasive maneuvers.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**: Overhead directional signs are spanning across the lanes, indicating lane destinations with arrows and text. These signs provide information about lane usage and upcoming exits or directions, which can influence the ego car's lane choice and routing decisions.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: A traffic cone is present on the left side of the road, marking the edge of a lane separation barrier. This ensures that the ego car stays within the boundaries of its lane and avoids drifting towards the barrier.\n\n- **Barriers**: Red lane separation barriers are seen on the left, delineating the boundary between the ongoing lanes and the opposite side of the road. These barriers prevent crossing into oncoming traffic and require that the ego vehicle stays within the lane markings.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects are present in the observed image."
