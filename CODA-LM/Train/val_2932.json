One vehicle is directly ahead in the same lane with brake lights illuminated, indicating it is either slowing down or stopping, which means the ego car must adjust its speed and following distance accordingly. There is also an oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane with its headlights on, moving towards the ego car, posing a potential hazard if it crosses into the ego lane; thus, the ego car should monitor it and keep a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, a yellow traffic cone is positioned on the right side of the ego lane near the guardrail, potentially indicating road work or a hazard that may necessitate a lane change if the lane ahead is obstructed. The right side of the road also features a guardrail, marking the boundary of the driving lane and defining the limit of the safe driving space for the ego car on that side."

Such signs typically instruct or alert drivers to upcoming road conditions, changes in road layout, or specific hazards such as construction areas.

Stay in the current lane unless the path is obstructed, and if a lane change is necessary, perform it with caution."
