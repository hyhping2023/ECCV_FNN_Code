Specifically, a large articulated truck with a tanker trailer is parked on the right side of the road, taking up one lane and partially blocking the view ahead. This parked tanker truck is likely to obstruct the flow of traffic and indicates potential stoppage or slow traffic in the vicinity. Consequently, as there are no visible traffic lights in the image to guide the driving behavior, reliance on general road rules and caution becomes imperative. Additionally, yellow and black road barriers mark the boundary between the driving lane and the area occupied by the truck, guiding traffic and explicitly indicating that entering the demarcated area is prohibited for the ego car."

The truck is stationed and not currently in motion, which suggests it is either loading or unloading goods. If the ego car is intending to pass or operate in close proximity, it must maintain a safe distance due to the truck's length and potential movement when it resumes travel.
