This requires the ego car to either slow down and prepare to stop behind the stationary vehicle or safely change lanes to continue. Additionally, a blue directional sign is positioned on the right side of the road, showing points of interest and lane directions. Although this sign does not directly affect immediate driving decisions, it aids in navigation and lane selection for the desired route. Moreover, orange traffic cones are placed along the right edge of the right-hand lane, indicative of an upcoming work zone or lane obstruction. These cones signal that the ego vehicle may need to change lanes as the right lane could be merging or closed ahead."
