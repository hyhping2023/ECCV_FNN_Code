Directly in front of the ego vehicle is a cement mixer truck, which is obstructing the partial view ahead and displaying brake lights, suggesting it is slowing down or stopped. This requires the ego vehicle to adjust its following distance and speed to ensure safe driving. To the left of the cement mixer truck is a maroon SUV, also showing brake lights, likely indicating a traffic slowdown that the ego vehicle needs to be prepared for. To the right of the ego vehicle, visible through the right side mirror, is a silver sedan which is in close proximity to the ego vehicle's lane and needs to be monitored for potential lane changes or to maintain a safe lateral distance. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."

For the ego car, this means maintaining a safe following distance and being cautious of the potential for sudden stops or changes in the bus's movement, especially in busy traffic conditions. Buses may also make frequent stops to pick up or drop off passengers, which requires additional attentiveness from nearby drivers to accommodate the changing traffic flow caused by these stops.",

Its presence in traffic can affect driving behavior as such vehicles are typically slower and have limited maneuverability. Drivers in the vicinity, including the ego car, need to exercise patience and provide sufficient space for the truck to maneuver. The possibility of debris falling from the truck, as indicated by material visible on the mixers chute, also advises maintaining a safe distance to avoid potential damage to the vehicle or windshield.",
