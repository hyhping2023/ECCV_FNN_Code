Additionally, a silver sedan is directly in front of the ego car, within the same lane, and it appears to be either slowing down or coming to a stop. The ego car must adjust its speed and maintain an appropriate following distance due to the sedan's positioning and potential movement. The parked vehicles pose a risk as well, as there is a possibility of a door opening or a vehicle pulling out into traffic unexpectedly.\n\nOn the right side of the road, several pedestrians are observed on the sidewalk and near the crosswalk. The presence of pedestrians in close proximity to the road necessitates that the ego car be ready to stop or yield, as they might step into the crosswalk or onto the road.\n\nA pedestrian crossing sign is also present on the right side of the road, signaling the location of a crosswalk. This sign indicates that the ego car should remain vigilant for pedestrians and be prepared to yield to them as they enter or are about to enter the crosswalk.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
