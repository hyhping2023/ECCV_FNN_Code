The parked SUV is partially blocking the right lane, and the large size of the concrete mixer truck may obstruct visibility ahead for the ego car.\n\nMultiple traffic signs are visible in the image. One sign, located next to the concrete mixer truck, indicates no stopping or standing on the right side, symbolized by a red slash over a blue background. Another sign displays a speed limit of 10, suggesting a low-speed zone, likely due to a construction area or high-activity area.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light with a green light illuminated is visible on the right side, near the speed limit sign. This signals that the ego car has the right of way and may proceed if the path is clear."

Such vehicles are usually heavy and move slower than typical cars, requiring greater stopping distances and careful handling during turns. The presence of this vehicle in traffic significantly influences the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution, maintaining a safe following distance, and being prepared for unexpected stops or slow movement.",
