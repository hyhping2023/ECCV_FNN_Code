Its presence on the road typically indicates ongoing or nearby construction work. For the driver of the ego car, encountering such a vehicle necessitates increased caution and awareness. It may lead to potential slowdowns or traffic adjustments due to the vehicle's operations, size, and the associated construction zone activities.
