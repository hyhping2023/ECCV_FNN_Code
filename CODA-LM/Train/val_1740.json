This vehicle could potentially slow down, stop, or change lanes, affecting the driving behavior of the ego car. Further up the road, in the same lane as the ego car, there are several cars at a distance. The traffic flow and potential changes in the speed of these vehicles will influence the ego car's speed and lane choice.\n\nOn the left side, there is a worker wearing a blue uniform and holding a broom. The presence of this worker near the roadway increases the risk of an unexpected entry into the road, requiring the ego car to be cautious and prepared to slow down or stop.\n\nAbove the road, there are directional signs indicating lanes for straight movement and either a turn or a nearby hospital. The ego car would need to choose the correct lane based on its intended path. Additionally, there are traffic signs by the roadside to the far right, which could dictate parking behavior and inform the ego car about potential stopping vehicles.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is placed on the edge of the road before a cleaning vehicle, signaling a potential hazard or work zone. This indicates that the ego car should keep a safe distance and be alert for possible obstructions. Near the cleaning vehicle, there is also a bollard-like object on the edge of the road, serving as a physical boundary to prevent vehicles from veering off the road. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from this barrier.\n\nLastly, there is a green and yellow street cleaning vehicle parked on the left side of the road. It suggests that there might be potential movement or workers around, and the ego car should be alert for any sudden changes.\n\nThere are no traffic lights in the image, so this category is not considered in the summary."
