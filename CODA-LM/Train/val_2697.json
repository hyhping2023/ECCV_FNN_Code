Additionally, there is a person crouched on the ground toward the right side in front of the ego vehicle. The individual is engaged in some activity on the ground and poses a safety risk, which may require the autonomous vehicle to slow down or stop to avoid an accident. Large spools of cable are stacked around the area, indicating that it may be a limited-access or industrial region, signifying a non-standard driving environment that could involve unexpected traffic patterns or obstructions. Furthermore, various pieces of industrial equipment and debris are scattered in the vicinity, hinting at possible construction or storage site activities. This situation means the vehicle should navigate carefully, as normal traffic conditions likely do not apply, and obstructions might affect the usual driving route."
