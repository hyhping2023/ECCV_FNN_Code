The ego vehicle should keep a safe distance and be ready to adjust its speed accordingly. Additionally, there is a large concrete mixer truck in the lane to the left, which is either moving forward or coming to a stop. The size of the truck could block the ego vehicle's view and limit its ability to maneuver, so caution is advised.\n\nA traffic light in the distance is showing green, suggesting that traffic is currently flowing, but the ego vehicle should remain alert to any changes in traffic or the light's status.\n\nGuardrails are present on both sides of the road, separating the driving lanes from pedestrian areas, and a central barrier divides the oncoming traffic from the ego vehicle's lane. These barriers delineate the driving path and limit the possibility of lateral movements by the ego vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically identified as a cement mixer. It is equipped with a large rotating drum used to mix cement and other building materials. The presence of this vehicle in traffic suggests a slower movement because these types of vehicles typically travel at lower speeds due to their heavy loads and operational requirements. Additionally, this kind of vehicle might make frequent stops or unexpected maneuvers if heading towards a construction site, which influences the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and remain vigilant to quick changes in the traffic ahead.",

Continue to observe the green traffic light while being ready to respond to any changes. No lane changes seem necessary or safe at this moment due to the large vehicle in the adjacent lane and barriers on both sides."
