This sign requires that the right lane be kept clear for buses, and as a result, the ego car should not use the right lane in compliance with lane usage rules. Additionally, there is a red traffic light ahead, which means the ego car must come to a stop at the intersection ahead due to the red light. There are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects affecting the driving behavior of the ego car in this image."
