        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a cement truck directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the same lane. The truck is characterized by its rotating drum and visible construction elements. The presence of the cement truck is significant as its large size and the debris that may come off it pose potential risks to the ego vehicle's safety. Consequently, the ego vehicle must adjust its speed and maintain an appropriate following distance to ensure safe driving conditions. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck characterized by the large rotating drum used for mixing concrete. This type of vehicle is generally larger and heavier than standard vehicles. The presence of this construction vehicle in a traffic situation like a tunnel, as shown in the image, significantly influences the driving behavior of the ego car. Due to its size and the nature of its load, which can be hazardous if spilled, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slow-downs or stops that might arise from the operation of the construction vehicle.",

Engage windshield wipers if needed to ensure visibility. Prepare for potential evasive maneuvers if debris becomes a direct hazard. No lane change is suggested given the current scenario and lack of visible adjacent lanes."
