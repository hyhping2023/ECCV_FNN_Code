The truck's rear red lights are illuminated, which suggests that it is either slowing down or has come to a stop. The ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to respond to the truck's actions, as they significantly influence the ego car's ability to proceed.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a 'No Left Turn' traffic sign that is well-lit by streetlights. This sign is crucial as it informs the ego car that it is not permitted to make a left turn at the upcoming intersection or junction, thereby affecting its route planning and turning decisions.\n\nAdditionally, there are white and orange striped traffic barriers on the right side of the ego vehicle's lane. These barriers serve to guide the ego vehicle by delineating the navigable area and indicating that there may be road work ahead or a redirection of traffic lanes.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the scene that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
