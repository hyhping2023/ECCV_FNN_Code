The presence of these vehicles affects the driving behavior of the ego car by requiring it to maintain a safe following distance due to the density of traffic, which also impacts the driving speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light at an intersection ahead displaying a green signal. This green light indicates that the vehicles in the ego car's lane have the right of way to proceed through the intersection, guiding the ego car's decision to continue moving forward without stopping.\n\nConcrete barriers are also present on the left side of the ego car, separating the opposing traffic lanes. These barriers indicate that the road is divided and restrict the ego car's ability to make left turns or maneuvers across the median.\n\nLastly, the image includes the challenge of sun glare, which reduces visibility and may require the ego car to exercise extra caution. The glare from the sun can make it difficult to see traffic signals, road signs, and the actions of other road users, thus affecting the driving strategy.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects affecting the driving conditions in this particular image."
