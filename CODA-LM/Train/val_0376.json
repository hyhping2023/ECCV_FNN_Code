This bus's size and position directly influence the ego car's ability to maneuver, potentially necessitating a change in speed or lane. Additionally, a beige bus is observed in the left lane, parallel to the ego car and moving in the same direction. This beige bus occupies the adjacent lane, which needs to be clear should the ego car intend to change lanes.\n\nOn the right side of the ego car's lane, there are orange traffic cones placed, indicating a narrowing of the driving lane or a potential road hazard. These traffic cones guide traffic and prevent vehicles from entering potentially unsafe areas beside the road.\n\nVisible on the right are metal barriers, which separate the road from a construction zone. These barriers mark the construction area and suggest the possibility of workers or machinery being close to the driving path.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are present in the image."
