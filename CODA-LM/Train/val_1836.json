            "description and explanation": "This object is a metallic staircase with a series of perforated steps, ascending in a vertical pattern. It is part of a larger vehicle, likely a concrete mixer or a similar heavy-duty vehicle, designed for the driver or operator to access critical components or platforms. In traffic, the existence and position of such a structure indicate the large size and potentially slow mobility of the vehicle it's attached to. Drivers in the vicinity, including the ego car, would need to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for slower movements, particularly in busy or constrained traffic conditions.",

Be aware of the traffic around and ahead given the congestion, and prepare for potential slowing or stopping traffic. Changing lanes may be considered if safe to do so in order to avoid being too close to the large vehicle and to have better visibility of the road ahead."
