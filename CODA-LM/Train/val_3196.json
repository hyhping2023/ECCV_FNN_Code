        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a red truck ahead of the ego vehicle within the same lane, traveling forwards. It is necessary for the ego vehicle to maintain a secure distance behind this truck for safety. Additionally, construction workers are spotted on the road's right side, close to the pedestrian path. The presence of these workers denotes potential risks or alterations in traffic flow, which entails that the ego vehicle should decelerate and stay ready to come to a halt or shift lanes if required.\n\nThere are orange traffic cones lining the right side of the road, causing the lane to become narrower. These cones are indicative of ongoing roadwork or construction, and the ego vehicle must proceed with caution. The reduced lane width might necessitate a lane change to the left for the ego vehicle if the current lane becomes too confined for a secure transit.\n\nAlso, there are temporary fences and barriers erected on the road's right side, segregating the construction site from the traffic. These barriers are a sign of active construction, and it's crucial for the ego vehicle to stay vigilant for any abrupt movements from workers or machinery that might enter the traffic lanes.\n\nFurthermore, there is a fallen traffic cone lying on the road near the right lane. This presents an immediate obstacle which the ego vehicle needs to avoid. The ego vehicle should navigate around the cone or if it is feasible and safe, change lanes to prevent it."
