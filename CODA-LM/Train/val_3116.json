        "description and explanation": "The image presents a traffic scenario featuring one significant road user: a vehicle. The vehicle in question is a large, slow-moving cement mixing truck which is occupying the entire lane directly ahead of the ego car. The truck's mixing apparatus is protruding from the rear, and it is moving in the same direction as the ego car is traveling. The presence of this truck impacts the ego car's driving behavior significantly. Due to the truck's size and the equipment extending from its back, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance, which may be greater than usual. Additionally, the truck's dimensions and protruding equipment might pose a challenge for the ego car if it decides to overtake, potentially hindering such a maneuver. No other road users, traffic signs, lights, cones, barriers, or objects are reported in the image, indicating a clear path except for the aforementioned truck."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, characterized by its cylindrical mixing drum located at the back. In driving scenarios, such a vehicle typically moves slower and makes frequent stops, especially at construction sites. Its presence indicates potential hazards like unexpected stops or construction debris on the road. Therefore, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance, be prepared for sudden braking, and possibly anticipate lane changes around this vehicle to ensure safe driving conditions.",

It should also prepare for potential debris falling from the mixer and consider changing lanes or overtaking only if it is safe and legal to do so, with clear visibility ahead and sufficient space to pass the large vehicle."
