Ahead on the right, there's a construction vehicle, specifically a yellow backhoe loader, with its shovel extended into the lane, potentially obstructing the lane and necessitating a reduction in speed or a lane change by the ego car to maintain safety.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian dressed in blue who is using the zebra crossing ahead of the ego car. As pedestrians have the right of way, the ego car must stop and wait for the pedestrian to complete the crossing before proceeding.\n\nThe traffic situation includes red and white striped barriers set up on both sides of the pedestrian crossing, indicating a closed-off area or ongoing road work. These barriers suggest a construction zone that will likely require drivers to slow down and proceed with extra caution.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white road barriers arranged around a construction site to the right of the ego vehicle, which narrows the lane. These barriers imply a construction zone and may lead to a necessity for vehicles to merge to the left to avoid the construction site.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there's a public dustbin and a bus stop shelter, which are stationary objects. They are part of the overall environmental context and should be recognized for situational awareness, although they do not demand any immediate response from the ego vehicle.\n\nThere are no traffic lights or traffic cones reported in this scenario."
