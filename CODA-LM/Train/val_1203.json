        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, there are no vehicles, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or cyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers within the frame. However, there is a noticeable presence of other objects that impact driving conditions. Specifically, there are significant amounts of snow piled up at the edges of the road. This accumulation of snow has the potential to narrow the available road space for navigation and may also impede visibility. Additionally, a pole is situated to the right side of the road, representing a potential hazard. If the vehicle were to veer off course or slide due to slippery conditions, the pole could become a collision risk."

It is important for the ego car to acknowledge this object to maintain safe passing clearance, avoiding any potential hidden solid obstacles under the snow which could impact vehicle control or cause damage to the vehicle.",

It's located adjacent to the road and poses a less immediate, but notable risk of obstructing the path or causing minor impact if the ego car veers too closely to the road's edge. It is crucial for the driving behavior to incorporate a cautious approach, potentially reducing speed and ensuring adequate distance from the roadside hazard to prevent tire damage or misalignment.",

They can potentially lead to tire damage or loss of control if the ego car travels over them at speed. The presence of this stone would require the driver of the ego-car to possibly change lanes, slow down, or carefully maneuver around it to maintain safety.",
