This requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be ready to adjust its speed. Additionally, there are various vehicles parked on the side of the road, to the right of the ego car. The parked vehicles could potentially block the view of oncoming hazards, necessitating heightened awareness from the ego car driver.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist to the right of the ego car, occupying part of the driving lane and wearing a blue jacket. The positioning of the cyclist indicates that the ego car needs to overtake with caution, ensuring ample space for safety.\n\nFor traffic signs, a no parking sign is visible on the right side of the road, indicating parking restrictions ahead, which serves as a reminder but doesn’t necessitate immediate action. Additionally, directional signs overhead on the right side indicate lane directions that the ego car needs to observe to follow the correct path.\n\nTraffic lights in the image are not clearly visible regarding their operational state for the ego car's direction, suggesting the ego car should move forward cautiously, being ready for potential changes in traffic light conditions.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed in the lane to the right of the ego car, marking a work zone or an area to avoid, directing the ego car not to enter the demarcated zone, likely due to road work or present hazards.\n\nMetal barriers are situated to the right, separating the pedestrian walkway from the road, ensuring that the ego car stays within the road lanes and doesn’t veer into the pedestrian area.\n\nNo other significant objects are noted in the image that could impact the driving behavior of the ego car, making these features the primary focus for the ego car’s navigation decisions in this scenario."
