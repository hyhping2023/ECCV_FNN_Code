This vehicle impacts the ego car's movement forward. To the left is a stationary white van, suggesting it's in a queued traffic line; its position must be considered by the ego car in case a lane change is needed. A stationary green bus is further to the left, indicating the potential for a nearby bus stop, which could lead to sudden pedestrian activity or halted buses that must be anticipated. Although several other vehicles surround the ego car, they are not currently influencing the immediate driving decisions but are kept in view for overall situational awareness.\n\nAs for vulnerable road users, there is a cyclist to the ego car's right, moving in parallel, who could impact lane-changing or turning maneuvers due to their proximity. A pedestrian is also noted to the right, walking along the curb and crossing at the intersection ahead, requiring the ego car to prioritize safety before advancing or executing a turn.\n\nConcerning traffic signs and traffic lights, there are no visible traffic signs that can guide the ego car's instant choices, requiring reliance on the lights and road markings at the intersection. Moreover, the current status of the traffic lights is indiscernible from the image, which necessitates a cautious approach to the intersection by the ego car.\n\nNo traffic cones are visible in the immediate area, and if they were present, they could hint at construction or lane closures that would affect the route. Similarly, there are no barriers visible that would influence the driving path of the ego vehicle.\n\nLastly, an unrelated black advertising board or information sign can be spotted on the sidewalk to the left, but it poses no obstacle to the ego car's travel path. However, it's still essential to monitor such stationary objects due to the possibility of them unexpectedly entering the road."
