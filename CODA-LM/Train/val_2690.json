The presence of this vehicle suggests ongoing or nearby construction work. For the ego vehicle, this means increased caution is advisable due to potential obstructions or unexpected maneuvers by the construction vehicle. The vehicles large size also necessitates maintaining a safe following distance to ensure ample time to respond to sudden stops or debris falling from the mixer.",
