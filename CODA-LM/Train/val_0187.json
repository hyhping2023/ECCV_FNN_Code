A no entry sign is also present to the right of a construction area, prohibiting entry into that area, hence preventing a right turn there.\n\nYellow and red traffic cones are seen to the right, marking the beginning of a construction zone.

Continue to monitor the traffic conditions closely for any sudden changes."
