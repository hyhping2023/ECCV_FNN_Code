The distance and speed of this sedan are factors that will influence the safe following distance the ego car must maintain.\n\nAlthough the traffic lights are not visible in the image, it is important to note that they play a crucial role in regulating traffic flow and establishing when it is safe for vehicles to proceed. Whenever traffic light visibility is compromised, either by weather conditions or obstructions, drivers need to exercise increased caution.\n\nOn the road, there is a single traffic cone marking the boundary of the vehicle's path on the right side. This cone is an indication of potential hazards or road work in the area and may necessitate a change in the vehicle's driving path to ensure safety.\n\nAlso present is debris on the road, which could possibly be from the fallen traffic cone or other sources. Such debris poses a risk to the safety of road users, requiring them to make careful maneuvers to prevent any damage or accidents that might occur as a result."

This orange cone, by its placement on the road or near the side, might indicate maintenance work, an accident spot ahead, or another road anomaly that requires drivers to slow down or change lanes. Observing this cone requires the ego car to proceed with increased caution and potentially prepare for unexpected obstructions or to follow redirected traffic pathways.",
