        "description and explanation": "In the scene, there is a white bus on the left side of the road, positioned ahead of the ego car, facing in the same direction. The presence of the bus could affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle, like dictating its speed or influencing its lane choice, particularly if the bus stops to pick up passengers. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles located ahead at a distance; some of these are in the same lane as the ego car. These vehicles are crucial as they set the pace of the traffic flow and may necessitate the ego car to change lanes for uninterrupted progress.\n\nOn the road signage front, there's a blue circular traffic sign on the right side of the road, which indicates a mandatory right turn up ahead. This sign is essential for the ego car's route planning, ensuring it's prepared to execute the required turn.\n\nAlong the current lane of the ego vehicle, several red and white traffic cones are placed starting from near where the ego vehicle is and extending all the way to where the bus is situated. The cones imply a warning for potential road work or other obstacles, so the ego car has to keep a safe distance and possibly adjust its lane position as it maneuvers past them.\n\nA series of brown barriers are also present, lining the curbside and the area designated for turning right, which suggests some sort of demarcation possibly due to construction or flora. The significance of these barriers is in the organization of traffic flow, ensuring vehicles, including the ego car, don't enter or park in restricted zones.\n\nFinally, adjacent to the red and white traffic cones on the right, there seems to be a tripod-like wooden structure with an accompanying sign. The existence of this structure next to the cones likely signifies it's part of roadwork projects, requiring the ego car to be cautious of this potential roadside hazard."
