This improper parking of the vehicle may obstruct the lane for the autonomous vehicle, requiring it to maneuver cautiously around it. The parked car also poses a potential hazard, as it could unexpectedly move out into the road, demanding immediate attention from the autonomous vehicle's driving system. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."
