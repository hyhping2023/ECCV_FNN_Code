The ego car must be aware that this vehicle may slow down, stop, or change lanes, which will require the ego car to adjust its driving strategy accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, a white car is partially visible in the left-most lane, also moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this car is important to consider for potential lane changes or merging traffic that could affect the ego car's path.\n\nFurther ahead in the left lane, there is a bus facing a red traffic light and indicating a stop. This bus could become a temporary obstruction if it remains stationary when the ego car approaches, so the ego car will need to monitor this situation closely.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are two cyclists, one of which is closer to the ego car. Both are cycling in the same direction as the ego car. Due to their proximity to the driving lane, there is a risk if they swerve or fall, so the ego car should maintain a safe distance and be ready to react if necessary.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are no parking signs on the right side of the road, which informs drivers that they should not park along this side, potentially affecting where vehicles might stop or pull over. There are also additional mounted signs above the traffic lights that provide directions and restrictions, which may influence the ego car's lane choice and maneuvers.\n\nThe traffic light ahead is showing green for going straight and red for turning left. The ego car should adhere to these signals and be prepared for any vehicles that might be changing lanes to follow the traffic light instructions, especially if the ego car's intended path is straight or otherwise affected by these instructions.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image, which suggests that these categories do not contain any road users or items that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car in this scenario."
