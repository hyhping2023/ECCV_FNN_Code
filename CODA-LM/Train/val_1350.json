The first vehicle is a concrete mixer truck positioned directly in front of the autonomous car, occupying the majority of the driving lane. The close proximity and considerable size of the truck require the ego car to maintain a safe distance behind it to account for possible sudden stops or changes in the truck's speed.\n\nThe second vehicle is a blue truck parked on the left side of the road, adjacent to the driving lane. It is stationary; however, the ego car should remain vigilant for any unexpected movements or instances where an individual might attempt to enter the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there are overhanging branches from trees on the left side of the road, which potentially obscure visibility. While these branches do not interfere with the driving lane, they pose a risk by concealing traffic signs or signals, necessitating that the ego car proceed with extra caution.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers mentioned in the data for this particular traffic image."
