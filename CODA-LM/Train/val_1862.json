Additionally, there is a metal barrier set horizontally across the road, signaling a closed or restricted space that is inaccessible for through traffic. No other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or miscellaneous objects are present in the scene."

It is recognizable by its conical shape and reflective material. For the ego car, the presence of this traffic cone signals that there may be road work ahead, an obstruction, or a part of the lane that is closed. The ego car driver should prepare to slow down, proceed with caution, or potentially change lanes to avoid the cone and any associated hazards.",
