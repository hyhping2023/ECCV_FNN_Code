The presence of this large vehicle, which might be moving slower than other traffic, could impact the traffic flow and may necessitate that we either adjust our speed or consider changing lanes to maintain smooth traffic movement.\n\nDirectly ahead of us, in the same lane as our car, there are several cars driving in accordance with the normal traffic pattern. It is essential for our autonomous vehicle to keep a sufficient distance behind these vehicles to ensure safety and to be ready to respond to any abrupt stops or shifts in the traffic ahead.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the road, a cyclist is traveling in the same direction as the traffic. Our car must exercise caution and ensure to allocate ample room when passing the cyclist. Additionally, the car should continuously evaluate the cyclist's movement in anticipation of any potential sudden deviations from their path.\n\nFinally, there are pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right. Although they aren't an immediate hazard as they are not on the roadway, our car should continue to monitor them closely. This vigilance is necessary since there's always a chance that a pedestrian might enter the road unexpectedly, and the car must be prepared to respond appropriately. \n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers have been observed in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically designed for transporting and mixing concrete. Its appearance includes a rotating drum which is used to keep the concrete mix from hardening by constantly turning it. For the driver of the ego car, the presence of this construction vehicle could influence future driving behavior by necessitating increased caution and possibly reducing speed. Construction vehicles like this one often make sudden stops or slow maneuvers as they approach a construction site, hence it is vital for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected changes in the flow of traffic.",

Use turn signals when changing lanes to inform other road users of the ego car's intended movements."
