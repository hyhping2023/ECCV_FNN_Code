Firstly, there is a white sedan directly in front of the ego vehicle, positioned in the same lane and moving in the same direction. This situation necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe following distance and makes speed adjustments to accommodate the sedan's movements.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue car one lane to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead and appearing to move in parallel. The blue car's position must be monitored for any potential lane-changing activities that could be initiated by either the blue car or the ego vehicle.\n\nOn the right side, in the lane adjacent to the ego car, there is a green and white public bus traveling in the same direction. The presence of the bus is critical since it may stop and start frequently. This impacts the traffic flow and implies that the ego car should stay alert to the bus's merging actions and maintain a distance from any designated bus lanes.\n\nFurthermore, there is an overhead traffic light that is visible directly in front of the ego car, indicating a green signal but also displaying a no-left-turn symbol. This indication allows the ego car to continue forward but restricts any left turn maneuvers at the upcoming intersection.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the traffic image that impact the driving behavior of the ego car as per the provided data."
