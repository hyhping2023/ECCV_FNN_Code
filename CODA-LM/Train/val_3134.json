This forklift can influence the ego car's path and speed depending on whether it is moving or stationary.\n  - A tan sedan is visible in the distance, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The behavior of this sedan can impact the flow of traffic, and any sudden deceleration or lane changes could affect the ego carâ€™s actions.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - No visible traffic signs are distinguishable other than those on the traffic light structure. The lack of visible traffic signs limits the ability to assess specific rules or warnings that might impact the ego car's driving behavior.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**:\n  - There is a traffic light showing a red light for the lane in which the ego car is presumably traveling. This red light requires the ego car to stop and wait for a green signal before proceeding, affecting the car's behavior at the intersection.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - Green-topped barriers are set up along the left side of the road, separating the construction site from the road. These barriers indicate that the ego car should maintain a safe distance and not cross into the partitioned area.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects are detected in the image."

Its presence indicates active construction or maintenance work in the vicinity. For the ego car, encountering this vehicle implies the need for increased caution and reduced speed, as construction areas often have workers nearby and might require sudden stops or detours. Observing this vehicle should prompt the ego car to scan the environment for potential obstacles such as workers, debris, or altered traffic patterns.",

Avoiding any maneuvers that would bring the car close to the barriers would also be prudent."
