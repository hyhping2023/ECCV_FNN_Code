This truck is causing an obstruction that might temporarily delay the ego car's progress.\n\nVulnerable Road Users: \n- A construction worker wearing a yellow hard hat stands near the cement mixer truck on the left side of the road. Another worker is in the background. The proximity of these workers to the roadway could lead to unexpected movements into the driving lane, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and at a reduced speed.\n\nTraffic Signs: \n- To the right of the road, there is a 'No Entry' sign for vehicles, indicated by a blue circular sign with a red border and a white horizontal bar. This sign signals the ego car that entry is restricted and it might have to wait for the obstruction to be cleared or find an alternative route.\n\nTraffic Cones:\n- Red and white traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road by the cement mixer truck. These cones are indicative of ongoing construction or road work that the ego car must carefully navigate around.\n\nOther Objects: \n- There is assorted debris on the left side of the road, including construction materials and personal mobility devices. These present additional potential hazards which the ego car must be attentive to in order to safely avoid them.\n\nThe system does not report the presence of any traffic lights or barriers in the image."
