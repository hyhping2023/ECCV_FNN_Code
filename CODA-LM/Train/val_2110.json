The truck's large size and position could obscure the ego vehicle's line-of-sight and reduce its maneuverability, necessitating cautious driving and potential adjustments in speed or position when approaching or overtaking the truck.\n\n- **Traffic Lights**: A traffic light is visible ahead on the right side of the truck, showing a red signal.
