        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, we have a large truck carrying construction materials positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. The truck is notably marked, with its number plate reading 'BHM506', and has clear warning signs on its rear implying the potential carriage of hazardous substances. This presence of the truck plays a significant role in the driving environment as it occupies the lane ahead of the ego car. Consequently, this limits the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver or accelerate as it normally would, posing a challenge to the usual flow of movement.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light situated in the distance on the right-hand side of the road, which is currently displaying a red signal. This red light is crucial for the traffic management in the scene, as it mandates that the ego car, along with any other vehicles sharing its lane, must come to a complete stop. The vehicles are required to wait for the light to change to green before they can safely proceed. This ensures the orderly flow of cross-traffic and promotes safety at the intersection.\n\nNo other road users or traffic elements such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers or miscellaneous objects are reported in this scene, which allows for focused attention on the immediate obstacles presented by the large truck and the red traffic light."

The presence of this vehicle indicates active construction work in the area, which can lead to sudden stops or reduced speeds. This requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and stay alert for potential stops or debris that might fall from the truck.",

In a traffic scenario, the presence of a bus can significantly influence driving behavior. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance when behind a bus due to its frequent stops and the potential for passengers to disembark at unexpected locations. Additionally, overtaking a bus should be done with caution, ensuring there is sufficient clear space ahead due to the bus's length and potential to obstruct the view of other smaller vehicles on the road.",

Proceed only when the traffic light turns green and it's safe to do so."
