A white car directly in front of the ego car, positioned in the center of the lane, appearing to be stationary or moving slowly. This vehicle directly influences the following distance and speed of the ego car.\n2. Several cars in the oncoming traffic lanes to the left, in motion. These vehicles do not directly affect the ego vehicle's immediate driving decisions but must be monitored for situational awareness.\n3. A red car in the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, also appearing to be stationary or moving slowly. The red car could potentially change lanes, so the ego car should monitor this vehicle for any sudden movements.\n\nThere are also several non-vehicle objects influencing the driving behavior:\n- A directional sign overhead, appearing to indicate lane directions with arrows. This sign provides information about the lane usage ahead, guiding the ego car to choose the correct lane for its intended route.\n- The traffic light ahead is green, indicating that the ego car can proceed if the way is clear.\n- Orange traffic cones placed in a row on the right side of the road, starting from the ego car's lane and extending forward, indicating some form of roadwork or closed lane ahead. This obstruction requires the ego car to either slow down or change lanes to avoid the closed lane.\n- Yellow and black barriers are visible on the right, potentially indicating a road closure or diversion. These barriers signal that the ego car must stay in its current lane or change to a lane to the left to continue moving forward."

Monitoring the red car on the right for any potential lane changes is also advised. Overall, maintaining a moderate speed and situational awareness is critical in this scenario to react safely to all potential road changes and the behavior of other vehicles."
