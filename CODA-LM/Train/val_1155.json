        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, various road users and objects can be seen, requiring diverse considerations for safe autonomous driving.\n\nStarting with vehicles, there are two distinct observations: First, a white van situated on the leftmost part of the image appears either stationary or moving very slowly. This presence on the road necessitates caution, especially if the van intends to merge into or enter the traffic lane of our autonomous vehicle. It's critical to maintain a safe distance or be prepared to slow down to avoid any potential hazards. Second, there are multiple cars ahead in the same lane as our autonomous vehicle, seemingly in a traffic queue. This situation signals the need for our vehicle to be mindful of the flow of traffic and adjust its speed accordingly to keep a safe following distance, ensuring smooth navigation through the traffic.\n\nConcerning traffic signs, two notable signs have been identified. A blue circular sign displaying a white arrow pointing upwards is observed on the right side of the road, indicating that the lane our vehicle is in must proceed straight ahead. This sign provides clear direction on the mandatory movement for our lane. Adjacent to this, a white circular sign with the inscription '80t' suggests a weight restriction of 80 tons for vehicles using the road ahead. While this may not directly influence our autonomous vehicle's behavior unless it's notably heavy, it remains an essential piece of information for understanding possible heavy vehicle traffic and restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic cone is visible at the bottom edge of the image towards the right, marking the boundary of the driving lane. This cone serves as a warning to our vehicle to stay within the designated lane and to be vigilant of any potential hazards or work zones that might be ahead, ensuring the safety of the vehicle and its surroundings.\n\nLastly, metal barriers are noted to be lining the median strip of the road, effectively separating the opposing lanes of traffic. These barriers play a crucial role in demarcating the road and safeguarding against accidental or intentional entry into the opposite lane, thereby preventing possible collisions.\n\nIn this traffic scene, no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects have been identified, allowing the focus of autonomous driving adjustments to be on vehicles, traffic signs, traffic cones, and barriers as described. These elements collectively inform the autonomous vehicle's driving behavior, ensuring it remains prudent, responsive, and in compliance with road regulations for the safety of all road users."

Additionally, use caution to not hit the traffic cone on the right side of the lane."
