This excavator is located off to the right side of the road, positioned beyond perimeter fencing. It is parallel to the road with its arm extended towards the ground, and the bucket is resting near the base of a tree. Currently, the excavator appears to be stationary and doesn't pose an immediate threat to road traffic. However, the ego car should keep monitoring the excavator due to its proximity to the road and the potential for it to move. No other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or objects are observed in the scene."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a yellow construction vehicle, specifically an excavator. Excavators are heavy construction equipment consisting of a boom, dipper (or stick), bucket, and cab on a rotating platform known as the 'house.' The house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels. They are used for a variety of tasks such as digging trenches, holes, and foundations, as well as for demolition, heavy lifting, grading, landscaping, and mining. The presence of this construction vehicle on or near the roadway indicates potential nearby construction work. This could influence the future driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating reduced speed, increased awareness, and possible detours or lane changes to accommodate safety measures and traffic management strategies typically implemented in construction zones.",
