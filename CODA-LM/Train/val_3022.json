The vehicle is illuminated, particularly at the rear, indicating active engagement in work. Localized around its body are several clear safety and warning indicators, such as reflective stripes and lights, to caution other drivers on its operational presence. This machinery's presence on the road necessitates that the ego car and other vehicles in its vicinity must maintain a safe distance and possibly reduce speed to safely navigate around the potential obstruction or slow-moving traffic caused by the vehicle's operations.",

Continuous monitoring of the truck's and worker's movements is advised. Preparing to reduce speed or stop may be necessary depending on the truck's and worker's behavior. Additionally, be ready to switch lanes if it appears safe and possible to do so, ensuring no sudden maneuvers that might startle the worker or disrupt nearby traffic."
