The presence of this vehicle on or near the roadway can influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating caution and potentially a reduction in speed to safely navigate around the area, especially if any part of the vehicle encroaches into the roadway or if there are signs of active construction. It may also indicate temporary traffic signs or changes in traffic patterns ahead.",

Avoid sudden acceleration, braking, or steering inputs that could cause loss of control. Additionally, pay close attention to potential hydroplaning risks if there are significant puddles or standing water on the road surface."
