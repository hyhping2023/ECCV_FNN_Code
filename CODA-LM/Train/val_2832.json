Concrete mixer trucks are used for transporting ready-mixed concrete by keeping the concrete agitated during transit to prevent it from setting. The position and size of the truck may influence the ego car's driving decisions by indicating the need to reduce speed and ensure a safe passing distance, particularly in narrow or busy urban roads, like the one shown. The truck's presence may also suggest potential nearby construction activity, prompting the ego car driver to be extra cautious of sudden stops or debris on the road.",
