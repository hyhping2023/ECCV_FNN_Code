There is a black SUV directly in front, either stationary or moving slowly, in the same lane as the ego vehicle, impacting its speed and following distance. Several cars are identified in the oncoming traffic lane, moving in the opposite direction; while they contribute to situational awareness, they do not affect the ego vehicle's immediate driving decisions since they are in a separate lane. Additionally, a white van is present in the adjacent left lane, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, important to monitor for potential lane changes.\n\nA directional road sign next to the black SUV indicates a junction or turn-off ahead to the right, signaling possible maneuvers by vehicles, which could influence the ego vehicle's route or lane choice.\n\nTraffic cones are also observed on the side of the road, marking an area not to be entered, clearly delineating where the ego car should not drive. These elements collectively inform the driving decisions and situational awareness needed for safely navigating the road."
