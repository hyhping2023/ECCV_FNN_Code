The presence and behavior of this vehicle directly influence the speed and following distance of the ego car.\n\nThere are two traffic signs visible. The first is a round red sign with '4.0' displayed on it, attached to the bridge overhead, indicating a height restriction of 4 meters. This sign is critical for the ego car if it were taller than the limitation, particularly affecting trucks and over-height vehicles. The second sign consists of diagonal red and white striped warning signs on the left, attached to barricades, which indicate roadworks or obstructions ahead and guide the ego car to keep right.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed to the left of the ego vehicle, creating a channel between the construction barricades and the cones. This coned-off area likely indicates construction or road maintenance work, necessitating the ego car to reduce speed and maintain a safe distance from the cones.\n\nRed and white striped barricades are present to the left of the lane, surrounding what seems to be a construction zone. These temporary barriers indicate that part of the road or sidewalk is closed for work and may influence traffic flow, cautioning the ego car to stay in the open lane.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yellow object resembling a dustbin on the sidewalk to the right. It appears to be stationary and does not impose an immediate threat, but the ego car should monitor it as objects on the side could potentially enter the roadway.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other categories of objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
