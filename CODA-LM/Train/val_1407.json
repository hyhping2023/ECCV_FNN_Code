This vehicle is a red-colored one, located approximately 20 meters ahead in the same driving lane with its brake lights lit. The illuminated brake lights suggest that the vehicle may be decelerating or approaching a halt, prompting the ego car to be ready to slow down or stop in order to keep a safe distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic light situated on the right side of the road, displaying a red signal. This red light is a directive for the traffic moving in the direction of the ego car to come to a stop. It means that the ego car should be preparing to stop at the intersection if it has not already done so.\n\nLastly, a barrier or sidewalk is present on the right side of the road, creating a partition between the roadway and the adjacent property or pedestrian pathways. The ego car is advised to remain in its lane and ensure a safe gap from the barrier to steer clear of any potential obstacles or pedestrians that might be close to the driving path. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, or other objects reported in this scene that affect the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle."
