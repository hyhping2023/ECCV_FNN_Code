Additionally, there is a lighted overhead gantry sign at a distance, which likely displays traffic-related information or instructions. This sign is important as it may contain speed limits or lane usage instructions that the ego car needs to follow. Furthermore, there is a makeshift barrier on the road, consisting of a row of bicycles laid out horizontally, approximately in the lane of the ego car. This barrier suggests a closed or restricted section of the road that the ego car cannot pass through. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image."
