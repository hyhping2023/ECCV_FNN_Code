The truck is noticeable by its reflective markings and its rear lights being illuminated, which suggests that it's either moving or getting ready to move. The truck's position is critical as it affects the ego vehicle's driving decisions; the driver of the ego car must maintain an appropriate following distance and may need to consider overtaking or changing lanes, depending on how fast the truck is going and what the ego car is planning to do."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a large commercial truck, prominently featuring high-visibility reflective markings and a series of red and white diagonal stripes on the tailgate intended to enhance its visibility and warn other drivers of its presence. This heavy vehicle influences the driving scenario by potentially slowing down the traffic flow, requiring increased following distance, and necessitating extra caution during maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes due to its size and the limited visibility around it.",

If the truck's speed is significantly lower than the flow of traffic or if the ego car intends to speed up, it should consider safely changing lanes when possible. Additionally, the ego vehicle's headlights should be on to ensure visibility to other road users, and speeds should be adjusted appropriately for the wet road conditions."
