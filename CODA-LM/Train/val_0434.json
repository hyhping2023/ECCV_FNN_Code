The motion blur makes it difficult to ascertain their exact positions and speeds. However, the presence of these vehicles is critical for determining the ego car's lane choice, following distance, and any potential merging actions that may be required.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian observed at the bottom left of the image, who appears to be standing on the sidewalk near a crosswalk. The pedestrian's location near the crosswalk indicates a possibility that they may enter the roadway. Consequently, the ego car must monitor the pedestrian closely to ensure it can yield appropriately if the pedestrian decides to cross. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
