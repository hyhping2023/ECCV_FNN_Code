This red light mandates that the ego car must come to a stop at the intersection to comply with traffic laws and maintain safety.\n\nFurthermore, there are multiple traffic cones aligned on the right lane, marking a construction or work area adjacent to the utility truck. These cones serve to reduce the available driving space and guide traffic to potentially move to the left lane, steering clear of the work zone."
