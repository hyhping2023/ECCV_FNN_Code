Adjacent to it, on the right, is an orange wheeled construction vehicle, potentially moving or stationary, contributing to the ongoing roadwork and affecting driving paths.\n\nNearby, construction workers are visible, walking close to the vehicle operation area. Their unpredictable movements necessitate cautious driving and a low speed from the ego car.\n\nDiagonal placement of multiple orange and white traffic cones across the intersection creates a visual barrier, directing traffic away from the construction zone due to the temporary traffic flow change.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene."
