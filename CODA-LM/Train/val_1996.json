The vehicle is distinguishable by the Chinese characters and details on its side panel. The presence of this vehicle is significant as its size and proximity may reduce the visibility for the ego car. Additionally, there is a possibility that the commercial vehicle could merge or turn, which would influence the driving path of the ego car. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

It is part of the vehicle's exhaust system, used to direct exhaust gases away from the engine and into the atmosphere. The presence of this exhaust pipe indicates that the truck likely has a diesel engine, as diesel trucks typically require such fittings to handle larger volumes of exhaust gases. For driving behavior, the ego car should maintain distance due to the potential release of exhaust gases, which could impair visibility or air quality near the truck.",
