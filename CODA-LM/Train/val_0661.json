        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, there are several elements to note:\n\nFirstly, vehicles include a dark-colored SUV, directly ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle. It is important for the autonomous system to keep a safe distance from the SUV to anticipate if braking or a lane change will be needed. Additionally, a white utility vehicle is parked on the side of the road with a person positioned behind it, encroaching on the right lane. This could lead to a possible obstruction, and the autonomous system must remain alert to the potential hazard, possibly requiring evasive action.\n\nThere is a vulnerable road user present, specifically a person wearing a high-visibility vest behind the parked utility vehicle. Because this person is handling objects and might step onto the road, the autonomous system should be ready to slow down or switch lanes if necessary to ensure safety.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a sign with Chinese characters can be seen on the right side of the road. While its message isn't clear from the image, it might hold vital information about upcoming road conditions or rules. The ego vehicle will need to inspect it more closely upon approach.\n\nTraffic cones are situated in a row, signaling the closure of the rightmost lane. This informs the ego vehicle's decision to remain in its current lane and avoid attempts to merge into the obstructed lane.\n\nLastly, there are yellow drum-shaped barriers near the traffic cones on the road's edge. These barriers act as an additional warning against entering the closed-off right lane. \n\nNo traffic lights or other types of barriers are reported in the image."
