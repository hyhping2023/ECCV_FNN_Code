The ego car will need to maintain a safe following distance from the sedan, staying alert for any sudden braking that could occur.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small dog crossing the road from left to right, about halfway across the lane in which the ego car is traveling. This scenario requires the ego car to possibly slow down or come to a stop to ensure that the dog crosses safely, as it poses a risk to both the animal and road users.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would impact the ego car's driving behavior. Therefore, the focus should primarily be on the moving sedan and the crossing dog to ensure safety and compliance with traffic conditions."
