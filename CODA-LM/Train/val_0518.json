        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are three vehicles highlighted with specific descriptions and implications for the autonomous vehicle's driving decisions. Firstly, a white sedan is positioned on the leftmost lane, slightly ahead of the autonomous vehicle, which may affect lane choice decisions as it could either change lanes or continue straight. Secondly, a dark-colored sedan is directly in front of the autonomous vehicle within the same lane, influencing the following distance and speed that needs to be maintained for safety. Lastly, a gray van is observed on the rightmost lane, aligned parallel to the autonomous vehicle, potentially indicating an intention to merge into the lane of the autonomous vehicle, requiring adjustments in speed to ensure a safe merge.\n\nAdditionally, overhead directional traffic signs are present, indicating various destinations and lane designations. These signs are crucial as they guide the autonomous vehicle regarding the upcoming road configurations and anticipate other vehicles' movements in response to these directions.\n\nFurthermore, there are orange traffic cones on the rightmost lane, signaling a closed lane or ongoing road work. This setup indicates potential obstructions and necessitates a vigilance for merging hazards, as it hints at the need for vehicles, including the autonomous vehicle, to shift lanes to navigate safely around the indicated road work area.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects that would impact the autonomous vehicle's navigation decisions in the current view."

Traffic cones are used to signal areas of the road that are hazardous or under construction, redirecting traffic flow or indicating temporary driving restrictions. For the ego car in this traffic scenario, the presence of traffic cones should prompt the driver to decrease speed and prepare for potential redirection or lane shifts, ensuring safety and adherence to road work indications.",

In this context, they are placed beside a parked van, likely indicating that this segment of the road might temporarily be blocked for routine maintenance or loading activities. The influence on driving behavior would be that the ego car needs to remain in its lane and not attempt to pass the van on the right side, maintaining safety by giving space to the blocked-off area.",
