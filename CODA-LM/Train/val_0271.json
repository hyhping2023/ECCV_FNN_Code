The presence of the cyclist requires the ego car to maintain a safe distance since cyclists can be unpredictable and may need to swerve suddenly.\n\nFurther ahead on the right, there is another cyclist traveling in the same direction as the ego car. This cyclist's varying speed or road positioning could influence the ego car's driving behavior, possibly requiring the car to overtake with a wider berth or adjust its speed.\n\nAdditionally, a series of red and white traffic cones are placed along the left edge of the ego car's lane. These cones indicate that there might be road work or a lane closure ahead, which would mean the ego car might need to merge to the right or adjust its lane positioning accordingly.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
