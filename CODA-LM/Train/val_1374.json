The SUV's proximity and potential for unexpected actions such as lane changes or sudden slowing down necessitates that the ego car maintains a safe distance and keeps a close watch on this vehicle. \n\nIn addition, there are pedestrians walking down the center of the road, one with a pushcart and one with a dog. Their presence in the middle of the road poses a risk for sudden movements, requiring the ego car to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. \n\nThere is also a cyclist on the right, riding along the row of parked cars. The cyclist's position suggests a potential for sudden swerving or stopping to avoid opening car doors or pedestrians, which calls for increased caution from the ego car. \n\nFurthermore, there are yellow and black traffic cones on the right, separating the road from a line of parked vehicles. These cones indicate that the ego car should not move into the space next to the parked cars and must continue in its current lane. \n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
