Firstly, there is a silver SUV located on the left side of the ego car, slightly ahead and in the adjacent lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of this SUV is important as its proximity and relative speed may affect the ego car's decisions regarding lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, there are several vehicles ahead, positioned in the same lane as the ego car and moving in the same direction. The behavior of these vehicles is crucial as it will influence the ego car's speed and the distance it needs to maintain from them.\n\nLastly, there is a series of orange traffic cones on the right side of the road, arranged in a diagonal line across the merging lane. These cones indicate a lane closure or road works ahead, necessitating that the ego vehicle stays in its lane and maintains a safe distance from the cones to avoid the reduced road width.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the scene that need to be accounted for by the autonomous driving system."

It is typically cone-shaped, made of a material like plastic or rubber, and is brightly colored, often orange and white, to ensure high visibility. For the ego car in this scenario, the presence of this traffic cone influences driving behavior by indicating that the driver should remain alert and possibly adjust the vehicle's path to avoid the hazard or restricted area marked by the cone.",
