This indicates the SUV is stopped due to the red traffic light ahead, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe stopping distance.\n2. A blue truck carrying goods on the left side of the ego vehicle is also stopped at the intersection. This suggests that the intersection is currently active, and the ego vehicle should follow the stop signal.\n3. A silver van on the right side, stopping near the crosswalk, parallel to the ego vehicle. The presence of this van indicates that multiple lanes of traffic are adhering to the stop signal at the intersection.\n\nThere is a red traffic light visible straight ahead. This indicates that all vehicles, including the ego vehicle, must remain stopped until the signal changes to green.\n\nOrange traffic cones are placed on the left side of the road, in front of the intersection, which may indicate a potential lane closure or hazard, possibly due to construction or an obstacle ahead. The ego vehicle may need to adjust lane positioning if directed by road signs or traffic personnel.\n\nWhite and red striped barriers are set up along the median of the intersection, potentially indicating a work zone or lane division. These barriers guide vehicles safely through the intersection and may affect lane choice and navigation through the area."
