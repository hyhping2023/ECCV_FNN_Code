        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene observed, a few important road signals and modifications are apparent affecting navigation. Firstly, a \"No parking sign\" is positioned to the left of the road beside a building at an intersection. The presence of this sign indicates that vehicles are prohibited from parking in that area, and consequently, the ego vehicle should avoid stopping or parking along that particular section of the curb.\n\nAdditionally, the ego vehicle is faced with a traffic light exhibiting a red stop signal directly ahead. This red signal requires the ego vehicle to come to a complete stop at the intersection and wait for the light to switch to green before continuing its journey.\n\nFurthermore, there is a lineup of multiple orange traffic cones set up on the right-hand side of the lane as it approaches the intersection. These cones likely denote ongoing roadwork or a temporary obstruction, prompting the redirecting of traffic to avoid the area on the right, which could signal a lane closure or narrowing.\n\nLastly, a barrier with red and white stripes is visible alongside the traffic cones on the right side of the road. This barrier further emphasizes a no-entry or no-exit zone, adding to the guidance provided by the cones about where the ego vehicle should not venture."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, characterized by its bright orange color and a reflective strip around its top. Traffic cones are commonly used to channel traffic flow safely around hazards or construction areas, to delineate traffic lanes, or to signal areas that are off-limits to vehicles. In this rainy night setting, the reflective strip enhances visibility, ensuring drivers are aware of changes in normal traffic patterns or specific areas to avoid. This awareness aids in preventing accidents and maintaining smooth traffic flow.",

Bollards are implemented in traffic settings to control road traffic, preventing entry into restricted areas or protecting pedestrians and buildings from vehicle impacts. They can be permanent or temporary and are often found near the edges of traffic lanes, sidewalks, and within parking lots. In this context, the presence of a bollard may indicate areas not accessible to vehicles, guiding the ego car to stay clear of such zones, thereby enhancing safety and directing traffic efficiently.",

The cone is typically bright orange with a white reflective band to increase visibility, especially during night or in low light conditions. In this driving scenario, the presence of this traffic cone suggests that part of the lane or road ahead may be closed for construction, an incident, or another reason.
