The truck's size and position directly in front of the ego car limit visibility and maneuverability, potentially necessitating a lane change or a reduction in speed to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there is a set of traffic lights ahead displaying red. This red light signifies that the ego car must stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding, thereby influencing the immediate driving decision."

Such vehicles are used in transporting freshly mixed concrete from a batch plant to construction sites. The presence of this type of vehicle on the road indicates nearby construction activity. It may influence driving behavior by reducing the speed of the traffic flow, requiring vehicles behind it to maintain a safe following distance, and to be ready for sudden stops or slower speeds, especially given the size and operational nature of the vehicle.",
