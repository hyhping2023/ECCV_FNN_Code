        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image observed, several key road users and traffic elements are present, impacting the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nVehicles comprise a white SUV parked on the right side of the road, facing the direction of the ego car. The presence of this SUV may obstruct the view or the lane for the ego car if it decides to move, necessitating caution. Additionally, a gold sedan is observed driving on the opposite side of the road, moving away from the ego car. This sedan does not directly influence the driving behavior of the ego car since it is situated on the opposite lane, suggesting no immediate action is required concerning this vehicle.\n\nAmong the vulnerable road users, there is an elderly pedestrian walking a dog, who is crossing the road in front of the ego car. This pedestrian has the right of way, compelling the ego car to yield to ensure their safety, thus significantly influencing the immediate driving decisions to be made by the ego car.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, thereâ€™s a parking sign on the right side of the road indicating a parking area. This sign communicates the availability of parking spots, which might be of interest to the ego car if there is an intention to park nearby. It provides a point of consideration for potential parking needs but does not affect immediate driving behavior.\n\nIn this scene, there are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that influence the ego car's driving behavior. This selective presence of road users and traffic signs play a crucial role in dictating the necessary actions and awareness the ego car must maintain."
