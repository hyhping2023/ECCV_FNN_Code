            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, which appears to be a cement mixer. It is a large, heavy vehicle typically used in building and construction projects to mix cement, sand, and other aggregates to form concrete. For the ego vehicle, the presence of this construction vehicle directly ahead requires increased caution and reduced speed to safely navigate around it. The vehicle's large size and potential for making sudden stops or discharging materials also contribute to the need for maintaining a safe following distance.",

Be cautious of potential debris falling from the truck and remain vigilant for any vehicles that may suddenly enter the lane from the parked position. In light of the wet road conditions, reduce speed accordingly to prevent loss of traction, and avoid sudden lane changes due to the concrete barriers. Prepare for the possibility that traffic may be moving slower than usual due to the large vehicle ahead and the road conditions."
