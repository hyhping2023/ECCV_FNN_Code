The ego car will need to respond to this by maintaining a safe distance and possibly preparing to come to a halt or decelerate.\n\nSecondly, a green car is noticed in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Although this car is moving and not currently obstructing the ego car's path, it demands attention for any possible lane shifting or unforeseen actions that could influence the ego car.\n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian crossing sign is visible on the right side of the road, which serves as a warning for the possible presence of pedestrians. This necessitates the ego car to be vigilant and ready to stop should there be people intending to cross.\n\nOn the right side of the road, orange traffic cones signal the presence of a work zone or an obstruction, hinting the ego car to proceed with caution and be prepared for alterations in the flow of traffic or potential hazards.\n\nLastly, to complement the alert provided by the traffic cones, temporary barriers are in place on the right, outlining the work zone or obstruction. The barriers further indicate that the ego car might need to reduce speed or switch lanes to navigate the situation safely."

Monitor the green car in the left lane for any lane changes that might affect your lane. Continue to observe the road conditions and drive in accordance with traffic regulations while being prepared for any unexpected changes due to the roadwork."
