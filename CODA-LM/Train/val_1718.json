This positioning could reduce the lateral space available to the ego car, requiring it to maintain or adjust its position to avoid a potential side-by-side situation. Additionally, a white sedan is visible ahead in the left lane, traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The presence of this sedan should be monitored in case it changes lanes or slows down, possibly necessitating a change in speed or lane by the ego vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, traffic lights ahead are currently green for all lanes, indicating that the ego vehicle can proceed forward. However, continuous monitoring of the lights is necessary in case they change. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Additionally, watch for any possible hazards that may arise from the behavior of surrounding vehicles."
