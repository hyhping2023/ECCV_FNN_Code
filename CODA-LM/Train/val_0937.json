This vehicle position requires the ego car to be prepared to change lanes to avoid a close encounter. Additionally, there is potential construction activity ahead on the right side of the road, indicated by the presence of an excavator and a yellow truck. These construction vehicles could cause obstructions or traffic delays, so the ego car should reduce speed and be ready for varying traffic conditions.\n\nSeveral construction workers are also in the vicinity of these vehicles, with some on the road and others near the sidewalk. Their presence increases the risk of sudden pedestrian movement into the vehicle's path, which means the ego car should remain highly alert and slow down accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, there are traffic cones lined up, marking the construction zone and partially blocking the rightmost lane. These cones suggest that there might be a lane closure or ongoing roadwork, necessitating that the ego car merge left if needed and maintain cautious driving as it proceeds."
