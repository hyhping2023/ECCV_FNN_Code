Firstly, there's a light-colored bus in motion on the left, occupying the leftmost lane and positioned at pedestrian crossing lines. Its large size and potential sudden stops for passenger pickups or drop-offs influence speed and lane choice for the ego car. Additionally, a silver sedan in the rightmost lane, just ahead of the ego vehicle, appears angled as if preparing to move off or change lanes. This necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, warning signs indicating roadwork or lane closures ahead are visible roadside, alongside a no-entry sign for the closed-off lane on the left. These signs alert the ego vehicle to potential hazards or traffic pattern changes, requiring reduced speed and heightened awareness.\n\nAlthough the traffic lights are not visible, orange and white traffic cones mark lane separation and closure of the left lane where roadwork is occurring. These cones direct the ego car to stay in the current or rightward lanes. Yellow and black striped barriers around a construction zone on the left clearly mark the restricted area, signifying lane closures and work zones, instructing the ego vehicle to avoid the left lane and proceed with caution.\n\nFinally, no vulnerable road users or other objects are present in the image."
