            "description and explanation": "A traffic cone is a cone-shaped marker that is often placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. It is typically orange or red with white horizontal striping and is made of a lightweight material like plastic or rubber. This traffic cone indicates an area of the road should be avoided, possibly due to road work or a hazard. As a driver, the presence of the traffic cone should alert you to slow down, proceed with caution, and if necessary, move to another lane to safely navigate past the coned-off area.",

Additionally, attention should be given to the traffic cones to the right, ensuring the ego car remains in its lane and prepares for potential road narrowing or hazards."
