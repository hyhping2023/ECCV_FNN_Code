The presence of the truck is significant, as it may carry out maneuvers within its lane or potentially slow down due to the upcoming intersection, which would necessitate the ego car to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nAhead on the road, there are multiple vehicles stopped at a traffic light, occupying all available lanes. This congestion suggests that the traffic light is currently red, which means the ego car will also be required to halt at the intersection.\n\nOver the intersection, there are directional signs that provide lane-specific directionsâ€”indicating that the left lane is designated for turning, while the right lanes are for going straight. This information is crucial for the ego car to position itself correctly, based on its intended route, as it approaches the intersection.\n\nThe traffic light in view, positioned overhead at a distance, is displaying a red signal. This directs the ego car to come to a complete stop at the intersection and to remain stationary until the signal changes.\n\nTo the right side, in front of the stopped vehicles, there is an array of orange traffic cones. These cones likely denote ongoing road works or a lane closure, signaling that caution is needed and that the ego car may need to merge into another lane to safely navigate past the indicated area."
