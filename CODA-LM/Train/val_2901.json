It features a large, yellow body with reflective safety markings, including orange and white chequered patterns, to enhance its visibility. The rear shows components typical of heavy construction equipment, such as a robust chassis and hydraulic mechanisms. For the ego car, the presence of this vehicle indicates nearby construction activity and necessitates increased caution. The ego car driver should be prepared for unexpected stops or slow-moving traffic, adhere to any temporary traffic signs or directions, and maintain a safe distance from the construction vehicle to avoid accidents.",
