            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, recognizable by its large rotating drum used to mix and transport concrete. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates nearby construction activity. As these trucks often move slower and make frequent stops to offload concrete, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected stops or reduced speeds. It is also crucial to be vigilant for any debris that may fall off this type of vehicle and to be cautious of its wide turning radius, especially in traffic.",

As overtaking might be necessary, the ego car should prepare for a lane change by checking the positions of vehicles in the left lanes and signaling intentions clearly. Due to the indistinct traffic lights, the ego car should approach with caution and be prepared to stop if necessary. Awareness of the motorcyclist on the right when changing lanes is critical, ensuring a safe maneuver without endangering the rider."
