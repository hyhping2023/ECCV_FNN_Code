Directly ahead of the ego car, there are several cars oriented in the same direction, indicative of the current traffic flow and potential movement. The ego car must remain cautious, keeping a safe distance and be prepared to stop if needed.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there are pedestrians on the crosswalk in front of the ego vehicle. Some are facing towards the vehicle, while others are walking across. The ego vehicle must give way to the pedestrians by either stopping or slowing down to ensure their safety.\n\nThe traffic lights in the scene include a red traffic light at the intersection. This commands the ego vehicle to stop completely and wait for the light to become green before continuing through the intersection.\n\nOn the left side of the intersection, there are yellow and orange traffic cones, suggestive of a construction area or a lane closure, requiring the ego car to be vigilant and ready to adjust to changes in lane availability. There are also temporary green barriers along the left side of the road, signalling the presence of construction or road work. These barriers indicate the ego car should be alert to potential new road signs or altered traffic patterns."
