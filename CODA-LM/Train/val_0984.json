        "description and explanation": "In the scene observed, there are two vehicles significantly influencing the ego car's navigation and decision-making. Firstly, a yellow construction vehicle is situated directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car, likely moving slowly. The presence of this vehicle necessitates that the ego car either slows down or considers a lane change to bypass it. Alongside the construction vehicle is a white sedan to its left, just ahead. The specific positioning of the sedan is crucial for the ego car's potential lane-change decision to the left in order to pass the construction vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red traffic light visible above the construction vehicle. The red light mandates that the ego car, along with other road users, come to a stop and wait until it turns green to proceed.\n\nNo other road users such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are observed in the traffic scene, indicating lesser complexity in the immediate driving environment beyond the noted vehicles and traffic light."

            "description and explanation": "The object is a yellow construction vehicle, commonly used in civil engineering and construction projects. It features an open cab housing the driver and has large, heavy-duty wheels suitable for all types of terrain. The presence of this vehicle in a traffic scenario usually indicates ongoing construction nearby or the transportation of construction material. For the ego car, this means increased caution is warranted. The driver should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle.",

Overtaking should not be attempted due to the current traffic light state and potential uncertainty about the intentions of the construction vehicle and the other sedan in the left lane. Therefore, it is advisable to maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle until the traffic light turns green and it is clear whether the vehicle will move or remain stationary, at which point the ego car can reassess the situation for possible overtaking, if it's safe and legal to do so."
