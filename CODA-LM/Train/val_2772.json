In the vehicles category, there are multiple cars parked on either side of a wet street. Notably, one of these cars has its rear lights on, signaling it may soon leave its parking space, and the autonomous vehicle, or ego car, should be ready to yield to it. Additionally, a red car appears to be in motion in the center of the image, heading towards the ego car, representing a potential oncoming traffic hazard that requires attention.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a pedestrian donned in a dark jacket and jeans, walking from the parking lot towards the street on the right side. This pedestrian may step onto the street, prompting the ego car to be prepared to halt if necessary. Furthermore, a black dog is present in the street on the left, with its back towards the ego vehicle. Due to its unpredictable nature, the dog may necessitate the ego car to decelerate or stop to avert any danger.\n\nWhile there are neither traffic signs nor traffic lights, cones, or barriers identified in the image, there is an additional factor to consider: a substantial snow pile situated on the parking lot's right side. Such an obstruction has the potential to reduce visibility for the ego car and other road users, hence the ego car will need to account for this impediment in its driving strategy."
