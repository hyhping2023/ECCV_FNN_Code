Directly ahead of the ego car, within the same lane and approximately one car length away, is a silver sedan. The ego car must monitor the distance to this sedan carefully to maintain safety and be prepared to adjust its speed should the sedan slow down or halt. To the right of the ego car and slightly ahead is a white car; the ego car should be aware of this vehicle's movements as it may change lanes or influence the ego car's decisions if it needs to switch to the right lane. \n\nOverhead, there are directional signs on gantries which provide guidance regarding exits and lane directions. These signs will inform the ego car's lane choice well in advance of upcoming junctions or exits. The traffic lights visible are green, indicating that the ego car and other traffic can proceed, yet vigilance is necessary to respond to any changes in the conditions ahead.\n\nTo the right side of the road, bright orange traffic cones demarcate an area off-limits, likely due to construction or a temporary blockage. These cones serve as a guideline for the ego car to remain within its lane boundaries and avoid the cordoned-off area.\n\nAdditionally, there are red and white barriers separating the pedestrian walkway from the road on the right, ensuring that vehicles such as the ego car remain in the roadway and do not crossover into the pedestrian area.\n\nThe scene does not contain any vulnerable road users or other objects that would otherwise influence the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
