It is positioned in the center of the right-most lane, slightly towards the right side. This is significant for our autonomous driving system as it needs to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or lane position in response to the motorcycle's actions. Secondly, there is a barrier on the right side of the road. While it does not intrude on our vehicle's lane, it does reduce the width of the shoulder. This barrier could indicate potential roadwork or an area to avoid, so our vehicle should stay alert for any instructions or shifts in the drive path."

The ego car must decrease speed and proceed cautiously, considering potential changes in road surface and the proximity of the barrier to the driving lane. It may also be required to follow specific detour signs or altered traffic patterns due to the barrier, ensuring the safety and smooth operation of the traffic in this zone.",
