Their presence is important for deciding how the ego vehicle maneuvers the intersection, as it must consider right-of-way and movement timing. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the right-hand side, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The cyclist must be cautiously accounted for by the driver to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential risks. Furthermore, a traffic light displaying a red signal indicates that the ego vehicle is required to stop and wait for the green signal to proceed. Red and white traffic cones are also present, demarcating a section of the road that is off-limits, possibly due to construction or road hazards, guiding the ego vehicle to steer clear of that area. There are no other notable objects, traffic signs, or barriers reported in the image."

The vehicle must also look out for the cyclist on the right and ensure safe passing distance when the traffic starts to move. The ego vehicle should also note the location of the traffic cones to avoid entering the restricted area and maintain vigilance for any possible road users that might emerge from that area. Overall, defensive driving and adherence to traffic signals are required."
