This large vehicle may obstruct visibility for the ego car, and hence it is crucial to adjust speed or even change lanes if necessary to ensure a safe following distance and maintain road safety.

It appears large and equipped with bright front lights and possibly additional safety features to enhance visibility. The presence of this vehicle indicates there may be active construction or road work ahead. This requires the ego car to potentially slow down, watch for signage indicating detours or lane closures, and proceed with heightened caution to accommodate unexpected obstructions or personnel on the road.",
