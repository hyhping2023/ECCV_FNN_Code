Additionally, several cars are parked on the right side of the road further ahead, with an oncoming black car in the opposite lane. These parked vehicles reduce the available lane width, and the oncoming car means the ego car must stay in its lane.\n\nTwo pedestrians are walking along the roadside to the left, with one holding an umbrella. These pedestrians are close to the driving lane, requiring the ego car to be cautious in case they step onto the roadway.\n\nOrange traffic cones are set up in a line, separating the driving lane from the shoulder where the pedestrians are walking. These cones indicate a work zone or a temporary reroute that restricts the driving path and requires the ego car to proceed with caution.\n\nLastly, there is a guardrail running along the right side of the road, with foliage behind it. This barrier defines the boundary of the driving space on the right and restricts road width for maneuvering.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects are present in this image."
