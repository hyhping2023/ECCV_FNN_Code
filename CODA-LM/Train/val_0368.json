Firstly, there is a vehicle parked or standing at the end of the road on the right-hand side, which currently does not have its brake lights on. This vehicle doesn't pose an immediate threat to the ego car but should be kept under observation in case it unexpectedly moves onto the road.\n\nAdditionally, there is a directional sign visible far ahead on the side of the road. This sign indicates directions to different places, which, while not affecting immediate driving behavior, serves a crucial role in navigation.\n\nA series of yellow and black traffic cones have been placed on the right side of the road, creating a demarcated pattern. The ego car is advised to keep to the left to avoid this demarcated area, which might be unsafe or indicative of ongoing roadwork.\n\nFurthermore, a long green barrier is present alongside the right of the road. This barrier likely marks a construction zone, suggesting that the ego car should maintain a safe distance to avoid any potential construction-related hazards.\n\nIt is important to note that there are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, or other objects present in this traffic image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
