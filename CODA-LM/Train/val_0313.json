The presence of the bus may obscure the view of the ego vehicle and impede the sighting of any other hazards or road users that could emerge unexpectedly from in front of or behind the stationary vehicle.\n\nOn the road, there is a pedestrian spotted crossing the street ahead at a distance on the right side of the ego vehicle, potentially prompting the vehicle to slow down or halt to allow the individual to cross safely. Additionally, a motorcyclist is observed driving towards the ego vehicle on the opposite side of the road, necessitating cautious observation and readiness for any unforeseen movements the motorcyclist might perform.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there are directional signs and a 'No Parking' sign on the right side of the road, which offer navigational assistance and parking regulations but generally do not have an immediate impact on the driving behavior. More critically, a regulatory 'No vehicles in both directions' sign is also present to the right, signaling that the roadway ahead is essentially closed in that particular area or lane, which may enforce a reroute.\n\nFor traffic control measures, several traffic cones have been strategically placed in the right lane leading up to the traffic regulation sign, reinforcing that the right lane is not available for use, likely due to roadworks or some form of blockage. \n\nNo traffic lights, barriers, or other significant objects are reported in this traffic image that could potentially affect driving conditions for the ego vehicle."
