It is typically used to prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway and to shield them from hazards.

If the traffic in the opposing lane is clear and it is legal and safe to do so, the ego car may consider changing lanes to pass the truck. However, the driver should be cautious and observe any possible signs prohibiting such maneuvers. If a lane change is not safe or legal, the vehicle should wait until the truck moves or other instructions are given by road authorities or traffic officers."
