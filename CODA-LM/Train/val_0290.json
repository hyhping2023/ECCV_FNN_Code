These vehicles reduce the drivable width and may obscure pedestrians or suddenly opening doors, requiring a more cautious driving approach.\n   - Further ahead, vehicles in motion, including one crossing the intersection and another following, are observed. This situation may impact the traffic flow and necessitates that the ego car adjust speed or be prepared to stop, especially if these vehicles indicate intentions to turn or decelerate.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - A traffic light displaying a red signal is visible in the distance. This mandates that the ego car prepare to halt at the upcoming intersection, adhering to traffic regulations.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Three traffic cones situated towards the right side of the road slightly narrow the driving lane. They signify a possible hazard or ongoing roadwork, advising the ego car to subtly merge left while maintaining proper lane discipline to navigate safely past the cones.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, barriers, or other objects are present in this traffic image, indicating a lesser complexity in those aspects for the moment."

In the context of driving, the presence of this cone would indicate that the driver should stay clear of the area it marks, which might be due to road work, an obstacle, or a hazard on the road.",

Merging slightly to the left to avoid the traffic cones while ensuring it does not cross into the opposite lane is advisable."
