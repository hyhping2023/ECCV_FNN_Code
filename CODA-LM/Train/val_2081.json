In the driving scenario, this vehicle affects the ego car's behavior by potentially slowing down traffic and requiring increased caution. The mixer's size and the operation activity around it might also impose spatial constraints, prompting the ego car to keep a safe distance and be prepared for sudden stops or debris on the road.",
