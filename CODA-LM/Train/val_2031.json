It is designed to haul heavy construction equipment, likely from one site to another. The presence of this vehicle on the road impacts the ego car by potentially slowing down traffic flow, especially if the vehicle is entering or exiting construction sites. Drivers need to be cautious and may need to adjust their speed or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance from this vehicle.",

This vehicle has features typical of such equipment, including a cabin for the operator and a large articulated arm, which is used for digging, lifting, or moving materials. Its presence in the traffic scene suggests ongoing construction work nearby, which could result in restricted lane access, potential detours, or reduced speed limits for the ego car. Thus, the ego cars driver must remain vigilant, potentially adjust speed, and be ready to obey any temporary traffic signs or signals that might be installed to manage traffic around the construction zone.",

The driver should be prepared to change lanes to the left, if safe, to avoid the construction vehicle with the crane arm. Maintain a cautious speed to allow for safe maneuvering around the construction area, adhering to any temporary traffic directions or personnel on-site, and staying vigilant for any sudden movements from construction vehicles or workers that may enter the roadway."
