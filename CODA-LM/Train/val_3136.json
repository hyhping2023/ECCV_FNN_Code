This vehicle influences the speed and following distance that the ego car must maintain. There are also construction workers on the right side, near the roadwork area. Their presence near the roadway could lead to potential movement into the ego car's path, requiring safety precautions and close attention. Meanwhile, there are bright orange traffic cones lining the right side of the road, which indicate roadwork ahead and signal a potential hazard. This necessitates reduced speed and increased awareness by the ego car to safely navigate the area. Additionally, red and white plastic barriers are placed along the edge of the right lane where the roadwork is occurring. These barriers suggest that the right lane is partially or fully closed ahead, which may require the ego car to change lanes to the left if the right lane is obstructed. There are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported, suggesting these elements are not relevant or present in this specific scene."
