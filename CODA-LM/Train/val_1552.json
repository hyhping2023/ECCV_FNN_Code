This vehicle is in a nearby lane and, while it isn't presenting an immediate danger, it should be kept under observation for possible unexpected lane changes.\n\nThe presence of vulnerable road users is quite pronounced. Two pedestrians are crossing the street directly in front of the ego vehicle, with one of them holding a dog by a leash, necessitating that they be granted the right of way. There is an additional pedestrian on the right, who is in the process of crossing over to the left side, and must equally be given the right of way by the ego car. Furthermore, there is a cyclist in the distance towards the left, moving across the intersection. The cyclist's movement pattern warrants close attention since there is a potential risk of them entering the ego car's trajectory.\n\nIn this particular scene, there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that need to be accounted for by the ego car."
