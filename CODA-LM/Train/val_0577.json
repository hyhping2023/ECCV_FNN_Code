This situation requires the ego car to be cautious and consider a lane change if necessary. Additionally, there are several vehicles ahead in the distance occupying both lanes, signaling to the ego car to be attentive to traffic flow, speed, and lane selection.\n\nThough there are no vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists immediately visible, this calls for the ego car to maintain normal driving behavior while remaining vigilant for any potential encounters.\n\nA prominent crosswalk sign on the right alerts the ego car to the likelihood of pedestrians crossing, suggesting the need to prepare to yield accordingly. Conversely, the lack of traffic lights in the vision range for the ego car's direction means that the ego car should guide its driving decisions based on other road signs, markings, and user behaviors.\n\nIn the vicinity of the bus, traffic cones are present, warning of work or obstacles, leading to the possibility that the ego car might have to merge leftward to avoid any hazards. Metal barriers are also in place on the right side of the road, emphasizing the boundary between the road and the sidewalk, and serving as a reminder for the ego car not to deviate toward the pedestrian area.\n\nLastly, there is a trash bin next to the sidewalk near the crosswalk sign, which does not directly impact traffic flow but still requires the ego car to stay aware of any stationary objects that might present unforeseen dangers."
