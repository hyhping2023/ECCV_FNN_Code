        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a large yellow vehicle, possibly a mobile crane, directly in front of the ego car. It occupies the rightmost lane and partially the central lane, affecting the traffic flow and necessitating careful maneuvering due to its size and proximity. Additionally, a truck is positioned on the left side of the ego car, with its large rearview mirrors and the top of its cargo area visible. The truck's close proximity to the crane creates a narrow space for the ego car, complicating any potential lane changes.\n\nOn the sidewalk to the right, there are multiple pedestrians parallel to the direction of the ego car. While they are not on the road, their presence requires attention in case any pedestrian unexpectedly steps onto the roadway.\n\nOver the center of the intersection ahead, a traffic light displaying a green light can be seen. The green light signals that the ego car's direction has the right of way, but due to the crane's slow movement, there may be a need to be prepared to stop.\n\nLastly, there are patches of snow beside the road, remnants of recent snow clearance. These snow piles could reduce the available road width and pose potential hazards if parts of the road remain covered or become slippery."

Continue to monitor the traffic light for changes and adjust speed to maintain safety in wet conditions."
