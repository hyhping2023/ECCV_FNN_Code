Additionally, several vehicles with brake lights visible are ahead in the left lane, indicating that these vehicles may be slowing down or stopping due to traffic conditions, so the ego car should prepare to reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nThe traffic signs include arrow signs on barrier boards that direct traffic from the right to the left lane, instructing the ego car to merge left due to the closure of the right lane ahead.\n\nA red traffic light is observed at the intersection ahead, indicating that the ego car must stop at the intersection until the light turns green.\n\nThere are numerous traffic cones placed in a line, which demarcate the closed right lane starting from the emergency vehicle and leading towards the intersection. These cones suggest the lane closure and that the ego car should remain in the left lane.\n\nBarriers are present on the right side of the road, indicating a work zone or incident area, highlighting the need to keep the vehicle within the designated traffic lane.\n\nLastly, there is a large cylindrical object near the barrier on the right side, which could be roadwork material storage. This object further indicates ongoing roadwork or maintenance activities and necessitates additional caution."
