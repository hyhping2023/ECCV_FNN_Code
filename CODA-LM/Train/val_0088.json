This suggests that the SUV is slowing or preparing to stop, necessitating the ego car to adjust its following distance and speed accordingly.\n\nAlso present is a white hatchback parked on the left side of the road, opposing the traffic direction. While the parked hatchback doesn't pose an immediate risk, it flags a potential hazard area for pedestrians who might emerge from behind the vehicle, thus necessitating extra vigilance from the ego car.\n\nThere is a pedestrian observed on the right sidewalk, who is moving in a direction parallel to the roadway. Although not crossing, monitoring is required in case the pedestrian decides to cross at an unexpected point.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is noted to be using the bike lane positioned to the right of the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist warrants careful driving as they could potentially swerve out of the bike lane or be forced into the driving lane due to obstructions.\n\nAbove the roadway at the intersection, directional signs are present, which assist in lane navigation for the ego car, dependent on the destination in mind.\n\nThe ego car is also approaching a traffic light which is currently red for the lane it is in. This signals the ego car to ready itself to halt if it isn't already doing so because of the SUV's braking action in front.\n\nA formation of traffic cones line up on the ego car's right, establishing a partition between the driving lane and the cyclist's path. These cones serve as a visual guide ensuring that the ego car does not intrude into the space allocated for cyclists.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects present that are mentioned in the data, thus no further actions are required regarding them."
