On the right side, there's a military truck that is green in color and is carrying cargo. It appears to be inactive; however, caution is advised when passing by to account for any movement or if the cargo is unstable. Directly behind the military truck, there's a civilian truck, which is only partly visible and has a blue tarp covering its cargo. This truck is also stationary, but given its close proximity to the road, there is a risk that it might enter traffic unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pedestrian wearing a red top walking along the road on the left side. Special attention should be paid to this person as they are close to the road, which raises the possibility of an unforeseen crossing.\n\nOn the same left side of the road, a line of orange traffic cones is placed, suggesting the presence of construction work or roadway damage. As a result, a driver would need to adjust their driving path to steer clear of these cones.\n\nConcrete traffic barriers are present on the right side of the road and are equipped with reflective stripes. These serve as a warning to not enter the closed-off area, and thus the ego car must navigate around these barriers.\n\nLastly, there is a red dustbin located near the road's edge on the left, near the pedestrian. This stationary object should be kept in mind due to its closeness to the potential driving path.\n\nThere are no traffic signs or traffic lights depicted in the image, so these categories are not a concern in the current context."
