Tricycles are typically slower than standard motor vehicles and require additional caution from drivers.

In this scenario, the tricycle is on the road ahead of the ego car and appears to be partially loaded, possibly with goods. The presence of the tricycle on the road influences the driving behavior of the ego car as it may reduce the available driving space and require the driver to slow down or change lanes to safely overtake. The tricycle's slower speed and bulk will necessitate cautious driving, especially in an urban or semi-urban road environment where space may be more constrained.",

Keeping a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead and being observant for any activity around the parked vehicles is also advised. No immediate lane changes appear necessary, but the driver should be ready to adapt to the actions of the green three-wheeled vehicle and other road users. Checking rear and side mirrors before any maneuvers is essential to ensure safety."
