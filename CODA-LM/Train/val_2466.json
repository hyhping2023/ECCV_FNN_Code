        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are no vehicles or vulnerable road users present. However, it does feature a traffic sign, specifically a directional arrow sign mounted on the barrier indicating a left turn ahead. This sign is crucial as it informs the ego car that the road is curving to the left, emphasizing the necessity to adjust the driving path accordingly to maintain safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are orange traffic cones positioned on the side of the road near the barrier. These cones are important because they likely mark an area of potential hazard or road work, signaling the ego car to stay clear and ensure it remains in the appropriate lane for safe passage.\n\nMetal barriers with reflective panels are also present on both sides of the road. The significance of these barriers is that they clearly define the driving path and restrict the ego car to the existing roadway, preventing any off-road maneuvers and enhancing safety by providing visible delineation, especially under low light conditions.\n\nNo traffic lights, other objects, or further details about traffic control devices are observed in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a traffic cone, typically used in roadways to mark areas where traffic may need to be modified or redirected, often due to construction or temporary changes in traffic patterns. This specific cone can influence future driving behaviors by signaling to the driver to stay clear of a designated area, potentially indicating the presence of road work, obstacles, or hazards ahead. Recognizing this object is crucial for maintaining safe driving conditions and adhering to modified traffic routes.",
