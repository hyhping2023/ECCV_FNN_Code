This vehicle is positioned on the right side of the road and is partially encroaching on the lane of the ego car. This positioning poses a potential hazard as it could reduce the available road space for the ego car and might cause unexpected obstructions.

It is loaded onto the back of a flatbed truck, indicating that it is possibly being transported to or from a construction site. When driving near such vehicles, precaution is required as their size and the load they carry can affect their maneuverability and stopping distance.",

This particular tricycle appears to be motorized, which is typical for such vehicles to facilitate easier movement alongside regular motor traffic. When driving near tricycles, especially in foggy conditions as seen in the image, it is essential to maintain a safe following distance and be vigilant as these vehicles are smaller and less visible than standard cars.",

Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to maneuver to the left if necessary to safely pass the encroaching construction vehicle while being mindful of any oncoming traffic that might be obscured by the fog. Use of headlights and possibly fog lights is also recommended to improve visibility."
