        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, several road users and conditions are noted which have implications for autonomous driving behavior. Firstly, there is a white sedan coming towards the ego car in the opposite lane, which is slightly veering towards the center. This oncoming vehicle poses a potential hazard as it is not fully within its own lane, necessitating increased attention from the autonomous driving system to maintain safety. \n\nAdditionally, various vehicles are parked on the right side of the road ahead. These parked vehicles reduce the available driving space on the road, requiring the autonomous system to ensure that the adjacent lane is clear of moving traffic before it can adjust the vehicle's position or safely proceed past the parked cars. \n\nMoreover, a black vehicle is observed in the same lane as the ego car, moving in the same direction but located a distance ahead. This situation requires the autonomous system to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle. It must also stay prepared for any sudden braking or turning maneuvers the black vehicle might undertake, adjusting the ego vehicle's speed and positioning as necessary to prevent any potential collisions. \n\nLastly, a significant challenge for both autonomous systems and human drivers is presented by the glaring sunlight low on the horizon. This glare could notably impair visibility, making it crucial for the autonomous driving system to adjust its sensors to better cope with the lowered visibility conditions. In circumstances where a human is part of the driving equation, the use of sun visors and heightened caution is advised to mitigate the glare's impact.\n\nThese observations collectively highlight the multifaceted challenges autonomous driving systems must navigate, from dynamically responding to on-road behaviors of other vehicles to adapting to environmental conditions such as sunlight glare. Each element demands specific adjustments to the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle to ensure ongoing safety and efficiency on the road."

Dustbins are typically used for disposing of garbage to help maintain cleanliness in public areas. Its location close to the roadside can influence driving behavior by necessitating alertness and caution from the driver of the ego car.
