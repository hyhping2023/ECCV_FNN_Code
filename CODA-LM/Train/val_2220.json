This situation suggests that the pedestrian may enter the crosswalk, which could impact the driving decisions of the ego car, such as yielding or stopping to allow the pedestrian to cross safely.\n\nAdditionally, a single yellow traffic cone is positioned on the road to the right side of the ego car's lane. The presence of the traffic cone signals a potential hazard or an alteration in the normal traffic pattern, and the ego car may need to alter its course of travel to avoid this obstacle.\n\nMoreover, the road is lined with a series of white and grey bollards on both sides, delineating the separation between the sidewalk and the carriageway. These barriers are critical in defining the boundaries of pedestrian and vehicle zones, assisting the ego car in maintaining its lane and preventing inadvertent movement onto the sidewalk.\n\nNo other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, or miscellaneous objects are reported in the scene."

A traffic cone is typically used to indicate areas where vehicles are not supposed to pass, acting as a temporary barricade or safety precaution. In this driving scenario, the ego car should be aware of this cone and maintain a safe distance, ensuring that it does not drive too close to the curb or into areas that may be cordoned off for safety or construction. The presence of the cone might also indicate nearby roadwork or an emergency situation.",
