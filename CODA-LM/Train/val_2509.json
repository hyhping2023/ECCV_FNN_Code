The truck seems to be of a heavy-duty type, commonly used in construction or industrial tasks. The visibility of this truck directly ahead indicates to the ego car the need for increased caution due to the large size and potentially unpredictable movements of such heavy machinery. Following this truck at a safe distance is crucial, ensuring sufficient time for reaction if the truck makes sudden stops or turns.",
