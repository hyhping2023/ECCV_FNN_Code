        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene before us, there is a large commercial truck carrying cargo. This truck is notable for being visible from its rear section and is marked by red tail lights. It holds a position in the adjacent lane to the left of the ego vehicle and seems to either be stationary or moving at a slow pace. This sizable vehicle has a significant impact on the driving behavior of the ego car, as its presence and location limit the ego car's ability to maneuver. Additionally, the truck's size is affecting the visibility of the area around the ego car, which the autopilot system in the ego car must account for to ensure safe driving practices. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the image, which suggests that the only consideration for the ego car's driving strategy is the presence and behavior of the large truck in its vicinity."

The presence of such a vehicle indicates ongoing or imminent construction work nearby, which may affect traffic patterns. Drivers, including the ego car, should be cautious and prepared for potential delays or temporary traffic changes. It is also advisable to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle to avoid debris or spillage which can occur from the mixing drum.",

Keep an eye out for any signals from the truck indicating a turn or merge that could affect the ego car's trajectory. Also, monitor the mirrors and blind spots for other vehicles that may be obscured by the truck's large size."
