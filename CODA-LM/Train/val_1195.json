It is a sedan located ahead in the same lane as the ego car, with its taillights illuminated, which suggests that it is either moving or prepared to move. The sedan's position is critical as it directly affects the ego car's ability to navigate safely and requires maintaining an appropriate distance behind it to ensure safety.

In low-light conditions as shown, spotting cyclists can be challenging, necessitating that the ego car should reduce speed and increase vigilance to avoid potential collisions and ensure the safety of all road users.",
