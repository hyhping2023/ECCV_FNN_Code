A variety of vehicles, including a black sedan closest to the ego car, are parked on the right side of the road. This arrangement narrows the navigable roadway and could obstruct the view of pedestrians or other road users attempting to cross or walk along the roadway. Additionally, on the left side of the ego car, before the start of the built-up area, there are stacks of packaged boxes. These boxes could limit visibility and pose an unexpected obstruction if workers are around moving them or if they were to fall onto the road."

The boxes are stacked in a way that suggests they are being prepared for shipment or have just been delivered. These boxes are placed very close to the roadway and could pose potential risks to the ego vehicle.

The presence of this sedan necessitates heightened awareness from the driver of the ego car, who must potentially adjust their driving path to safely navigate past the parked car, possibly requiring a slight steering adjustment to the left depending on the available space.",

Keep a lookout for any potential obstacles or road users that may emerge from between the parked vehicles. Maintain a slow speed to allow for safe reaction time, in case of unexpected events. Additionally, since there are no visible lane markings, the ego car should be prepared for oncoming traffic and should stay as far right as possible within the navigable area of the street."
