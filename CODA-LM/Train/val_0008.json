This sedan's position and speed necessitate that the ego car maintains a safe following distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign on the right side of the road, though it is not clearly visible in the image. Due to its illegibility, the ego car should proceed with caution and adhere to general speed limits or rules typical for this type of road.\n\nYellow and red traffic cones are placed on the left edge of the road, marking the boundary of the driving lane. These cones suggest potential road work or hazards on the left side, narrowing the drivable path and requiring the ego car to stay within the designated lane.\n\nThere are also blue and white barriers on the right, which separate the road from a pedestrian and bicycle lane. These barriers guide the flow of traffic and ensure that vehicles, including the ego car, do not accidentally enter the bicycle lane."
