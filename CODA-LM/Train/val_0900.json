This truck takes up most of the width of the lane, limiting the space available for other vehicles to navigate through. Due to its considerable size, it may contribute to slower moving traffic and reduced visibility for the drivers following it, as it obstructs the view of the road ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a continuous concrete barrier on the right side of the road. This permanent structure serves to prevent all vehicles from entering or exiting the adjacent land at that particular stretch. The barrier also implies that overtaking or passing any slower vehicle on the right-hand side is not feasible, thereby impacting the flow and maneuverability of traffic."

This vehicle may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by causing the driver to slow down or change lanes to maintain safety due to potentially slower movement of the construction vehicle or unexpected maneuvers. Additionally, the construction vehicle's presence might suggest nearby construction activity, prompting the ego car's driver to be more vigilant and prepared for altered road conditions or temporary traffic signs.",
