However, there is a directional sign on the right side indicating that the ego car is required to turn left at the intersection ahead, as denoted by the red arrow on the sign. Traffic cones are also present, arranged in an orange and white line starting from the center of the road and curving towards the left, hinting at a temporary traffic pattern or a road area that may be under construction or otherwise unsafe, which will necessitate the ego car to move towards the left to avoid it. Additionally, there is a small, temporary structure on the right side of the road, resemblant of a guard booth or a road work shed. This structure indicates that there might be roadside activity which should be cautiously monitored for emerging personnel or equipment that could affect traffic conditions. There are no traffic lights or barriers within the observed scene."
