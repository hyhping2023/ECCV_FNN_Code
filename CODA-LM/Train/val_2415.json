The position of this vehicle suggests that it might be stationary, but there is a possibility that the driver could open the door or pull out into traffic unexpectedly. As a result, the ego vehicle should maintain caution while passing by.\n\nAdditionally, several pedestrians are observed walking along the side of the road and crossing the street. Given that pedestrians can behave unpredictably, it is important for the ego vehicle to reduce speed and be ready to stop if it becomes necessary to ensure their safety.\n\nLastly, there is a cart-like structure located on the edge of the roadway, which appears to be stationary. This object could potentially narrow the drivable lane width and poses a hazard if it were to be moved unexpectedly. The ego vehicle should be aware of this object and monitor it for any changes in position that could affect the driving path."
