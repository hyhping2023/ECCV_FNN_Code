This truck's proximity and size could obstruct the ego vehicle's view of the road ahead, and a sudden brake by the truck could increase the risk of a rear-end collision; hence, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial. Additionally, there is a dark-colored sedan on the left side of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead. The sedanâ€™s presence could indicate a potential lane change or merge, requiring the ego vehicle to be cautious and monitor the sedan's movements.\n\nTo the right of the ego vehicle, pedestrians are observed on the sidewalk. The proximity of the pedestrians to the roadway means they could potentially enter the street, necessitating the ego vehicle to be ready to stop or slow down.\n\nThere is also a blue traffic sign with a white arrow pointing up, located on the right side of the ego vehicle. This sign likely indicates a designated lane or the direction that traffic must follow, prompting the ego vehicle to stay in the correct lane accordingly."
