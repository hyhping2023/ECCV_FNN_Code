These vehicles have their rear lights illuminated, signaling that they are stationary. The significance of these parked cars is that they decrease the available width of the road for driving, which necessitates careful maneuvering by drivers to bypass them safely without causing any collisions.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a noticeable yellow signboard positioned close to the roadside near the ego vehicle. This signboard could be displaying local notifications, warnings, or advertisements. It's crucial for drivers to acknowledge this signboard as it might contain essential information. However, it's equally important to ensure that it does not divert the driver's focus excessively from the road conditions and traffic around them."
