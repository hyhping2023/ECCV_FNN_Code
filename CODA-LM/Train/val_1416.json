This parked van could potentially limit visibility for the ego car and other road users, highlighting the importance of cautious driving in this area to accommodate for reduced visibility and space.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users:** Noticed on the same side of the road are a pair of pedestrians, one adorned in a yellow top and the other in blue, walking toward the ego car. Their proximity to the driving path poses a potential risk for accidents, especially if they were to unexpectedly step onto the road. This necessitates a heightened awareness from the driver of the ego car to prepare for unexpected pedestrian movements.\n\n3. **Barriers:** Along the right side of the road, there is temporary construction fencing, indicating ongoing construction work or a closed-off area. This barrier effectively reduces the available road width, prompting the need for cautious driving to avoid any obstacles that may extend into the roadway from the fenced area.\n\nThe traffic scene is currently devoid of active traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects that might further impact driving behavior or road conditions. This summary captures the immediate considerations for safe and attentive driving in response to the described road conditions and users."
