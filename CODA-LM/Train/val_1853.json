It is described as a blue circular sign featuring a white bus symbol and a directional arrow, located on the right side. This sign serves as an important indication for the ego vehicle to understand that the rightmost lane is reserved for buses, which may affect its lane selection by signaling a limitation for non-bus vehicles in that particular lane.\n\nAdditionally, the traffic light situation is described. There is a green traffic light in view, straight ahead, signaling that the ego vehicle can continue through the intersection. The explanation signifies that the vehicle should maintain its current speed and follow the traffic light's directions, provided that the light stays green and the intersection remains unobstructed. No other categories including vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are reported, indicating their absence from the scene."
