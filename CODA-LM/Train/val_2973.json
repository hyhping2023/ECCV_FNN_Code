It appears to be either stopped or moving slowly, which may obstruct part of the lane. The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the bus and be ready to change lanes or decelerate if required.\n  - A concrete mixer truck is situated in the middle of the image, with its chute raised. This large, slow-moving vehicle could obstruct traffic. The ego car should exercise caution, reduce speed, and be ready to change lanes to avoid potential collisions or delays.\n  - A white vehicle is partially visible behind the concrete mixer truck, suggesting potential traffic congestion or a queue forming. The ego car should be vigilant and anticipate possible sudden stops or lane changes from the vehicles ahead.\n\nNo other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in the image."
