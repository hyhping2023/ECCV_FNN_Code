It is large and slow-moving, which will affect the ego car's speed and may necessitate a lane change to overtake the cement mixer safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a truck in the right lane, which has a covered cargo area. The presence of this truck means that the ego car must be cautious when considering a lane change to the right, as the truck is occupying that space.\n\nOn the far left lane, there is a bus that appears to be in motion, driving parallel to the ego car. This bus introduces a dynamic element to the traffic environment, which the ego car needs to monitor, particularly if a lane change to the left is being contemplated.\n\nAhead of the truck, in the right lane, there is a partially visible white car. The ego car needs to maintain awareness of this vehicle, as it could affect decisions regarding lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\nLastly, there is a traffic light visible above the cement mixer, which is showing green. This indicates that the ego car and other vehicles have the right of way to proceed.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
