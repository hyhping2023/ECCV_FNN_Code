These parked vehicles reduce the drivable road space, and the oncoming vehicle's headlights may momentarily impair visibility. Pedestrians are observed walking in the same direction as the ego vehicle ahead on the road, partially occupying the lane. This poses a potential safety risk as their movements could be unpredictable and, hence, hazardous. On the right side of the road, there is a 'No Entry' sign, accompanied by a circular speed limit sign indicating a 5 mph zone, suggesting that the ego vehicle must be prepared to stop or proceed at very low speeds. Additionally, an array of bags and debris near the parked cars and 'No Entry' sign could pose a risk if they were to enter the roadway and make the road boundary unclear. Traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in this scene."
