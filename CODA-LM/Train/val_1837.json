Also included in the row of construction vehicles are wheel loaders and excavators. Oppositely, several cars are parked on the roadside, which may narrow the passable road and increase the risk of unexpected pedestrian movement or doors opening onto the street.\n\nAdditionally, a white van is captured traveling in the opposite direction, which highlights the presence of oncoming traffic and the need for the ego car to stay in its lane carefully. In the distance, traffic lights are visible and showing green, informing the ego car it can continue on its path if conditions are safe and clear. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects detected in this image that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
