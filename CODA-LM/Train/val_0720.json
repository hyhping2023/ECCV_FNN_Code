Directly in front of the ego vehicle is a white truck with visible brake lights, suggesting it is either slowing down or has stopped. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance from this truck to ensure sufficient stopping time and to react to any sudden movements. Additionally, on the right side of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead in the next lane over, is an orange truck equipped with a crane arm, likely a utility or construction vehicle. The ego car should closely monitor this truck for any lateral movements or merging that could affect its lane.\n\nMoreover, traffic cones are positioned along the right side of the road, indicating a work zone or road obstruction ahead. This setup implies a potential hazard or lane narrowing, signaling that the ego car should proceed with caution, potentially reduce speed, and be prepared for changes in traffic patterns."

The driver should watch for any further road signage or traffic guidance that may become visible as they approach the area with the traffic cones."
