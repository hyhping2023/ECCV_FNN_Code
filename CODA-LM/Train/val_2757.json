It is partially obstructing the lane, posing a risk that the vehicle may move into the lane and require the autonomous car to either adjust its path or come to a stop to avoid a collision.\n\nAhead of the car, a cyclist is traveling in the same direction, occupying the middle of the lane. This situation necessitates that the autonomous car slow down and possibly execute a lane change to safely overtake the cyclist.\n\nAdditionally, there are pedestrians adjacent to the parked vehicle on the left side. The proximity of the pedestrians to the roadway presents a potential hazard, as they might step onto the road. Hence, the autonomous car must remain alert and prepared to stop or slow down if necessary to ensure the safety of the pedestrians.\n\nOn the roadside, a traffic sign is present with a blue and yellow design indicating construction work. This sign serves as a warning for possible obstructions or workers ahead, advising the autonomous car to proceed with increased caution.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that would impact the driving behavior of the autonomous car."
