        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are two vehicles of interest. The first is a large green commercial vehicle equipped with mounted apparatus on its bed, which is situated ahead to the right of the ego car and moving in the same direction. It presents a potential hazard as it could obstruct visibility or make unpredictable maneuvers due to its size and cargo. Second is a small red car positioned farther ahead, also traveling along the same trajectory as the ego car. This vehicle seems to be moving normally, but it requires attention as it may stop abruptly or alter its speed unexpectedly.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in the traffic image that would impact the driving decisions of the autonomous vehicle."

The presence of this construction vehicle on the road impacts the driving behavior as it may suggest ongoing or impending road work ahead. Drivers, including the ego car, should be prepared for potential disruptions such as lane narrowing, diversions, or reduced speed limits. Caution and attentiveness are required when approaching and passing this type of vehicle to ensure safety and compliance with any temporary traffic signs or rules that might be in effect because of the construction work.",
