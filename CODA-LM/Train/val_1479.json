Traffic is actively moving around this vehicle. The presence of the service vehicle suggests that it may be dealing with an incident or performing maintenance. Consequently, this necessitates vigilance from the ego vehicle and may require an adjustment to its driving path to safely navigate around the service vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, there is a yield or give way sign located beyond the service vehicle on the right-hand side of the road. The sign is only partially visible. It serves as a warning that the ego vehicle may need to slow down or stop to yield right of way to other road users in the area.\n\nComplementing these indications, multiple traffic cones are set in a line on the right side of the road. The cones start from the foreground and continue into the midground, clearly outlining the periphery of an incident or construction zone. Their configuration suggests the presence of a potential hazard or change in the customary traffic flow, pointing to the need for the ego vehicle to steer clear of the coned zone.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signals, barriers, or other objects noted in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle, as those categories are not present in this reported scene."
