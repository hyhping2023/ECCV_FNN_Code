On the right, there is a large red container truck occupying the right lane and indicating a potential leftward lane change or merge, which the ego car must monitor closely to adjust its speed or change lanes if necessary. Additionally, several cars ahead in the same lane as the ego car have their brake lights on, signaling that the traffic is slowing down or coming to a stop, requiring the ego car to be prepared to slow down or stop. Green traffic lights are visible ahead, making it permissible for vehicles to proceed if the path is clear; however, the ego car must remain vigilant, particularly with the potential lane change of the large truck. Furthermore, bright orange traffic cones are positioned on the road, creating a taper that channels traffic away from the rightmost part of the right lane, signifying the presence of road works or obstacles, helping to ensure vehicles move to the left and avoid the coned-off area."
