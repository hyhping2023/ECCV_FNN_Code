These vehicles are positioned in front of the ego car and are moving in the same direction. The presence and movement of these vehicles are critical for the ego car's speed control and lane choice, as it is important to maintain safe following distances.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign that is dimly lit and partially hidden by infrastructure on the left side of the road. This sign indicates a road curvature or a potential detour ahead. The ego car may need to reduce speed and be prepared for an upcoming change in the road layout due to this sign.\n\nA traffic light displaying a red signal is also visible ahead in the lane the ego car is traveling in. This red light necessitates that the ego car must come to a complete stop in compliance with the traffic signals.\n\nFurthermore, barriers and construction signs are present on the right side of the road, signaling a construction zone ahead. The ego car will need to reduce speed and exercise increased caution due to the construction, as lanes might be merging or shifting, and there could be workers or machinery in close proximity to the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects reported in the image."
