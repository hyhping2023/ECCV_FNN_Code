The truck's rear wheels, lower chassis, and container are visible, implying proximity to the ego vehicle. Since only a portion of the truck is shown, it suggests the ego car may be overtaking or following closely.",

        "description and explanation": "The image includes a large grey truck in motion, occupying the lane to the right of the ego car. The truck is partially visible with its rear wheels, lower chassis, and container in view, which indicates that it is in close proximity to the ego vehicle. This truncated view of the truck may suggest that the ego car is either overtaking or closely following the truck. Given the truck's size and nearness, there is a potential hazard as its position limits the ego car's ability to safely change lanes or perform other maneuvers. Maintaining a safe distance and thoroughly monitoring the truck's actions is essential for the ego vehicle's driving behavior. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large, gray, industrial truck's cargo container. It appears to be made of metal and rectangular in shape, indicative of containers used for transporting goods or raw materials. The presence of such a large vehicle beside the ego vehicle affects driving behavior by necessitating greater caution, especially in terms of maintaining a safe distance and being aware of the truck's potential blind spots. Such large vehicles often have restricted maneuverability and longer stopping distances, thus requiring other vehicles, including the ego vehicle, to adjust their speed and lane position accordingly.",

The ego vehicle should remain alert for any additional road users that may not be visible in this image, especially considering the truck might obstruct the view of smaller vehicles or vulnerable road users ahead."
