This truck could pose a potential hazard as it might make sudden movements, such as unexpectedly changing lanes. Directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane, is a large yellow construction vehicle. The proximity of this vehicle is a factor the ego car must consider to maintain a safe following distance. Due to the slower pace of the construction vehicle, it might also affect the driving speed of the ego car.\n\nAs for traffic lights, there are three green lights visible, granting the ego car the right to proceed. This allows the ego car to continue at its current speed without the need to prepare to stop.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could impact the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

It has a large bucket at the front, which is commonly used for moving or carrying large amounts of building materials or earth. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates that there may be ongoing road work or construction nearby. Drivers should be cautious, reduce their speed, and be prepared for potential obstacles or irregularities on the road ahead. This can influence the driving behavior by necessitating a heightened sense of alertness and possibly leading to changes in usual traffic patterns.",
