This large vehicle may move slowly and have limited visibility, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain additional following distance.\n  - A white car is in the lane to the right of the ego vehicle, slightly ahead. The presence of this car requires awareness as it might change lanes or adjust its speed suddenly.\n  - A motorcyclist is in the right lane, beside the white car. Motorcyclists are more vulnerable and less visible, necessitating careful monitoring in case of sudden lane changes or stops.\n\n- **Traffic Signs**:\n  - A \"No entry\" sign for pedestrians is visible on the sidewalk to the right. This indicates that pedestrians are not allowed to enter the road at this point, reducing the likelihood of pedestrian-related incidents in that area.\n\n- **Barriers**:\n  - There is a metal barrier between the roadway and the sidewalk running along the right side. These barriers separate traffic from the pedestrian zone, indicating that vehicles should not expect pedestrians to enter the roadway here.\n\n- **Other Objects**:\n  - A series of white and blue striped traffic signs is visible on the right.
