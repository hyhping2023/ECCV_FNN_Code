Firstly, there are two vehicles in the scene. An excavator is stationed on the right side, partially obstructing the lane with a pile of dirt in front, which could impede traffic flow and require the ego vehicle to either slow down or change lanes. Additionally, there is a white car moving ahead in the left lane in the same direction as the ego vehicle, playing a crucial role in determining the follow distance and lane changing decisions for the ego vehicle.\n\nFor traffic signs, there is a green light visible, indicating that traffic can proceed without stopping, thus informing the ego vehicleâ€™s decision to continue moving forward.\n\nThe only other objects mentioned are piles of construction materials, specifically dirt, located on the right side of the road beyond the construction vehicle. These materials limit the road width and create a potential hazard, necessitating cautious navigation by the ego vehicle.\n\nThe image does not contain any vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or additional traffic lights as these categories were omitted from the description."
