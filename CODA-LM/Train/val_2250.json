They are facing the opposite direction of travel. Their stationary position suggests they are not an immediate hazard. However, their presence indicates that there could be activity nearby, which might have an impact on the road conditions.\n\nTraffic Signs: A speed limit sign is present, which displays the number '30', signifying a speed limit of 30 km/h. This sign is attached to the traffic light pole on the right side, positioned ahead of the ego car. It is important that the ego car adheres to this posted speed limit to comply with traffic rules and maintain safety on the road.\n\nTraffic Lights: The traffic light located in the centerpiece of the image shows a red light facing the ego car's direction of travel, in combination with a green arrow that grants permission for a right turn. The implication for the ego car is to come to a stop due to the red light but proceed to make a right turn if that is the chosen route, following the green arrow's permission.\n\nTraffic Cones: There are numerous orange and white traffic cones arranged on the left side of the intersection. The placement of these cones typically indicates either ongoing road work or the closure of part of the road for safety reasons. It is advised that the driver remains alert, exercises caution, and may need to consider changing lanes if required.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, barriers, or other objects reported in the image. Therefore, these categories are not considered in the situational summary."
