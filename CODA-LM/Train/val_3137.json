The presence of the oncoming van requires the ego car to stay on the correct side of the road to avoid a head-on collision. Additionally, there is a blue truck ahead in the same lane as the ego car, moving in the same direction. The ego car should monitor the speed of the truck and maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a worker wearing a high-visibility jacket near the line of traffic cones. The worker's proximity to the roadway means the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop if the worker moves into the road.\n\nFurthermore, there is a line of multi-colored traffic cones placed along the right side of the road leading into the distance. These cones might indicate roadwork or a section of the road that is out of bounds for vehicles, which would necessitate the ego car to steer clear of them.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
