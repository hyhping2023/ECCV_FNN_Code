        "description and explanation": "The traffic image reveals several important elements affecting the ego car's environment. \n\nFirstly, there are two vehicles present. One is a black sedan with an open driver's side door positioned perpendicular to the ego car's line of sight at a fuel pump station. This scenario implies potential movement from the sedan or the driver exiting the vehicle, which might cross the ego carâ€™s path. The second vehicle is a black van parked parallel to the ego car on the left side, with text written on its side. Although the van is stationary, it has the potential to obscure the ego car's visibility, concealing any other road users or vehicles that might emerge from behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there are fuel pumps and associated equipment positioned to the right side of the ego car, indicating that the setting is a gas station. These items are fixed and should not directly affect the ego car's movement, provided a safe distance is maintained. \n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are present in the image."

Ego car must also be aware of the potential for vehicles to exit parking spaces unexpectedly and be prepared to stop or maneuver."
