Designed primarily for transporting large quantities of earth or construction materials, such trucks are characterized by their robust build and hydraulic lifting mechanisms that allow the rear cargo hold to be inclined for unloading material. In driving scenarios, the presence of such a vehicle could influence the behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and possibly altered speed or direction to accommodate the truck's larger turning radius and longer stopping distances.",

If the ego vehicle intends to pass, it should ensure there is enough clear space in the adjacent lane and that it is safe to do so. Use mirrors and cameras to monitor the space around the dump truck. Proceed with caution, especially if the truck shows any sign of activity that might indicate it is about to move or turn."
