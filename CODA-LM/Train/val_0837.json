        "description and explanation": "On the road ahead, there is a large green agricultural vehicle occupying the left lane directly in front of the ego car, distinguished by its visible yellow caution lights. Due to its size and dedicated purpose, this vehicle is likely moving at a slower pace than the rest of the traffic, necessitating that the ego car either adjusts its speed or considers changing lanes to maintain a steady flow.\n\nIn the right lane, slightly ahead of the ego car, there is a red car. Its close proximity to the ego car means it plays a crucial role in how the ego vehicle will decide to change lanes.\n\nOverhead, a traffic light displaying a red signal can be seen, indicating that the traffic ahead, which includes both the green agricultural vehicle and the red car, will be coming to a stop if they have not done so already. Consequently, the ego car should also prepare to bring itself to a halt.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a central barrier that divides the opposing flows of traffic. This barrier is of significance as it restricts any cross-median movement, thus limiting the ego car's possibilities for maneuvers or overtaking."

            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck. It is characterized by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement. These types of vehicles are typically larger and slower moving, which requires other drivers to maintain a safe following distance and possibly prepare for sudden stops or reduced speeds in lanes directly behind or adjacent to the construction vehicle. The presence of such a vehicle suggests ongoing construction work near the road, potentially leading to traffic congestion or disruptions that necessitate alert and cautious driving behavior.",

A lane change may be considered if the left lane is moving significantly slower than the right lane due to the agricultural vehicle, but only if it can be done safely and without conflict with surrounding traffic. As the light is currently red, the ego car should prepare to come to a complete stop while maintaining a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. Additionally, the ego car should keep an eye out for any signs of the red light changing to green and be ready to proceed when it is safe to do so."
