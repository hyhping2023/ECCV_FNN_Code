        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scene, there are two large trucks in view, each occupying one of the two lanes available and positioned directly ahead of the autonomous vehicle. These trucks are identified as cement mixers by their rotating drums, which suggests they are heavy and may have a slower acceleration. As a result of their size and position on the road, these vehicles significantly limit the autonomous vehicle's options for proceeding. There is no available space for the autonomous vehicle to overtake the trucks. Additionally, the trucks' potential slow rate of acceleration necessitates that the autonomous vehicle maintains an increased following distance to ensure safe operation.\n\nAhead, there is also a traffic light that is displaying a green signal. This indicates that the autonomous vehicle has the right of way to continue driving forward. However, despite the green light, due to the large trucks in the path of the autonomous vehicle, caution is advised. The autonomous vehicle should remain vigilant and be prepared to adjust its speed and following distance to adapt to the trucks' slower movement. No other road users, traffic signs, cones, or barriers are observed, and no other objects are affecting the driving conditions for the autonomous vehicle in this scenario."

Its prominent presence on the road requires drivers of nearby vehicles, including the ego car, to exercise increased caution. The size and operational nature of the construction vehicle may lead to slower movements, potential stops for loading or unloading, and the possibility of occupying larger or multiple lanes. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected maneuvers or stops by the construction vehicle.",
