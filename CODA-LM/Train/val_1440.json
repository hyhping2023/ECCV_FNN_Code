These individuals appear to be workers and pose a potential risk as there is a chance they might unexpectedly step onto the road, prompting careful attention from the ego vehicle to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, amongst other objects, a set of large cable reels and a dustbin are positioned on the right side of the roadway. These are not directly on the road but warrant monitoring for situational awareness. The cable reels, in particular, are noteworthy due to their considerable size and their closeness to the edge of the road, which could become hazardous under certain conditions.\n\nThe provided traffic image does not contain any vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers that would affect the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle."

Such items are typically used in construction or utility sectors for electrical installations or telecommunications. For the ego car, encountering large spools by the roadside suggests industrial activity or construction areas nearby. The presence of such materials could indicate potential hazards like nearby operational machinery, temporary obstacles, or workers in the area.
