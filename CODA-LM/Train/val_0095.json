It is crucial to monitor this vehicle's behavior because its sudden stops or speed changes directly impact the ego vehicleâ€™s ability to proceed safely while maintaining proper following distances.\n- A white van is in the right adjacent lane, moving parallel to the ego car. Monitoring this vehicle's movements is important as it could potentially change lanes or affect the traffic flow around the ego car.\n\n**Traffic Signs**:\n- Speed limit signs indicating 60 km/h are posted alongside the road, reinforced by an illuminated '60' speed sign. The ego car must adhere to this speed limit for legal and safety reasons.\n- There are various traffic signs detected overhead: a no-honking sign, a no-left-turn sign, no overtaking sign, and a height limit sign of 4.5m. These restrictions require adjustments in driving behavior such as refraining from honking unless necessary, not making left turns or overtaking, and ensuring the vehicle's clearance height if applicable.\n\n**Traffic Lights**:\n- A green traffic light is overhead, indicating it is legal and safe for the ego car to proceed through the intersection, provided that the way is clear and no signals from the sedan ahead.\n\n**Barriers**:\n- A metal fence barrier is present on the left side of the ego car, separating the road from the sidewalk. The barrier limits the road width and proximity to pedestrians, so the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the barrier."
