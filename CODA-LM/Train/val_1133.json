The side of the truck features control panels and additional support structures for operation. Awareness of such a vehicle in the immediate driving environment is critical as it indicates potential nearby construction activity. Concrete mixer trucks often perform maneuvers like slowing down or stopping to position for concrete pouring, which can affect traffic flow and require additional caution from nearby drivers.",

The vehicle's presence on the road, especially in an active unloading or loading state, necessitates increased caution from the ego car. The ego car must maintain a safe distance and be prepared for potential stops or slow movement from the construction vehicle. This ensures safety due to possibly limited visibility around the truck and avoidance of any sudden changes in the flow of traffic caused by the construction activities.",
