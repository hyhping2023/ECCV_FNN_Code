One is a light-colored sedan positioned in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car. Its brake lights are illuminated, which indicates that it has either slowed down considerably or come to a complete stop. Parallel to the sedan, in the right lane, is a dark-colored SUV. Similar to the sedan, the SUV's brake lights are also on, suggesting it too is slowing down or stationary. \n\nFurthermore, there's a traffic light that plays a crucial role in the current dynamics of the road. It is located above the road to the left of the image and is displaying a red signal. This red light commands the vehicles on the road to halt and remain stationary until it turns green, allowing them to proceed. \n\nIn this scenario, no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present that would impact the driving behavior of the ego car, based on the provided information. This summary encapsulates all the observed road users and their effects on the driving conditions as specified in the provided JSON data."
