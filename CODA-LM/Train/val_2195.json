This truck is large and may obstruct the view of the ego car for any hazards that might be present on the other side of the road. Additionally, its presence indicates construction activity which could affect road conditions.\n\nAhead of the ego car, there is a motorcyclist traveling in the same direction on the road. Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users and may make sudden movements or changes in speed which the ego car should be prepared to react to.\n\nOn the right side of the road, a pedestrian is walking away from the ego car. This pedestrian is in close proximity to the travel path of the ego car, and any unexpected movement towards the road could pose a hazard.\n\nAn orange traffic cone is placed on the left edge of the rightmost lane, indicating a potential hazard or change in the road layout. This suggests that part of the lane might be obstructed or unsafe to drive on, necessitating possible lane changes or reduced driving speed.\n\nThere are green fencing barriers on both sides of the road, which seem to be part of the construction perimeter. These barriers indicate construction work which could mean road workers, machinery movement, or debris might affect the driving conditions."
