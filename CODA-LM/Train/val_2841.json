Due to the possibility of pedestrians entering the street unexpectedly, it is important to remain vigilant and be prepared to stop to give them the right of way.\n\nFurthermore, there is a no parking sign on the right side of the road, indicating that stopping or parking in this area is prohibited. This sign may affect where the ego car can safely pull over if needed.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that impact the driving behavior of the ego car."
