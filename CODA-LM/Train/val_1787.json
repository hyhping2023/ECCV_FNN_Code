The presence of this vehicle is significant as it might enter the lane of our self-driving car (referred to as the ego car) or it could be stopped due to an obstruction that's not visible in the image.\n\nAdditionally, there are two green traffic lights ahead, which indicate that the ego car has the right-of-way to proceed. The green lights are a signal for the ego car to continue along its path, assuming the road ahead is clear of any obstacles.\n\nThe traffic scenario also includes multiple orange traffic cones, positioned on the right side of the ego car's lane. These cones are narrowing the lane and creating a temporary pathway, directing traffic flow. Consequently, the ego car is required to maintain its position to the left of the pathway to avoid the restricted area marked by the cones.\n\nSupporting these cones are yellow and black temporary barriers, which further delineate the restricted area on the right. These barriers work in conjunction with the traffic cones to direct traffic and protect an area that may be hazardous.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, or other objects reported in the JSON data for this particular scene."
