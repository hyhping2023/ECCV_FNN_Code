        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are several road users and traffic elements that the autonomous driving systems need to consider:\n\nRegarding vehicles, there are two in close proximity to the ego vehicle. Firstly, a dark-colored sedan is located directly in front, traveling in the same orientation and positioned in the center of the lane. The sedan's trajectory will significantly dictate the following distance and speed of the ego car. Secondly, a light-colored SUV is found in the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego car and also moving in the same direction. The presence of the SUV needs to be continuously monitored, as it may change lanes or alter its speed without warning.\n\nIn terms of vulnerable road users, there is a motorcyclist on the right side, maintaining parallel movement in the same direction as the ego car. Since motorcyclists are more exposed, the ego vehicle must exercise caution to keep a safe distance and be ready for any sudden moves the rider may execute.\n\nAlthough there are no traffic signs in the area, there is a traffic light ahead showing green for the direction the ego car is traveling in. This allows the ego vehicle to continue moving but also signals the need to stay alert for potential changes in the signal and for other road users who could be approaching the intersection.\n\nAdditionally, there are traffic cones set up on the right side of the road, marking the boundary between the driving surface and the sidewalk. These cones indicate the driving limits and reduce the drivable road width, necessitating that the ego car stays within lane boundaries and steers clear of the coned-off area.\n\nThe JSON data does not mention any barriers or other objects, indicating that there are no such road users or hindrances in the image, thus they have no impact on the ego vehicle's driving decisions in the present situation."

They can be used to separate pedestrian areas from roadways, to protect critical infrastructure, or to prevent cars from taking certain routes. In this scenario, the bollard is standing on the edge of the roadway, indicating a separation between the pedestrian zone and the area where vehicles should be driving. The presence of this bollard requires the ego car to maintain its lane and avoid encroaching into the pedestrian space for safety. It serves as a reminder to stay alert to the boundaries of the driving area and the potential presence of pedestrians.",

Given the green traffic light, the ego car can proceed but should remain alert for the traffic light's status and any unpredictable actions from other road users. Maintain a lane position that provides a safe distance from the traffic cones and areas coned-off to the right."
