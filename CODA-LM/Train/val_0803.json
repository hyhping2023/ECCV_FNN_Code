The first vehicle is a large truck ahead in the same lane as the ego car, carrying construction debris. The truck's load is slightly protruding into the ego car's lane, posing a potential hazard. The risk here is that debris could fall from the truck, creating obstacles in the lane that would affect the path of the ego car. The second vehicle is a black sedan located in the left lane adjacent to the ego car. The sedan's position is significant as it could restrict the ego car's ability to change lanes if needed to evade the truck ahead.\n\nAdditionally, there is a blue overhead gantry sign with directional information above the road. However, this sign is not immediately relevant to driving behavior at this time. It provides directions but does not impact the immediate driving decisions, posing no direct concern for safety in the current context. \n\nThe summary includes all road users within the non-empty categories from the JSON data, efficiently encapsulating their descriptions and the potential impact on the ego car's driving behavior."

This vehicle impacts the ego car's driving decisions significantly due to its large size and the potential for falling debris.
