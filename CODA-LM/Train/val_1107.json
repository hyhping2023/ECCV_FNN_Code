It is moving in the same direction and has various construction materials loaded on top, with a visible license plate at the back. This truck affects the driving behavior of the ego car as it directly impacts the speed and following distance required to maintain safety due to its size and the potential for falling debris. Additionally, there is a small, covered three-wheeled vehicle in the adjacent lane to the right of the ego car, also moving in the same direction. The size of this vehicle and the potential for unexpected maneuvers necessitate the ego car to be vigilant and ready to adjust its speed or lane position accordingly."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, identifiable by its robust build and the visible machinery on the back, such as what appears to be a crane or lift mechanism. Due to its large size and specialized equipment, this type of vehicle typically moves slower and may make unexpected stops or maneuvers at construction sites. When driving behind or near such a vehicle, it is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential slowdowns or stops. This precaution will help in avoiding accidents and ensure smoother traffic flow, especially in areas with ongoing construction activities.",

Additionally, the ego car should be cautious of any sudden stops or turns from the smaller three-wheeled vehicle. Due to the wet road conditions, the ego car should reduce speed appropriately to maintain traction and allow for safe stopping distances."
