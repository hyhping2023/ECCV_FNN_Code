Firstly, there is a red bus on the left side, occupying the adjacent lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the bus is significant as it limits the space available for the ego car to maneuver and requires the driver to remain cautious, particularly if the bus were to make any sudden stops or turns.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white car in the opposite lane, coming towards the ego car from the opposite direction. While this vehicle does not pose an immediate threat, it is important to monitor as part of the oncoming traffic, and the ego car must be ready to respond to any potential unexpected lane changes from either vehicle.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is a blue circular traffic sign with a white arrow pointing downwards and diagonally to the right, with a red and white diagonal stripe below it. This sign is instructing traffic to pass to the right of an obstacle, which in this case is a traffic island marked with orange traffic cones. The sign and cones together guide the ego car's path, ensuring that it navigates safely around the traffic island and stays out of the oncoming traffic lane.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects reported in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."
