These barriers serve to indicate that there is no pedestrian access to the guarded area behind them. For the autonomous driving system of the ego car, it is crucial to recognize these barriers as they define the pedestrian pathway and restrict pedestrian movement. This knowledge helps the vehicle to monitor for potential jaywalkers or individuals who might step into the road, ensuring the safety of all road users. There are no other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects present in the image that would affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This is a movable barrier system consisting of multiple articulated sections and typically used for access control at checkpoints, parking facilities, or entry points to restricted areas. The barrier prohibits vehicle access when lowered, indicating that drivers must stop and may not proceed past the checkpoint without proper authorization. For the ego vehicle, this barrier would require the driver to halt and potentially interact with security personnel, use an access card, or wait for a signal before the barrier is raised to allow passage.",

The presence of this barrier suggests that there is restricted access to certain areas for vehicles or pedestrians and that the ego car will not be able to pass through without proper authorization. It will influence future driving behavior by indicating that the driver should not expect to turn into the area that is blocked off by the barrier and should continue on the current path unless access is granted or does not apply to them.",
