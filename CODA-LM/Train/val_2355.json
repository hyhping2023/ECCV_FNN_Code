        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there are primarily two vehicles contributing to the road dynamics that could influence the driving behavior of the ego car.\n\nThe first vehicle identified is a large truck parked on the right side of the road. It is noteworthy because the truck’s trailer extends into the road, effectively reducing the drivable width of the lane. This situation may necessitate a lane change for the ego car to safely navigate past this obstruction.\n\nFollowing the truck, there is a car also parked on the right side further ahead. Unlike the truck, the car does not obstruct the lane. However, its presence is still significant for the ego car’s situational awareness. It is essential for the ego car to acknowledge the parked car to prepare for any unforeseen movements or scenarios that could arise.\n\nOther categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects have not been reported in this particular scene. Therefore, the focus remains on navigating past the parked vehicles, particularly the large truck, with heightened awareness and caution."

It usually serves the purpose of transporting a variety of goods over long distances. When operating near such vehicles, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be cautious of wide turns that trucks commonly make. The presence of this truck in this scenario suggests that the driver of the ego car should be prepared for potential slow-moving traffic and maintain vigilance for sudden stops or turns the truck might make.",
