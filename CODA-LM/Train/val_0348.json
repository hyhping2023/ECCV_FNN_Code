Directly in front of the ego vehicle, there is a red car traveling in the same direction. The presence of this car is important as it sets the following distance and can influence the ego vehicle's braking or when performing lane changes. Further ahead, there are white vehicles located in the same lane as the ego car and the adjoining left lane. These vehicles affect how the ego vehicle adjusts its speed and determines the best lane to maintain a safe traveling distance and area for potential maneuvers.\n\nAdditionally, there are overhead directional signs that are indicating highway junctions or exits. These signs are crucial for the ego car's navigation decisions, as they provide the necessary information to anticipate and prepare for any lane changes well in advance to follow the intended route.\n\nFinally, there is an object on the road's surface in the right lane that looks like a suitcase or some type of debris. This obstacle is a hazard, and the ego vehicle must respond appropriately by avoiding it to prevent possible damage and to maintain the safety of itself and other road users. \n\nThere is no mention of vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers in the scene, indicating that these elements are not present in this particular traffic image."
