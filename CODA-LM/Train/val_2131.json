On the right side of the road, adjacent to the driving lane, there is a line of parked motorcycles and scooters. The proximity of these vehicles to the driving lane is a potential hazard, as there is a risk that users may enter the road unexpectedly, or the motorcycles and scooters could encroach into the lane.\n\nAdditionally, there are several individuals, likely the riders of the parked motorcycles and scooters, standing or moving near these parked vehicles on the right side, close to the active roadway. The presence of these vulnerable road users indicates the possibility of them entering or crossing the road, which requires the ego car to drive cautiously.\n\nFurthermore, orange traffic cones are placed in a line on the right, separating the roadway from a blocked-off area. These cones suggest that there might be a section of the road or shoulder that is under construction or designated for a particular use. This arrangement reduces the usable width of the road for the ego car.\n\nLastly, red and white traffic barriers are set up along the edge of the right lane, restricting vehicle and pedestrian access. These barriers clearly demarcate the boundary between the vehicle lane and the restricted area. They signal the ego car to stay within the lane boundaries and to be alert for any unexpected intrusions.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the image that affect driving behavior."

Additionally, the ego car should reduce speed if necessary and remain vigilant to ensure it is ready to react to any unexpected pedestrian movement. Due to traffic barriers, it is advisable to stay within the lane marks and avoid any maneuvers that could bring the car into the restricted areas. Keeping a slower speed in this section is recommended until the environment becomes less complex and restrictive."
