These traffic signs instruct the ego vehicle to prepare for a mandatory right turn and prohibit movement to the left.\n\nOrange and white traffic cones are aligned on the left side of the ego vehicle, forming a barrier. These cones indicate a closed or restricted lane, guiding the ego vehicle to stay in or shift away from the affected lane.\n\nThere are yellow barriers on the sidewalk to the right, along with construction signs, indicating an active work zone. This situation requires caution and readiness to stop or slow down due to the potential for pedestrians or equipment entering the roadway.\n\nLastly, pedestrian fencing is present along the construction area, delineating the walkway and work zones.
