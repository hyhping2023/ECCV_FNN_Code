The truck's red rear lights are visible, which suggests that it is either moving slowly or has come to a stop. The presence of this large vehicle directly ahead is significant as it limits the visibility and maneuvering space for the ego vehicle. Consequently, the ego vehicle must approach with caution and maintain a safe following distance to ensure safety on the road. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Due to its size and potential cargo load, the truck may accelerate slowly and take longer to stop compared to smaller vehicles. For the ego car, maintaining a safe following distance is crucial to accommodate for these factors and to respond safely to any sudden changes in the truck's speed or direction.",

It should be prepared to respond to the truck's brake lights if the truck slows down or stops suddenly. The ego vehicle's headlights and taillights should be on to ensure visibility to other road users. Additionally, the ego car should keep a lookout for any possible maneuvers the truck might make and be ready to react accordingly."
