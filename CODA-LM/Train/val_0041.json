Additionally, there are yellow and black traffic cones on the right side marking a boundary, limiting the lane's usable width and necessitating caution to avoid collisions. A white and red barrier is situated in front of the pedestrian area to the right, indicating that this area is off-limits to vehicles, thereby ensuring the ego car does not veer into it. Lastly, a dustbin is located on the right sidewalk, which doesn't directly impact the driving behavior but should be noted in case any debris around it could potentially enter the roadway."

It usually is made up of a plastic or rubber base with a bright orange or yellow body featuring reflective strips for increased visibility. In this case, the presence of the traffic cone indicates that there might be road work ahead, an obstruction on the road, or a need to merge into another lane. The ego car must be prepared to slow down, proceed with caution, and potentially change lanes to avoid the area marked by the cone.",

In the context of road traffic, bollards are used to control or direct road traffic, such as guiding pedestrian traffic, or restricting vehicle access to certain areas. It implies that the ego car should not drive over or beyond this point, indicating a boundary for pedestrian areas or a no access zone for vehicles.",
