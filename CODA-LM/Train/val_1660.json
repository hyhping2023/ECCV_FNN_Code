        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there are several road users and objects of interest. Firstly, there is a group of pedestrians standing by the side of the road, appearing to be waiting to cross. The presence of pedestrians is significant as they can unpredictably enter the roadway, which poses potential risks for moving vehicles. Drivers must be vigilant and prepared to stop if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, a cyclist is observed on the side of the road, moving parallel to the roadway. Cyclists share the road with vehicles, and their presence necessitates careful driving to ensure safety. Drivers should maintain a safe distance and be aware of the potential for cyclists to change direction or stop.\n\nAlthough there are no vehicles or traffic signs in the image, there is a mention of traffic lights ahead, which are currently not visible. Traffic lights are essential for controlling the flow of vehicles and pedestrians, and they are critical to observe for understanding right of way and determining when to stop or go.\n\nFurthermore, two traffic cones are placed on the side of the road, not obstructing the car lanes. While they are not currently a direct obstacle, traffic cones generally indicate areas where caution is required, likely due to maintenance or road work. Drivers should be alert for potential changes in road conditions or unexpected obstructions.\n\nThere are no barriers or other objects reported in the image."

Continuously monitor for traffic lights or signs that might come into view and comply with their indications. Approach the area with the traffic cones cautiously, being alert to possible road work or changes in traffic patterns ahead."
