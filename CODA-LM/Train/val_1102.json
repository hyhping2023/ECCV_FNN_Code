Additionally, there is a second truck on the right, facing the first truck with its front end angled towards the road. This truck's positioning can affect the drivable space on the road and may indicate an active loading or unloading situation, which requires caution.\n\nThere are also two individuals standing between the trucks on the side of the road. One is wearing a white t-shirt, and the other is in blue workwear. They might unexpectedly enter the roadway, so their presence requires careful monitoring by the ego vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, a traffic cone is down on the ground between the trucks. The cone indicates a potential road hazard or ongoing work, necessitating reduced speed and increased attentiveness from the ego vehicle.\n\nLastly, there is a makeshift barrier made of a metal frame lying in front of the ego vehicle. This barrier signifies road work or a closed lane ahead, and it dictates that the ego vehicle should not proceed forward along this path.\n\nThe traffic image does not contain any traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects that need to be considered in this summary."
