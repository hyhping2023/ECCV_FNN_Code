Firstly, there is a truck directly ahead in the same lane, which is either moving or stopped in traffic. The truck is loaded with various items, and its position and load may affect the ego car's ability to overtake safely or maintain an adequate following distance. Additionally, there is a black car on the right side of the road, which may be parked or moving slowly in traffic. The presence of the black car requires vigilance as it could make sudden movements, merge back into traffic, or open its doors, all of which the ego car should be prepared to respond to.\n\nThere is also a pedestrian on the right side, walking away from the road. Although the pedestrian is not currently on the road, the ego car must remain alert in case the pedestrian decides to cross or step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\nLastly, the image contains possible reflections and light transparencies on the windshield, which could obscure the vision. These visual obstructions can impair the sensors of the ego car or the driver's ability to perceive other road users and the environment accurately, necessitating caution.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers present in the image that need to be considered."
