The stopped position of the truck may obstruct part of the lane, necessitating caution from passing drivers who might need to change lanes to avoid it safely.\n\nAdditionally, there is a vulnerable road user present, identified as a worker or construction crew member. This individual is wearing a green safety vest and is standing near the stopped truck. The presence of the pedestrian worker near the truck increases the need for vigilance among drivers. It may also require them to slow down to ensure the safety of the worker.\n\nNo other road users, including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or any other objects, were reported in the traffic image, indicating their absence from the scene or their lack of relevance to the driving conditions around the ego car."
