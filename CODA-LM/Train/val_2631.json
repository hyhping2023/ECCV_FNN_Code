It is generally used for preventing vehicles from driving too close to the edge of the road, thereby protecting pedestrians and nearby properties. For the ego car, the presence of this bollard dictates cautious driving to ensure the vehicle does not collide with it, especially in a narrow road situation such as this, where space might be limited. This object serves as a guide for maintaining a safe distance from the roadside boundaries.",
