Directly ahead in the right lane, there is a large commercial truck characterized by its elevated structure and container. The truck's brake lights are active, suggesting it is either slowing down or stopped. This situation necessitates the ego vehicle to possibly adjust its speed and consider a lane change to maintain a safe distance or pass the truck.\n\nAdditionally, there is a green-lit traffic sign on the right side of the road at a distance, seemingly positioned above or beyond the truck. This sign could indicate an exit or directional information, suggesting that the ego car may need to perform lane adjustments if it intends to follow the indicated direction.\n\nA metal guardrail is also visible on the right side, defining the road's edge and marking the boundary of the drivable area. This informs the ego car's lateral placement within the lane to avoid potential collisions."

This type of vehicle is commonly used in road work or construction sites and can be identified by its robust build and often bright, reflective colors intended to enhance visibility. In driving scenarios, especially at night as observed in this image, the presence of a construction vehicle can indicate ongoing road work or a potential obstacle. This requires the ego car to possibly slow down, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for sudden stops or detours, enhancing safety in areas where construction work is underway.",
