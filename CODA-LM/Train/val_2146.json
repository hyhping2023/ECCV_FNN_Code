The first is a white sedan, positioned directly ahead of the ego car and parked facing the same direction. The presence of this parked sedan suggests the need for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and approach with caution since it may begin to move or someone could open a door. Secondly, a white SUV is partially visible, parked with its front facing towards a building and located behind the sedan. The SUV is currently stationary, but the ego car must remain alert to any sudden movements that could influence its driving path.\n\nAdditionally, there's a pedestrian accompanied by a dog on the sidewalk, also on the right side, who is walking away from the ego car. Due to the unpredictability of the pedestrian and the dog's movements—as they could potentially change direction or step onto the road—there is a necessity for the ego car to reduce speed and keep a watchful eye on them.\n\nMoreover, the ego car needs to come to a halt as instructed by the red traffic light that is visible straight ahead in its lane. The vehicle must wait for the signal to turn green before proceeding further. \n\nAll other categories such as traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects are not present in this scene according to the provided data."
