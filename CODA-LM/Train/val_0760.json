This vehicle is either slowing down or stopped, suggesting a potential traffic situation that requires the ego car's immediate attention.\n\nAdditionally, an oncoming vehicle with its headlights on is approaching from the opposite direction, necessitating that the ego car maintains its lane and considers its speed and positioning, especially under low visibility conditions such as nighttime.\n\nFurthermore, a pedestrian is observed walking along the edge of the road directly in the path of the ego car. The pedestrian's close proximity to the travel lane and their unpredictable movements pose a potential hazard, prompting the ego car to potentially slow down or stop to ensure safety."

The ego car should activate its hazard lights to alert other road users of the potential hazard ahead. The ego car should also ensure that it remains within its lane to avoid the oncoming vehicle and follow traffic rules for nighttime driving and pedestrian right-of-way. It is crucial to monitor the pedestrian closely and be prepared for any sudden movements that could further affect the driving behavior."
