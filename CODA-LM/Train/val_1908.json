The stationary nature of the SUV necessitates an adjustment in the ego vehicleâ€™s driving, such as preparing to change lanes or modifying speed to safely navigate around the potential obstacle.\n\nMeanwhile, there are also vulnerable road users present. They consist of a pedestrian with a dog who is walking on the sidewalk parallel to the road, situated to the right of the ego car. Although the pedestrian and their dog are not currently affecting the traffic, their movements should be continuously observed. There is a risk they may choose to cross the road or the dog might venture onto the roadway, both situations requiring the ego car to be ready to react.\n\nAdditionally, there is a traffic sign visible on the right, which is a blue parking sign with the letter 'P' symbolizing a parking area. The sign suggests that there might be vehicles slowing down to park or pulling out of parking spots, which could impact the flow of traffic and necessitate the ego car to anticipate and respond to such changes in the environment.\n\nOther categories such as traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, and other objects do not contain any elements in this particular image and therefore are not factors influencing driving behaviors in the current scenario."
