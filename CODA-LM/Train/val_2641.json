It is critical for the ego car to maintain a safe distance as construction vehicles often make unexpected stops and starts and can expose surrounding traffic to hazards like debris falling off the truck. Additionally, these vehicles frequently reduce speed to maneuver or turn into construction sites, potentially impacting the flow of traffic. Safe driving protocols recommend staying alert around such larger vehicles and being prepared for sudden or slow movements.",
