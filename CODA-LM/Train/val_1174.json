This indicates that they are either at a standstill or moving very slowly in the same direction as the autonomous car. This situation requires the autonomous vehicle to be alert for possible stop-and-go traffic, necessitating a reduction in speed and readiness to stop to maintain safety.\n\nTraffic Cones:\nReflective traffic cones are positioned on the right edge of the autonomous car's current lane. These cones are signaling that the autonomous car should remain in its lane and avoid veering right due to potential road works or some type of road obstruction.\n\nOther Objects:\nFinally, garbage bins are present on the sidewalk to the right side of the road. Although they are not obstructing the autonomous carâ€™s path, they warrant attention as pedestrians may approach the bins unexpectedly, which could affect the driving environment."

Dustbins are essential for public sanitation, serving as collection points for garbage to keep the environment clean. For drivers, the placement of a dustbin near the curb may indicate the presence of pedestrian activity, as individuals typically access these bins on foot. Consequently, the ego car should proceed with heightened alertness in this area to accommodate for potential pedestrians who might approach the dustbin, especially in low light conditions. Maintaining a safe driving speed and readiness to halt if necessary are prudent behaviors to ensure both pedestrian and driver safety.",

The car should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead, be prepared to stop if traffic conditions require, and adhere to the boundaries set by the traffic cones. Due to the wet road surface, the vehicle should lower its speed to accommodate increased braking distances and prevent hydroplaning. Additionally, while the garbage bins themselves are not on the road, the vehicle should be vigilant of any pedestrians that may emerge from the sidewalk area near these bins."
