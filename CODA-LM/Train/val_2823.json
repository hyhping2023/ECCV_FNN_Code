The first is a large truck or construction vehicle with 'ANGOS' written on its side, which is positioned in front of the ego car on the road. The presence of this large vehicle could obstruct visibility for the ego car and block its path, necessitating caution. The ego car may need to change lanes or slow down to maintain a safe following distance due to the truck's size and position.\n\nAdditionally, there is a red car directly in front of the ego car, which has its brake lights illuminated. This indicates that the red car is either slowing down or has come to a stop. Consequently, the ego car must be prepared to slow down or stop as well to avoid a potential rear-end collision, as the red car's brake lights are a clear signal of its reduced speed or halt."
