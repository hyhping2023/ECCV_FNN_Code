This barrier signifies potential construction or roadwork ahead, which could lead to lane closures or shifts, requiring the ego car to reduce speed and increase vigilance for any road workers or machinery."

It is equipped with a rotating drum used for mixing cement components to produce concrete. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road can indicate nearby road work or construction sites. In driving scenarios, encountering such a vehicle may require additional caution from the driver of the ego car. This can include maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for potential sudden stops or reduced speeds, due to the possibility of this vehicle making frequent stops or maneuvers related to construction activities.",
