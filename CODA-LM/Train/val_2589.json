A red bus parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the ego vehicle with its rear lights on. This bus is stationary and doesn't currently pose a moving hazard, but its position near the edge of the driving lane could potentially obstruct the ego car's path or reduce visibility.\n2. A white van parked ahead on the left side of the road, facing towards the ego vehicle. The van is also stationary and appears to be parked. Nevertheless, its orientation towards the ego car necessitates monitoring in case it starts moving.\n\nIn the barriers category, there is:\n1. A white and yellow barrier placed on the right side of the road, near the bus. This barrier suggests a potential roadwork or hazard area, which might narrow the driving path for the ego car and requires cautious driving. \n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or additional other objects in the scene."
