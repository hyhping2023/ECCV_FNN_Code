        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, several road users and objects are noted, each influencing the behavior of our ego vehicle in different ways.\n\nFirstly, there's a white car parked on the right side, just slightly ahead of the ego vehicle and on the edge of a designated parking zone. While this car does not currently affect the flow of traffic, the driver of our ego car needs to be vigilant as the car might merge back into traffic, and it's also important to avoid unintentionally drifting into the parking zone.\n\nAdditionally, there is a truck further down the same lane as the ego car, appearing to be stationary or moving very slowly. This could potentially block the path of the ego vehicle, necessitating a possible stop or lane change to navigate around it.\n\nRegarding signage, there is a blue circular sign with a white arrow indicating the directions the traffic is permitted to take â€“ straight or turn left, prohibiting a right turn which will guide the future route choices. Another traffic sign with a red border and blue center implies a mandatory left due to roadwork, directing the ego vehicle to stay on the left.\n\nNo traffic lights relevant to the ego vehicle's immediate direction of travel are visible in this scene, which means they do not influence current driving decisions.\n\nThe presence of a series of red and white traffic cones suggests road work is being performed on the right side of the road, hinting at a lane closure and the need for caution and a possible merge to the left. Complementing these are portable metal barriers, reinforcing the lane closure and emphasizing the restriction from entering the work area.\n\nLastly, snow accumulation is seen along the sides of the road; this calls for extra care as the space for shoulders is reduced and there could be obscured hazards or the chance of unexpected movements from other road users.\n\nOverall, careful attention is required while navigating through this area with ongoing road work, restricted lanes, and specific directional signage, all while considering potential movements of parked vehicles and the implications of roadside snow."
