This indicates that it might either be braking or the lights are on due to low visibility. The ego car must maintain a safe distance to prepare for any potential sudden stops by the truck.\n   - A car is partially visible on the right side ahead with its headlights on, suggesting either low visibility conditions or that it is currently in operation. The ego car should monitor this vehicle's movements to anticipate any lane changes or speed adjustments.\n\n2. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Multiple traffic cones are placed along the left-hand side road barrier, which might indicate a construction zone or a road narrowing. The ego car needs to stay in its lane and potentially reduce speed to ensure safe passage through this constricted section of the road.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - There is a continuous red and white barrier running along both sides of the road, possibly indicating a construction area or lane demarcations. The ego car must stay within these barriers as they designate the boundary of the drivable road surface."
