The vehicles consist of several parked vehicles on the right side of the road, which are white and grey in color, facing the same direction as the ego vehicle. These parked vehicles are significant as they occupy potential parking or stopping space and introduce a risk of suddenly opened doors, which could pose a risk of collision. Additionally, there is a white car traveling ahead in the same lane as the ego car, going in the same direction. The ego vehicle needs to consider this car when adjusting its speed and following distance.\n\nOn the left side of the ego carâ€™s lane, there are orange traffic cones lined up, signaling a possible lane closure or roadwork ahead. The presence of these traffic cones requires the ego vehicle to stay alert and potentially change lanes if it's necessary to do so. \n\nMoreover, metal guardrails are seen on the right, delineating the separation between the parked vehicles and the pedestrian walkway. These barriers are important as they clearly define the edge of the road and prevent vehicles from entering the pedestrian area.\n\nThe image does not feature any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects."

            "description and explanation": "This object is identified as a bollard. Bollards are short, sturdy vertical posts installed to control road traffic and prevent vehicles from entering specific areas. In this context, the bollard serves to demarcate the boundary between the road and a pedestrian area or sidewalk, ensuring that vehicles do not encroach onto spaces not intended for vehicular traffic. This encourages a safe passage for pedestrians and maintains organized vehicle flow. The presence of bollards influences the driving behavior by limiting where the ego vehicle can drive, signaling that the area beyond the bollard is restricted for vehicles.",
