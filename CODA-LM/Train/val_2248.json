The presence of such a vehicle suggests that there might be construction activities nearby or that it is transporting its mixture to a construction site. For the ego vehicle, this indicates the necessity to maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle, as these types of vehicles can start and stop unexpectedly, especially when approaching construction zones. Additionally, the potential for debris falling from such a vehicle could pose a risk, requiring increased attention and readiness to adapt speed or change lanes if safe to do so.",

Continue following the traffic light signal which is currently green, but proceed with caution due to the wet road conditions. Keep aware of the cyclist to the right for situational awareness without immediate action required."
