Specifically, a series of orange and white traffic cones are arranged in a pattern on the right side of the road, indicating lane closure or narrowing. These cones are directing traffic to move left, thereby affecting the lane availability for the ego car by steering it away from potential hazards or ongoing road works. Additionally, there are temporary fencing or barriers also located on the right side of the road. These barriers indicate that part of the road or sidewalk is under construction and is hence closed, which may narrow the usable road space for vehicles and affect the overall traffic flow."

            "description and explanation": "The object is identified as a traffic cone, which is typically used in road settings to mark temporary zones of caution or construction. Made of bright orange material, often with a white reflective stripe, it serves as a visual alert to drivers to veer away or slow down in its vicinity. This cone's presence in the scene may indicate ongoing roadwork, an accident ahead, or changes in usual traffic patterns. The ego car must adjust its driving path to avoid this obstacle and possibly reduce speed due to potential hazards or construction workers nearby.",

It is often orange and made from a lightweight plastic material, which makes it easily noticeable and movable. In this scenario, this cone could indicate that there are roadworks ahead or that this part of the lane is closed, requiring vehicles to maneuver around it or switch lanes if necessary to continue passage safely.",

It should also follow the direction indicated by the traffic cones, moving to the left to avoid the closed-off area while being vigilant for any changes in traffic patterns or unexpected road users emerging from the construction zone. Use of low beam headlights for visibility if not already in use, and maintain a safe distance from any vehicles ahead to react appropriately to their movements."
