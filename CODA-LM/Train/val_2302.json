It's important to constantly monitor this van due to its proximity and movement, as it may execute lane changes or other maneuvers that could influence our driving decisions. Moreover, there is a mention of a blue vehicle that is partially visible in front of this van, suggesting the presence of another vehicle ahead which should also be considered when planning the autonomous vehicle's actions. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects identified in this image that require attention."
