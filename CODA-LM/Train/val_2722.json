The information on these signs could be crucial for the ego car's route planning as they might specify lane usage or provide directions."

It is a common type of machinery used in various construction tasks such as lifting, digging, or transporting building materials. The presence of this construction vehicle on the road affects driving behavior as it usually moves slowly and requires extra caution from nearby drivers.
