It can indicate areas that are unsafe or where workers may be present, and its bright color and reflective material make it highly visible to drivers. The presence of the traffic cone suggests that there may be some form of road work or obstacle further along the road, requiring drivers to be cautious and possibly change lanes if necessary.",
