The truck's large size may obstruct the ego car's view ahead and necessitate increased following distance to ensure safe stopping times and distances.\n   - Additionally, a smaller white van is located on the left-hand side of the frame, one lane over to the left of the ego car, traveling in the same direction. This van may impede the ego car's ability to change lanes to the left if there is a need to overtake the concrete mixer truck.\n\n2. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - Various road signs are mounted on the right side of the road ahead, including directional signs indicating lane destinations. These signs are essential for informing the ego car about upcoming road layouts, potential lane changes, and necessary precautions to be taken in advance.\n\n3. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - A set of traffic lights is positioned ahead, mounted above the road, displaying a green light for the lane in which the ego car is currently positioned. The green light signifies that it is permissible for the ego car to proceed, yet it is important to stay attentive to possible light changes and the reactions of other vehicles.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - Orange barriers are placed on the right-hand side of the road, marking out construction work at the roadside. These barriers highlight potential hazards or modifications in the road layout, requiring the ego car to maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions or entering restricted areas."
