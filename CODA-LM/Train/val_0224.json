This bus could be loading or unloading passengers and might remain stationary for a while or move unpredictably if it starts to merge back into traffic.\n\nAdditionally, there is a sedan to the right of the ego vehicle, positioned slightly ahead in an adjacent lane, also directed towards the ego car's direction of travel. The close proximity and potential actions of this sedan can affect the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver.\n\nOn the right sidewalk, a large group of pedestrians is gathered, with some looking to cross and a traffic police officer present to coordinate or manage pedestrian movements. This indicates potential pedestrian crossing activity, which could lead to sudden stops in traffic to allow the pedestrians to cross safely.\n\nTraffic lights are present overhead, although their state is not visible in the image.

It should also monitor the actions of the sedan in the adjacent lane, in case it decides to merge. The vehicle should remain observant of the traffic light, even though its state is not visible in the image. Additionally, the driver or autonomous system should be ready to stop for pedestrians that may enter the crosswalk under the traffic officer's guidance. Lastly, the ego car should not attempt to merge into the lane designated by traffic cones unless directed by a traffic officer or road signage. Overall, the ego car should proceed with caution, prepared to stop or adjust speed based on the actions of the bus, sedan, pedestrians, and traffic signals."
