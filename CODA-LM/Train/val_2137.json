It is displaying its rear lights and is likely moving at a slower speed due to its size and function. The presence of this oversized vehicle impacts the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating an increased following distance and reduced speed. Additionally, the truck may obscure the visibility of the road ahead for the ego car. There are no other road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Located on a road, this vehicle is typically used for roadworks or maintenance tasks. Its presence on the road indicates that some form of construction or repair work is likely occurring, which may influence driving behavior by necessitating reduced speeds, increased caution, and potentially a change of lanes to maintain safety distances from the vehicle and any nearby workers.",
