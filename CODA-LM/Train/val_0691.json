These barriers are designed to separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions and provide a safety measure to prevent vehicles from crossing into oncoming traffic. Given the visibility and prominent color, they also serve as visual guides to aid drivers in maintaining lane discipline. These barriers will influence the ego car's driving behavior by ensuring the vehicle stays within designated lanes, promoting safer travel especially in sections with adjacent construction or heavy vehicle movement.",

Typically used in heavy construction and excavating tasks, the presence of this vehicle indicates ongoing construction work nearby.

It appears to be made of durable, heavy-duty plastic in a vivid red color, possibly to enhance visibility. Barriers like this are typically used to separate different lanes of traffic, prevent vehicles from entering construction sites adjacent to the roadway, or to redirect traffic flow safely around obstacles or during road work. For the ego car, this barrier impacts driving behavior by delineating the drivable area of the road and ensuring the vehicle remains within the safe confines of the designated traffic lane, thereby preventing any accidental divergence into oncoming lanes or restricted areas.",
