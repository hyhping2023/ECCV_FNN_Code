The first is a large red construction crane truck with its boom extended, parked on the shoulder of the highway. This construction vehicle poses a potential hazard and may require drivers to slow down or change lanes to maintain a safe clearance distance. The second vehicle is a dark-colored sedan traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle on the highway. The presence of this sedan necessitates maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for any potential sudden braking or lane changes by the sedan. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."

Given its size and the complex equipment it carries, it could influence the future driving behavior by necessitating increased following distance and general caution by the ego car. Such a vehicle may also impact lane usage, as it could require additional space for maneuvering or could be moving slower than the general flow of traffic.",
