        "description and explanation": "In the current traffic scenario, there are several road users and signs present that the ego car must be aware of for safe navigation. There is one orange forklift located on the left side of the road, traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The forklift's forks are raised, suggesting it is not carrying a load at the moment. Given that forklifts typically operate at lower speeds and could make unpredictable maneuvers, the ego car must remain vigilant around it.\n\nAlso in view is a white car proceeding in the opposite direction on the other side of the road. The car is staying within its lane, and while it doesn't pose a direct influence on the ego car's immediate driving decisions, the ego car should still keep an eye on it to ensure a safe passing distance.\n\nOn the flip side of the road, a large yellow construction vehicle is stationed, facing away from the ego vehicle's traveling direction. Even though there is no apparent activity near the parked vehicle, the ego car should be alert to any sudden movements or personnel entering the road from around the construction vehicle.\n\nAs far as signage is concerned, a yellow diamond-shaped warning sign is positioned on the right ahead, facing the direction in which the ego car is headed. This sign highlights the need for the ego car to be prepared for possible hazards or alterations in driving conditions that could occur shortly.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned road users and signs, there are barriers located on the right side of the road. While these barriers are not directly obstructing the ego car's path, they might imply the presence of road works or other obstructions that are not immediately visible, which warrants additional caution.\n\nThe traffic scene does not encompass any vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, or other miscellaneous objects that impact the ego vehicle's driving behavior."
