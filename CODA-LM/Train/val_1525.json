However, there are significant temporary traffic management objects that influence driving behavior. A temporary traffic light on a mobile stand displays a green arrow pointing to the right, indicating that the ego car is required to proceed but must turn right due to roadwork or an obstruction ahead. Accompanying this, there is a yellow and black striped barrier with attached traffic cones, signifying a diversion or closed lane that necessitates vehicles to deviate from their usual path. Additionally, a mobile barrier setup on the road, which includes an attached traffic light, is observed. This setup likely indicates temporary road work or a lane closure, demanding that drivers alter their route accordingly. There are no traffic signs, traffic cones without barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data that affect the driving environment."

The green light indicates that vehicles facing the light may proceed through the intersection or along the direction it indicates, typically following the flow of the traffic lanes it controls.
