The purpose of this bollard in the traffic scene is to prevent vehicles from driving over the curb onto pedestrian or restricted areas, thereby enhancing safety by creating a physical barrier between vehicular and non-vehicular zones. For the ego car, the presence of this bollard influences driving behavior by indicating areas that are off-limits for vehicular traffic, thus the driver should ensure not to swerve close to the curb near the bollard to avoid any collisions.",

Stay in the correct lane as indicated by the overhead directional signs, prepare for future maneuvers as needed. Since the traffic light is green, the ego car should continue, but monitor the light for any changes. Keep to the driving lanes, respecting the no parking sign and the barriers on the median strip. Regularly scan the road for any unexpected obstacles or changes in traffic conditions."
