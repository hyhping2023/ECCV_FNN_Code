It is positioned partly on the sidewalk and partly on the road, and it is facing the direction of the ego car. This vehicle is significant in size and, because of its location, could potentially obstruct the lane or create a hazard if it were to move or turn unexpectedly.\n\nAlthough there is a single street light visible on the right side of the road ahead, there are no traffic signs that can be clearly identified. In this case, the ego car must rely on the default road rules while navigating the area, as no specific instructions from traffic signs are available.\n\nMoreover, no traffic lights are present in the image, which implies that the ego car should adhere to the general traffic rules in the absence of such signals.\n\nThe sidewalks on both sides of the road are lined with metal fencing. This barrier could indicate the presence of construction or restricted areas near the roadway, which might influence road safety. The fencing also clearly demarcates the edges of the road.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, or other objects visible in this traffic image."
