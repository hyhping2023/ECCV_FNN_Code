This bus is stationary, necessitating the ego car to maintain its lane position to avoid proximity. Additionally, a sanitation truck is parked further ahead on the right, near some construction work. This truck suggests the presence of workers and potential changes in traffic patterns.\n\nWithin the vulnerable road users category, there are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists. Thus, the ego car can proceed with standard caution while driving.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, a mandatory direction road sign on the right sidewalk indicates that the road turns right. This sign informs the ego car that a right turn ahead is the only legal maneuver.\n\nIn the traffic lights category, there are no traffic lights visible in the image. The absence of traffic lights indicates that traffic regulation will be managed by the mandatory direction sign and on-road markings.\n\nTraffic cones, along with a barrier on the left side of the road, indicate a delineated work area. These cones and barriers suggest that a section of the road is not accessible, likely due to construction, affecting the available lanes for navigation.\n\nAdditionally, a barrier running along with the traffic cones partially obstructs the left lane. This barrier indicates that lane changes may be required, reducing the usable width of the road.\n\nLastly, in the other objects category, multiple dustbins are placed on the sidewalk alongside the construction barriers. While these dustbins don't directly affect the drive path, they should be noted as they could impact visibility or pedestrian movement."

Attention should be paid to the right-turn-only signage, preparing to make a legal maneuver as indicated. The presence of the parked vehicles and construction work suggests the likelihood of reduced road width or intermittent obstructions, so the ego car should be prepared to adjust its lane position safely. The lack of visible vulnerable road users does not diminish the need for vigilance, as construction areas often have pedestrians. Finally, standard checks for any traffic lights or signs that may come into view should be conducted as the vehicle proceeds."
