The concrete mixer truck, being large, might slow down or stop for work-related activities, creating a potential obstruction.\n  - The rickshaw, which is visible on the left of the concrete mixer truck, poses a risk due to unpredictable movement or potential stops. Its smaller size and less visibility require careful monitoring for erratic movement patterns. \n\n- **Vulnerable Road Users**: \n  - A pedestrian, who appears to be a construction worker wearing an orange jacket, is on the sidewalk to the right. Being close to the road while engaged in work-related activities may lead to unexpected road entry, posing a risk.\n\n- **Traffic Cones**: \n  - Orange traffic cones are placed along the right edge of the road, suggesting potential road work or changes in the traffic pattern ahead. These cones indicate areas that vehicles should avoid, potentially narrowing the usable road space.\n\nNo traffic signs, traffic lights, barriers, or other objects are identified in this traffic image."
