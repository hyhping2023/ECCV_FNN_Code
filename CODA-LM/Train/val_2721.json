        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, there is a notable presence of a yellow construction vehicle equipped with a crane, occupying the right lane ahead of the ego vehicle and moving in the same direction. The size and operational pace of the construction vehicle suggest it may travel slower than the regular flow of traffic, heralding potential obstructions or the necessity for sudden stops. Consequently, it is pivotal for the ego car to ensure a safe following distance is maintained and to stay alert for opportunities to change lanes if required to navigate around the slower-moving vehicle safely.\n\nAdditionally, a directional sign located on the right side of the road becomes apparent, signifying an imminent split in the road or an upcoming exit. This disclosure necessitates the ego vehicle to be cognizant of the forthcoming change in the road layout and to position itself appropriately in the correct lane to adhere to its intended route without disruption.\n\nThe scene is exclusive of any other categories such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, focusing the attention solely on the interaction with the described construction vehicle and the adherence to road signs indicating changes in the road's structure."

It features a bright yellow color for high visibility and has multiple articulations designed for lifting heavy materials. The construction vehicle is larger and moves more slowly than typical road vehicles, which requires other drivers to maintain heightened awareness and possibly adjust their speed or change lanes to safely navigate around it, ensuring adequate clearance and reacting to its movements attentively.",
