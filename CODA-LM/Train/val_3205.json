Its large size and turning maneuver influence the flow of traffic, requiring other vehicles, including the ego car, to yield and possibly stop to allow the truck to complete its turn safely.\n2. **Small blue motorcycle:** This motorcycle, with two occupants, is directly in front of the ego vehicle, preparing to navigate around the turning truck. Given the motorcycle's proximity and potential vulnerability, the ego car must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden movements.\n\n**Vulnerable Road Users:**\n1. **Pedestrian:** A pedestrian wearing a yellow hat and dark clothing appears to be crossing the street in the distance to the left of the ego vehicle. The pedestrian's presence requires the ego car to remain vigilant and be prepared to slow down or stop should the pedestrian enter the path of the vehicle.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image."
