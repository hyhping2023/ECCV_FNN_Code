A white pickup truck on the left lane, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. It is carrying a load of metallic objects, possibly ladders or pipes, which protrude from the bed of the truck and appear potentially unstable. This truck's location and load could affect the driving decisions of the ego car, requiring increased following distance and preparedness for possible debris falling onto the roadway.\n2. A yellow heavy construction vehicle on the right lane, parallel to the ego vehicle. This vehicle occupies part of the lane with its wide structure. The presence of this construction vehicle and the space it occupies necessitate caution and possibly changing lanes to maintain a safe passing distance.\n\nAdditionally, there is a series of orange traffic cones placed on the right side of the right lane, indicating a construction or work area ahead. These cones delineate a section of the roadway that is either under maintenance or designated for construction vehicles, indicating to drivers, including the ego car, to move over to the left to avoid the coned-off area."

The driver should also pay attention to any changes in the traffic pattern and watch for potential debris from the pickup truck's load. It's crucial to follow any temporary signage or signals that might be present in a construction zone which are not visible in the current view."
