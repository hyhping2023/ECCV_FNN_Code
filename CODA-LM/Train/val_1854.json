A black sedan directly ahead of the ego car on the same lane, moving in the same direction. The ego car needs to maintain a safe following distance from this vehicle and be prepared to stop if necessary.\n3. A yellow arm crane truck parked on the right side of the road, occupying part of the lane. The ego car may need to change lanes to the left to safely pass the crane truck if the space is too narrow.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, there are no pedestrians, cyclists, or motorcyclists visible in the scene, so no action is needed concerning them.\n\nFor traffic signs, a traffic signal ahead is displaying a red light, indicating the ego car must prepare to stop.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light directly ahead in the center of the image also shows a red signal, requiring the ego car to come to a complete stop at the intersection. \n\nNo traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scene."

For the driver of the ego car, this could imply several adjustments to driving behavior such as reducing speed, being vigilant for sudden stops or detours, and paying attention to workers or other machinery entering the roadway. The large size and slow moving nature of construction vehicles also require other traffic participants to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to yield.",
