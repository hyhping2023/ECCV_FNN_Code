However, there are neither vehicles nor traffic lights present in this scene.\n\nA pedestrian is standing on the right side of the road. It seems that they intend to cross, as evidenced by their position, but their attention is diverted to their phone. This distraction could raise the risk of an accident if the pedestrian were to step onto the road without noticing the oncoming autonomous vehicle.\n\nNear this pedestrian, there is a traffic sign that advises against pedestrian crossing at that location. This implies that the pedestrian might be considering ignoring the traffic rules, further increasing the potential hazard.\n\nAlong the same side of the road, there are multiple yellow and black traffic cones laid out in a line. These cones are directing vehicles to shift into the left lane, indicating that the right lane is out of service for some reason.\n\nSupporting this redirection of traffic, there is a series of blue and white barriers arranged to blockade an area on the right side of the road as well. These barriers corroborate the need for vehicles to merge left, implying that there might be ongoing road work or a particular event causing the right lane to be inaccessible.\n\nLastly, the road surface is wet, which can be discerned by its shiny appearance. A slippery road surface like this could pose a risk by lessening tire grip and consequently extending the stopping distance necessary for vehicles, impacting the overall safety and maneuverability of the autonomous vehicle."
