The truck has its tail lights on and reflective markings that are clearly visible. It's occupying the same lane as the ego vehicle and seems to either be stationary or moving slowly. The presence of the truck necessitates that the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance and be ready to either stop or navigate around the truck if it doesn't start moving.\n\nAdditionally, there's a traffic light in view that is red. The red light signals that the ego vehicle is required to come to a complete stop. The vehicle must wait for the light to turn green before proceeding through the intersection. No other road users like vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are present in this scenario."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer truck, identifiable by its large rotating drum used for mixing cement. As part of the vehicle's safety design, it features bright red tail lights and reflective warning signs to ensure visibility to other road users during nighttime or low-light conditions. The presence of this truck in front of the ego car implies that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance. This is crucial as the mixer truck could stop abruptly or slow down for operational reasons, and the rotating drum suggests that construction work may be ongoing or that the truck is in transit to a construction site.",

It should maintain a safe distance from the truck in front, remaining alert for when the light turns green or if the truck starts to move. If the truck doesn't proceed when the light turns green, the ego car may need to safely change lanes if possible to continue. The ego car should use appropriate lighting and drive cautiously due to the night-time conditions."
