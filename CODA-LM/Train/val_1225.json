This vehicle's movements are critical for the ego car to consider in order to plan its trajectory and maintain a safe following distance.\n\nSecondly, a round blue sign with a white arrow pointing upwards is visible on the right side of the road, indicating that the road ahead is for one-way traffic. This sign confirms the ego car's correct travel direction and suggests that no oncoming traffic should be expected in this lane.\n\nAdditionally, a traffic light displaying multiple red lights is mounted on a post on the right side. The red lights signal the ego car to stop and wait for the lights to turn green before proceeding.\n\nLastly, red and white traffic cones are positioned in a line, forming a barrier on the right side of the road.
