The first vehicle is a silver sedan located in the left lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. This vehicle’s proximity to the ego car could influence its ability to safely change lanes or maintain its current speed. The second vehicle is a red sedan positioned ahead of the ego car in the right lane, also moving in the same direction. The red sedan's behavior and speed will affect the ego car’s driving decisions, especially if it slows down or changes lanes.
