They guide vehicles to avoid specific areas to ensure safety and smooth flow of traffic. In this scenario, the cone's presence might indicate that parts of the road ahead are closed or have hazards, suggesting that the ego car should continue with caution and possibly prepare to steer around or slow down when approaching this cone.",

This cone helps in alerting the driver of the ego car to potential hazards or changes in driving paths.
