In the vehicles category, there are two large construction vehicles, specifically cranes, positioned side by side and occupying the lanes ahead. These vehicles appear to be stationary, with their outriggers extended for stability during operation. The presence of these cranes obstructs both lanes, requiring the ego car to either stop or find an alternative path to avoid collision and adhere to safety protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the road scene includes barriers, identified as makeshift barricades and construction materials scattered around the road area, indicating an active construction site. These barriers imply that there may be construction work in progress, posing potential hazards. This situation calls for reduced speed and increased vigilance while navigating through the area."

This vehicle is large, equipped with a boom crane, and painted in vibrant yellow and white hues for high visibility on site. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction activity in the vicinity. Drivers, including the ego car, should exercise caution, possibly reducing speed and paying close attention to sudden stops or direction changes from the construction vehicle. Moreover, there might be additional traffic restrictions or detour signs around such vehicles to facilitate safe passage through the construction zone, which could influence the driving route or behavior.",
