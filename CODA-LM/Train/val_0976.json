The stationary position of the van might obstruct part of the lane, necessitating an adjustment in the ego vehicle's trajectory to maintain a safe distance if it intends to pass.\n\nAdditionally, pedestrians are visible in the distance, near the parked van on the right side of the road. The presence of pedestrians near the roadway poses a potential risk as they could enter the roadway, impacting the path of the ego vehicle. It is advised to approach this area with caution.\n\nFurthermore, traffic signs are present on the right side of the road. One of these signs indicates no parking or stopping, while another sign possibly denotes bus operations or lane usage ahead. These signs are crucial as they may indicate restrictions on road usage, which could influence the ego vehicle's driving decisions, such as lane choice.\n\nThere are no traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects mentioned in the data, suggesting that these elements do not play a role in the current traffic scenario being described."
