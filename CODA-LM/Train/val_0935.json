Firstly, there is a large yellow construction crane mounted on a truck occupying the right lane directly ahead. This crane is a significant presence on the road; it may move slowly or stop for operational reasons, which could obstruct the flow of traffic. As a result, other vehicles, including the ego car, will need to be prepared to navigate around it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a white sedan in the left lane, positioned slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. The sedan's presence is important as it shares the road with the ego car, and its speed and position will affect the ego car's decisions regarding lane choice and speed adjustments.\n\nLastly, there is a red traffic light visible above the white sedan. This red light is a critical signal that requires all traffic to stop. The ego car must obey this traffic light by not proceeding through the intersection or crossing the stop line until the light changes to green.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a rear tail light set of a bus, illuminated to indicate that the bus either is braking or has its lights on due to low light conditions. The configuration typically includes brake lights and tail lights, with red illumination to attract attention and ensure visibility. The activation of these lights suggests the bus is slowing down or coming to a stop. For the ego car, these signal lights prompt the driver to possibly reduce speed and be prepared to stop, maintaining a safe following distance.",

Such cranes are used for lifting heavy loads at construction sites.

The ego car driver must stay alert to unpredictable movements such as sudden stops by the crane truck or shifting of heavy loads that might extend into adjacent lanes.",
