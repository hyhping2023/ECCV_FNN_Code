        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image viewed, there is a notable presence of a vehicle and another object, specifically a large metal container. Firstly, the vehicle, which is situated on the side of the road ahead on the right, appears to be parked with its headlights off, suggesting it is stationary. This parked car is significant because it narrows the width of the available road space for driving. For safe passage, it is crucial to monitor the car closely as one drives by, ensuring it remains stationary without any sudden movements.\n\nAdditionally, on the left side of the road, there is a substantial obstruction identified as a large metal container, which could be a dumpster. This object, while currently not directly affecting the drivability of the road, presents an obstacle. It's vital to be aware of this container, especially if a situation arises that necessitates a sudden deviation from the planned path towards the right, offering less room for maneuver due to the parked car. \n\nBoth the parked car and the dumpster demand attentiveness and careful navigation, ensuring safe and uninterrupted driving."

This dustbin appears to be large and metallic, typically used for communal waste disposal. Its placement indicates it is for public use, likely serving the nearby residential building. For the ego car, awareness of this stationary object is necessary to avoid any collision, especially when maneuvering or reversing in dimly lit conditions as shown in the image. The presence of such an object in a parking or driving area requires careful navigation to maintain safety and prevent damage to the vehicle and the property.",

Use the vehicle's lights appropriately to increase visibility and alertness."
