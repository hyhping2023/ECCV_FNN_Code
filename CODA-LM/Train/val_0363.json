Additionally, a white car is sharing the same lane with the ego car, it is stationary due to traffic and is obstructing the ego car's path, necessitating a maneuver around it.\n\nA vulnerable road user is visible in the form of a cyclist wearing a red raincoat who is situated to the right of the ego car, preparing to cross in front of it. The cyclist's presence and potential to cross the lane demand the ego car's immediate attention for safe navigation.\n\nIn terms of traffic management, there are orange and white traffic cones set up in an arc to the right of the ego car, marking off a specific area and guiding the traffic flow away from it, meaning that the ego car must steer around this cordoned-off zone. Moreover, there are yellow barriers located further to the right, beyond the cyclist, that block off a section adjacent to the footpath; these barriers signify a closed area but don't directly interfere with the lane the ego car occupies.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, or other miscellaneous objects impacting the scene."
