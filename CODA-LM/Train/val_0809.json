        "description and explanation": "The traffic scene under observation includes a large yellow truck positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle. It is notable for occupying most of the lane and its brake lights are activated, indicating that it might be slowing down or has come to a stop. This situation necessitates that the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance and remains prepared to stop to avoid any potential accidents. Additionally, there is a cyclist observed on the right side of the road. The cyclist, who is wearing a green jacket, appears to be moving parallel to the vehicle flow. The presence of the cyclist requires vigilant monitoring by the ego vehicle as cyclists can often make unpredictable movements or shift their position on the road. The ego vehicle must, therefore, be ready to adapt its driving strategy if the cyclistâ€™s movements necessitate it. The scene is devoid of any traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects that could impact the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

Dressed in casual attire, the pedestrian appears in a motion pose, suggesting that they are currently walking.
