The presence of these motorcyclists necessitates caution and may require the ego car to adjust its speed to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, striped traffic cones are positioned at the edge of the left side of the road, signaling that part of the road or the adjacent area is inaccessible. The ego car must avoid this area to ensure it remains in the correct lane. Furthermore, there is a long green barrier along the left side of the road, likely indicating a construction zone or a restricted area. This barrier serves as a guide for the ego car to stay in its current lane, as the areas next to the barrier are not available for vehicular traffic. There are no other vehicles, traffic signs, traffic lights, or other objects reported in the scene."
