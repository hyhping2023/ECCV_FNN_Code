It has spokes and a central hub, resembling an oversize version of a bicycle wheel. Positioned on the side of the road and not on the driving path, this object doesn't immediately influence the driving behavior of the ego car in terms of maneuvering or immediate road safety. However, the presence of such industrial equipment near the roadway could suggest that there may be nearby industrial activity or constructions which might affect traffic flow or necessitate caution due to the potential movement of heavy vehicles or machinery in the area.",
