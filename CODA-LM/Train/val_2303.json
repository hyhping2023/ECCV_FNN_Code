This vehicle's size and position affect the visibility ahead and may require the ego car to maintain additional distance for safe braking. Additionally, there is a cyclist on the right side of the road, ahead of the ego car and moving in the same direction. The cyclist's proximity to the driving lane may impact the ego car's ability to maneuver around the construction vehicle safely. A green traffic light is also visible ahead, indicating that the ego car is permitted to proceed, although continued attention to road users and their movements is necessary."

This type of vehicle is utilized in the construction industry for mixing and transporting concrete to various sites. The presence of such a vehicle on the road signals potential nearby construction activity. For the ego car, this indicates that the driving behavior should include increased alertness and readiness to adapt to potential hazards like slow-moving traffic, sudden stops, or debris on the road from construction activities. Furthermore, due to the size of the construction vehicle, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for wider turns taken by the truck.",

Additionally, the ego car should be prepared to change lanes if necessary and safe to do so, taking into account the cyclist's position. Since the light is green, proceed with caution while continuously monitoring the road users' actions."
