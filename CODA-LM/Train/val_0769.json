This parked car narrows the usable width of the lane, so the ego car will have less space to maneuver and must adjust its position cautiously.\n   - On the right side of the road, a large commercial vehicle with a red cabin and a green cargo area is stationary, likely involved in construction work. The proximity of this vehicle to the traffic lane suggests possible pedestrian movement around it, and materials or workers may unexpectedly enter the roadway.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - A person in red attire is standing by the green commercial vehicle on the right, interacting with the vehicle. The pedestrian's presence, especially close to active road work, indicates potential for unexpected movements, prompting the ego vehicle to reduce speed and prepare to stop if necessary.\n\n3. **Traffic Cones**:\n   - Multiple traffic cones are placed around the construction site, segregating the area and partly intruding into the traffic lane. These cones indicate a construction zone requiring vehicles to slow down and potentially navigate around the obstruction.\n\n4. **Barriers**:\n   - Barrier poles are noticeable on the sidewalk close to the parked vehicles, indicating a delineated pedestrian area or construction zone. The barriers highlight areas where pedestrian activity may be redirected onto the road, underscoring the need for increased vigilance and reduced speed.\n\n5. **Other Objects**:\n   - There are various construction materials and debris scattered around the construction vehicle on the right side, suggesting active roadwork. Loose materials could pose hazards for the vehicle's traction, and unexpected obstacles might appear in the driving lane.\n\nThe presence of these elements indicates a complex environment requiring careful navigation, reduced speed, and heightened attention to potential hazards."
