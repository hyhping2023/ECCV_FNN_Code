        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, there are a few notable elements affecting vehicular movement. On the right side of the road, there is a crane truck parked with its boom extended, facing away from the ego vehicle. The positioning and the size of the crane truck are significant because they could represent a hazard, either by the truck moving suddenly or by the boom swinging. The presence of this crane truck indicates there might be construction work or the operation of heavy vehicles in the vicinity, demanding extra caution.\n\nAdditionally, there are several trucks parked on the left side of the road. All the trucks are facing away from the ego car. These parked trucks can reduce the visible area and the overall navigable width of the road, thus requiring the ego car to maneuver cautiously.\n\nIn the environment, there is construction or debris observed on the hillside behind a barrier. This suggests there might be recent or ongoing construction activities. Such environmental indications warn of a higher chance of encountering unexpected obstacles or vehicles that could enter the roadway. Due to this, it's necessary for the ego car to maintain increased vigilance while driving through this area.\n\nNo vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, or barriers are reported in the scene based on the provided data."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a large construction vehicle, specifically designed as mobile crane. Characterized by its extensive crane arm and supporting outriggers, it is used for lifting and moving heavy materials at construction sites. In the driving scenario, the presence of this vehicle might indicate ongoing construction work nearby, potentially leading to restricted traffic flow or temporary road closures. For the ego car, this requires heightened awareness and possible speed adjustments to navigate safely through or around the construction zone.",
