However, there is a traffic sign and a traffic cone which are influencing the driving scenario.\n\nThe traffic sign is a blue vertical sign located on the right side of the road, featuring white and yellow characters for informational or directional purposes. It displays text and an emblem which might provide location context and institutional information. Although this is a non-regulatory sign, it does not have a direct impact on the ego car's immediate driving decisions.\n\nAdditionally, a portable and retractable traffic barrier is spotted in the middle of the pedestrian crossing. It's in a half-opened state, signaling a temporary blockage or a maintenance operation. Because of this traffic cone, the ego car is required to avoid the pedestrian crossing, potentially waiting for the blockage to clear or finding an alternative route to continue driving safely."
