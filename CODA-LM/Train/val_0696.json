One is a red vehicle on the right edge of the image, moving in the same direction as the ego car, which must be monitored for any potential lane changes or sudden stops. The other group consists of several vehicles ahead on the same road with visible tail lights, suggesting that they are either moving away or stationary; hence the ego car should maintain a safe distance to allow for timely braking or maneuvering if necessary.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is an overhead gantry with road signs visible in the distance which are unclear in the image. These signs may contain essential information about road conditions, directions, or regulations that could influence driving behavior.\n\nThe traffic lights ahead show red, indicating that the ego car must stop at the upcoming intersection. Adhering to this signal is crucial for complying with traffic regulations and ensuring safety.\n\nOrange traffic cones are forming a barrier to the left side of the image, signaling a closed lane or detour. These cones denote a potential road hazard or construction zone, necessitating that the ego car stays within the available lanes.\n\nAdditionally, metal barriers are present on either side of the road, demarcating the allowed driving area and restricting access to adjacent areas. These barriers help ensure the vehicle remains on the correct path.\n\nLastly, there are street lights and trees to the left of the ego car. While these objects do not directly impact immediate driving behavior, they are part of the road environment. The trees could obscure road signs or signals if not properly trimmed and should therefore be considered."
