A white van is stationed on the right side of the road, facing the ego vehicle with its headlights on, potentially obstructing part of the roadway. This position and the bright headlights of the van may reduce visibility for the ego vehicle, requiring a cautious approach if passing is necessary. Additionally, multiple trucks are parked on the left side of the road, aligned in a queue with their rear lights visible. Although stationary, these trucks indicate a busy area where there could be unexpected pedestrian or vehicle movement around the parked trucks.\n\nRegarding vulnerable road users, a group of pedestrians is visible on the right, walking alongside the edge of the road. Their close proximity to the roadway necessitates that the ego vehicle decrease speed and be prepared to stop to ensure pedestrian safety. Moreover, several individuals on two-wheel vehicles, possibly electric bikes or scooters, are also on the right side of the vehicles. Their proximity to the driving lane requires the ego vehicle to exercise caution and be ready to adjust speed or path if any of these riders enter the driving lane.\n\nThere are no traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects visible in this traffic image."

The headlights of the van may cause temporary visibility issues, so passing, if necessary, should be done with utmost caution, ideally after ensuring there's no oncoming traffic and that the path is clear of pedestrians and riders. The ego vehicle should also be ready to stop quickly if any of the road users unexpectedly enter the driving path."
