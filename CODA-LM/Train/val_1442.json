This truck is in the same lane as the ego car. The presence of the truck dictates that the ego car should maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, the ego car should be ready to change lanes if needed, particularly if the truck decelerates or comes to a stop. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect driving behavior."

It appears to be a large, industrial vehicular unit equipped with an extendable arm and platform that workers use for tasks at height, commonly seen in road work or building maintenance. The presence of this vehicle on the road indicates ongoing construction or maintenance work, which may lead to potential obstructions ahead. As a result, the ego car should approach with caution, be prepared for sudden stops or detours, and obey any temporary traffic signs or instructions from road workers.",
