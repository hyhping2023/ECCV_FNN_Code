It appears to be either moving straight or turning left, based on its positioning and orientation relative to the intersection. This vehicle's movement and direction are crucial as they will determine when it is safe for the ego vehicle to proceed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a dark-colored SUV on the right side, heading in the same direction as the ego vehicle and occupying the lane adjacent to it. Monitoring the SUV's trajectory and speed is important for maintaining a safe distance and staying within the proper lane.\n\nOverhead directional signs provide clear instructions about the lane directions and the movements that are permitted, assisting drivers in navigating the intersection and choosing the correct lane for their destination.\n\nIn the distance, multiple traffic lights are visible and are currently green, signaling that vehicles are allowed to continue through the intersection. The status of these traffic lights is a determining factor for the timing of the ego vehicle's movement.\n\nLastly, there are lane divider markings accompanied by plastic poles between the lanes leading to the intersection. These installations serve as guidance to ensure that vehicles stay within their respective lanes."

Positioned at the edge of the road or on medians, bollards prevent vehicles from entering certain areas, enhancing safety for both pedestrians and drivers. In this scenario, the bollard serves to prevent vehicles from accidentally or deliberately entering the verge or pedestrian paths beside the roadway. The presence of this bollard directly influences the driving behavior as it limits the available space for maneuvering or turning, guiding the ego car to maintain its current lane and discouraging any attempts to circumvent typical traffic routes.",
