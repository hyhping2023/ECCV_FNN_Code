The presence of the sedan necessitates that the ego car adjusts its speed and maintains an adequate following distance for safety.\n\nTo the roadside and on the sidewalks, there are multiple pedestrians present, some of whom are preparing to cross the street at a crosswalk. The possibility of these pedestrians stepping onto the road necessitates the ego car to be ready to stop at any moment to ensure pedestrian safety.\n\nThe traffic scenario includes several signs: a 'no entry' sign is positioned to the right side of the road, indicating that the ego car cannot proceed in that lane, thus requiring the selection of an appropriate traveling lane. Additionally, there are blue circular signs that mandate the direction the ego car must take, guiding it along permissible routes.\n\nBy the crosswalk, a traffic light displaying a red signal can be seen. This red light dictates that the ego car must come to a complete stop at the intersection and can only proceed once the light turns green.\n\nOn the side of the road near the crosswalk, a configuration of orange traffic cones is observed, delineating a restricted area, likely due to roadwork or as a safety precaution. These cones signal that the ego car should act with caution and might need to adapt to changes in the lanes or reduced road width ahead.\n\nLastly, there is a group of bicycles parked on the side of the street next to the sidewalk on the right. The presence of these bicycles is significant as they may potentially interrupt the driving path, or they could become hindrances if moved onto the road by pedestrians or cyclists.\n\nThe road does not contain any barriers or additional objects that impact the driving conditions for the ego car according to the JSON categories where dictionaries are empty."
