        "description and explanation": "In the traffic scene, we have several elements that are influencing the behavior of the ego car. \n\nFirstly, there is a cyclist riding on the right side of the road, in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclist is dressed in dark clothing and is wearing a helmet. This calls for the ego car to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to either adjust its speed or change lanes to ensure it can safely overtake the cyclist.\n\nThere are also directional signs on an overhead gantry, making drivers aware of upcoming exits and lane designations. The ego car must read these signs to navigate the road correctly and make any necessary lane changes in advance.\n\nRed and white traffic cones have been placed on the right edge of the road, signaling the possibility of roadworks or hazards ahead. It's essential for the ego car to reduce its speed and be ready to merge left, while also watching out for any workers or equipment that might enter the road.\n\nMetal guardrails are installed along both sides of the road, which constrain any lateral movement by vehicles and necessitate that the ego car stays within the lane boundaries.\n\nFinally, there are bags of construction materials or debris situated near the cones on the right side of the road. These items could become obstructive or hazardous if they were to move onto the road, which means the ego car must remain vigilant.\n\nOverall, the autonomous driving system must navigate these various elements with caution, obeying road signs, and ready to adapt to the evolving road conditions to ensure safety."
