Both vehicles are in the right lane and moving in the same direction as the ego car. It is important for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance from these vehicles, as they may slow down or stop suddenly, necessitating a quick response from the ego car to avoid a collision.\n\nAdditionally, there are road signs on a pole on the left side of the road. These signs indicate that the road ahead goes straight and also impose certain restrictions: bicycles, mopeds, and pedestrians are not allowed, and there is a weight limit of 5 tons for vehicles. These signs are essential for the ego car to navigate correctly and to understand the types of traffic that are permitted on the road ahead."

            "description and explanation": "This image shows a construction vehicle, specifically what appears to be a flatbed truck with a mounted crane. The crane is typically used for lifting heavy materials at construction sites. The vehicle is substantial in size and may perform maneuvers such as slow turning or sudden stopping to manage or off-load construction materials at nearby sites. Understanding its presence is vital for the ego car's future driving behavior. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potential changes in the traffic flow due to this vehicle's operations or restrictions it might pose on normal traffic patterns.",

The driver should also remain aware of the traffic signs indicating the road is straight ahead and acknowledge the prohibitions for bicycles, mopeds, and pedestrians, and that there is a weight limit, suggesting the road may not support heavier vehicles. The driver should also be ready to navigate according to these posted signs and ensure compliance with all traffic rules."
