This vehicle is crucial for the ego vehicle to monitor, as any change in its speed or direction directly influences the ego vehicle's driving path. \n\nAdditionally, a pedestrian is noted on the right side of the road, standing by the roadside and facing away, indicating no immediate intention to cross. However, due to the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, it's essential for the ego vehicle to remain vigilant and prepared to react swiftly should the pedestrian decide to enter the road. \n\nFurthermore, a pedestrian crossing sign is observed on the right, serving as a crucial alert to the ego vehicle about a possible pedestrian crossing ahead. This sign indicates the necessity for heightened alertness for potential pedestrians entering the crosswalk, hence directly impacting the ego vehicle's speed and attention focus. \n\nLastly, a curb and greenery divider separating the opposing traffic lanes are present. This barrier plays a significant role in guiding the ego vehicle's path, ensuring it stays within its designated lane and preventing inadvertent entry into opposing traffic lanes. \n\nThe traffic scene lacks the presence of traffic lights, traffic cones, and other miscellaneous objects, indicating that they do not have an immediate influence on the current driving conditions."
