Firstly, there is a blue three-wheeled vehicle, likely a small motorized cart, situated directly in the ego vehicle's path in the middle of the road and carrying visible cargo. This vehicle may pose an obstacle as it could be moving slowly or even be stationary.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple stationary cars parked on both sides of the street. Some of these vehicles are covered in snow, indicating possible weather-related visibility and traction issues. The parked cars create a narrower drivable space, requiring the ego vehicle to navigate through cautiously.\n\nMoreover, a red-colored digital clock display is visible on the upper right side of the image, but no actual traffic lights are present. This display does not affect traffic flow but signifies the absence of traffic light control in the current frame.\n\nThere are no observations related to vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects in this traffic image."

            "description and explanation": "This object is a three-wheeled vehicle, commonly referred to as a tricycle. It appears to be motorized, given its size and apparent load capacity, indicated by the visible cargo area. This type of vehicle is often used for small-scale deliveries or personal transport, particularly in urban or densely populated areas. Its presence indicates a need for caution by the ego car driver due to the tricycles smaller, sometimes less stable design compared to standard four-wheeled vehicles. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for potentially slower speeds and sudden stops from the tricycle.",

It should also maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead to account for the reduced traction. Overtaking should be done with caution due to the narrow space from the parked cars and after ensuring the cart is stationary or safe to pass. Indicators should be used to alert other road users of the intention to overtake. Overall, it is essential to proceed with heightened caution due to the low visibility and adverse road conditions."
