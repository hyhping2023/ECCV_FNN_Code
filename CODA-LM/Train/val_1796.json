        "description and explanation": "In the scene, there is a large construction vehicle, specifically a cement mixer, positioned on the right side of the ego car. It is partially occupying the roadway and appears to be stationary. The presence of this vehicle is significant, as it reduces the available lane width and could become an obstruction if it were to move unexpectedly. Additionally, further ahead on the same side, there is a white van and a red car parked on the road's edge. While these vehicles are not posing an immediate hazard, attention should be paid to them in case their doors open or they enter the flow of traffic.\n\nThe image also includes a traffic sign, the specifics of which are difficult to make out due to the resolution and nighttime conditions. It is located on the right and possibly conveys parking regulations or limitations. It is imperative for the ego car to understand this sign as it may contain critical information about parking or stopping restrictions, influencing the driving and stopping options for the car.\n\nNo other road users, such as vulnerable road users, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects, are present in the traffic image."

Maintain a safe distance from parked vehicles and be prepared for potential movement of these vehicles. Pay attention to any signs which might become clearer as you approach and adjust driving behavior accordingly. Reduce speed and increase following distance because of the nighttime conditions and potential wet road surface to account for decreased visibility and potential reduction in traction."
