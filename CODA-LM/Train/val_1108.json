This truck may obscure visibility ahead and constrain the maneuvering space for the ego car.\n   - Multiple cars are ahead in adjacent lanes, with brake lights visible, indicating slowing or stopped traffic. This suggests there could be congestion, requiring the ego car to proceed with caution and prepare for potential stops.\n\n2. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - A green traffic light is visible over the mixer truck in the distance. This signals that traffic is allowed to move forward, but the reaction of the ego car may be delayed due to the vehicles in front.\n\n3. **Barriers**:\n   - Yellow barriers are present on the right-hand side of the road, indicating a construction area or lane closure. These barriers limit the available lanes for traffic and may necessitate a lane change if the current lane is ending or obstructed."

This vehicle is characterized by its robust size and rear chute possibly for concrete delivery. For the ego car in this scenario, the presence of such a large vehicle potentially restricts visibility and maneuverability. The driver of the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for unexpected stops or slow movement due to the operation of the construction vehicle.",

Be prepared to slow down or stop, as indicated by the brake lights of the vehicles ahead. Stay attentive to any lane changes that may be required due to the yellow barriers indicating a possible lane closure or construction area. Proceed with caution through the intersection, keeping in mind that the mixer truck can delay the reaction to the traffic light's state change. No lane change is suggested at this moment unless indicated by road signs or a change in traffic patterns."
