This sets the legal speed limit for the ego car when it resumes motion.\n\nFurthermore, the traffic light visible above the construction vehicle is showing red for the lane the ego car is in, with a countdown timer displaying the number 1. This indicates that the ego car must remain stationary as the light is red, and it will soon change, likely to green, given the countdown.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego car."

For the ego car, this vehicle poses a requirement for increased caution while driving behind or near it. Construction vehicles often make sudden stops and may have concrete or debris spilling, which can be hazardous. Therefore, maintaining a safe following distance and being prepared for unexpected movements is essential to prevent accidents.",

As the countdown is at 1, it suggests the light will soon change, likely green, at which point, if the construction vehicle does not move, the ego car should prepare to perform a lane change to the left if it's safe to do so to continue. Before changing lanes, the driver should make use of rear-view and side mirrors, as well as a check over the shoulder (blind spot check) to ensure no vehicles are in the left lane, and signal the intent to change lanes in a timely manner."
