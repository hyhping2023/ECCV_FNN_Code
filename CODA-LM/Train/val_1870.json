The presence of this truck may necessitate the ego car to slow down or change lanes as the truck could slow down to navigate through the work area. Additionally, several vehicles are visible in the distance ahead on the road, also moving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles will dictate the flow of traffic that the ego car will need to follow, and the ego car should be attentive to their movements, including any potential lane changes, stops, or slowdowns.\n\nA road sign is present on the right side of the road; however, the details on it are not clearly visible. As the ego car gets closer, it should attempt to read the sign, which may contain important information about road conditions, speed limits, or directions.\n\nThe traffic lights in the distance appear to be green at the moment, which suggests that the ego car can continue moving forward. Nevertheless, the ego car should remain alert and be prepared to stop or slow down if the lights change to yellow or red as it nears the intersection.\n\nLastly, there are curbside waste collection bins on the right of the road. These bins are not expected to interfere with the ego car's path unless there is a waste collection vehicle ahead that may be stopping to collect the waste."
