One is a white sedan that is either merging or turning right in front of the ego car, partially obstructing the lane that the ego car might use. This requires the ego car to either slow down or switch lanes to maintain a safe distance and avoid a collision. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles visible ahead of the ego car, all with their rear lights illuminated, indicating traffic presence. The density and behavior of these vehicles will influence the ego car's speed and lane choices. There are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects noted in the image."

Due to the presence of other vehicles in the vicinity and potentially wet road conditions, the ego car should proceed with caution, reduce speed if necessary, and increase the following distance to account for a potentially longer stopping distance. Keep the headlights on and ensure the visibility is clear, especially in the presence of reflective surfaces on the road that can affect visibility."
