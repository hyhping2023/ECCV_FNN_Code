        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, there is a yellow construction loader located slightly off-center at the intersection, facing the ego vehicle. It is in the oncoming lane and appears to be either stationary or moving slowly. The presence of this loader may obstruct the ego vehicle's path or create a hazard, necessitating the ego vehicle to slow down or stop until it is safe to continue.\n\nAdditionally, there are various parked vehicles on the right side of the road, including a white van and others that are only partially visible. These vehicles are not in motion, but they do reduce the width of the driving lane. As a result, the ego vehicle must remain vigilant for any unexpected actions from these parked vehicles, such as doors opening or the vehicles entering the flow of traffic.\n\nA traffic light near the construction loader is showing a green light for the lane where the loader is located. Although the green light typically indicates that it is safe to proceed, the construction vehicle's presence means that drivers should still approach with caution and be prepared to stop if the loader is blocking the lane.\n\nLastly, there is an object on the ground in front of the construction loader that looks like a speed bump or traffic calming device, but it is not secured to the pavement. This object could be a driving hazard since it is not properly installed. The ego vehicle will need to either maneuver around it or reduce speed significantly to safely cross over it."

Its primary function is to move or load large amounts of earth, sand, rocks, and other materials during construction activities. The presence of this construction vehicle indicates ongoing construction work in the area, which may lead to possible obstructions or diversions in the road.
