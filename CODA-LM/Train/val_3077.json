This likely suggests the SUV is reacting to the construction ahead or other unseen road users, requiring the ego car to stay cautious.\n\nA construction worker is visible on the right side of the road, wearing bright clothing for visibility. This worker indicates possible road work, and the ego car should slow down and be prepared to either stop or navigate around the construction zone.\n\nThere are also warning signs on the right side of the road, likely indicating ongoing construction or road work ahead. These signs advise the ego car to reduce speed and proceed carefully, being alert to any changes in traffic patterns due to the construction. \n\nTemporary fencing is observed along the right side of the road, marking the boundary of the construction area. This fencing acts as a guide for the ego car to maintain a safe distance from the construction activity.\n\nAdditionally, several green dustbins are aligned on the right side behind the barrier. While these do not directly impact the driving path, they underscore the need for caution in case workers are nearby or moving the bins. \n\nOverall, the image highlights the presence of a construction zone, necessitating careful and attentive driving from the ego car."
