The truck's brake lights are on, indicating it is either slowing down or coming to a stop. This suggests that the ego vehicle should also slow down or be prepared to stop to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, there are bright lights in the image that resemble oncoming headlights or large illuminated signs, but there is no clear visibility or definite traffic light present. Hence, these lights cannot be used as factors for making driving decisions."

The red hue indicates it is illuminated, which typically signifies that the vehicle is operational or in a braking mode. The presence of this light, prominently visible at night, alerts the ego car and other road users of the mixer's presence and current activity, suggesting caution and a potentially reduced speed to maintain safe driving conditions.",

Remain alert for potential traffic lights or signs that may not be visible due to the weather conditions and the glare from lights in the opposite lane. If visibility continues to decrease, consider using lower beam headlights to reduce glare and increase the visibility of the ego vehicle to others."
