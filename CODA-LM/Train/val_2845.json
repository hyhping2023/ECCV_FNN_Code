Additionally, there are orange and white traffic cones set up in a sequence, signaling that there is construction or road work ahead. These cones serve to guide vehicles and point out that a portion of the road or lane might be closed for works, urging drivers to proceed with caution to steer clear of the work area. Other categories such as vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic lights, barriers, and other objects are not present in the image."

Traffic cones are often used in construction zones, accident sites, or during roadway maintenance to guide drivers away from potential hazards and safely direct the flow of traffic. For the ego car in this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone necessitates careful navigation and possibly slowing down, especially since the cone may indicate temporary changes to normal driving patterns or an obstacle ahead.",

Its purpose is to signal to drivers that caution should be exercised when passing nearby, often indicating an area of road work, a hazard, or a change in traffic lanes. For the ego car, this implies the necessity to possibly slow down, maneuver carefully around the cone, and be alert to varying road conditions or directives.",
