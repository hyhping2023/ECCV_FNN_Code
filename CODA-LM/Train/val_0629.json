However, there is a single vulnerable road user, which is an individual standing on the sidewalk near a parked three-wheeled vehicle. This person may be in the process of either loading or unloading goods. Although the individual does not present an immediate hazard, the ego car needs to remain observant in case the person unexpectedly steps onto the road.\n\nAs for traffic signs, there are three key signs to note. Firstly, there's a \"No stopping or parking\" sign on the left side of the road, signifying that the ego car must not halt in this area and should be watchful of other road users respecting this rule. The presence of a \"30 km/h speed limit\" sign requires the ego car to adjust its speed to comply with the limit. Furthermore, a triangular warning sign indicates the possible presence of pedestrians nearby, which means the ego car should drive cautiously and be ready to stop or yield if necessary.\n\nLastly, there is a barrier with a blue and white \"No entry\" sign, which prohibits vehicle access to that area. The ego car needs to avoid this region and alter its course accordingly."
