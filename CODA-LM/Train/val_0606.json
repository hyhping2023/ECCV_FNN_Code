        "description and explanation": "In the observed traffic scene, the following road user details and their influences on autonomous driving behavior are noted:\n\nFirstly, a silver car is positioned on the left side of the ego car, both facing the same direction. The proximity of this car to the ego vehicle could impact which lane is chosen and requires careful observation to anticipate any potential maneuvers from the silver car.\n\nAdditionally, multiple vehicles are parked on the right side of the street. These parked vehicles pose a risk, as opening doors or pedestrians emerging suddenly could create hazards for the ego car.\n\nAhead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, there is traffic movement, with all vehicles traveling in the same direction. This traffic will determine the speed and the distance the ego car should maintain from the vehicle in front.\n\nMoreover, there is a cyclist ahead on the road, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car. The presence of the cyclist calls for an increased following distance and caution, especially when overtaking, to ensure the cyclist's safety.\n\nOn the left sidewalk, there's a pedestrian whose immediate actions are less likely to impact the ego car's behavior; however, their movements should be closely monitored in case they attempt to cross the street.\n\nIn terms of traffic signs, there is a blue parking sign on the left, which, while not directly influencing the driving behavior, does signal an area where vehicles might be entering or exiting parking, and therefore the potential for increased activity around parked vehicles.\n\nThe traffic lights that are in view display a green signal, allowing the ego car to proceed but signalling the need for attentiveness to any upcoming changes in the light status.\n\nThe setup of traffic cones and barriers along the road's centerline serves to direct flow and narrow the lanes, meaning that the ego vehicle must navigate the passage carefully to maintain safety.\n\nLastly, white and blue striped barriers are placed along the right side of the road, indicating a temporary sidewalk or a construction zone. Such barriers alert the ego vehicle to possible limitations in road width and the surrounding activity of construction workers or pedestrians.\n\nThe scene contains no other notable objects that could affect the driving behavior."
