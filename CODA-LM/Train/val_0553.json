The sedan's position and motion inform the ego car's following distance and potential maneuvers.\n   - A blue bus is stopped on the right side of the road ahead, partially visible with the front facing the ego car. The presence of a stopped bus may indicate passengers boarding or alighting, which can affect traffic flow and may require the ego car to slow down or change lanes to maintain safety.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Road Users**:\n   - Multiple pedestrians are crossing the street in front of the ego car on a zebra crossing. Pedestrians have right of way on the zebra crossing, requiring the ego car to stop until the crosswalk is clear.\n\n3. **Traffic Signs**:\n   - There's a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road, next to the traffic light, reinforcing the presence of the zebra crossing. This sign alerts drivers to potential pedestrian traffic and the need to yield.\n\n4. **Traffic Lights**:\n   - The traffic light is not clearly visible but we can assume it's red or turning red due to pedestrians crossing.
