Firstly, there is an oncoming vehicle noticed on the opposite lane, recognizable by its headlights being on. This condition necessitates that the autonomous car adjusts its headlights accordingly to a dim setting to prevent dazzling the driver of the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, a traffic light displaying a green signal is visible on the right side of the road in the distance. This green light signifies that the autonomous vehicle has the right to continue moving through the intersection or past this traffic signal as per traffic regulations. Furthermore, the presence of rows of barriers or barricades across the width of the road is observed, with a designated opening for vehicles to pass on the right side. These barriers serve the purpose of directing the flow of traffic, indicating that the vehicle should navigate through the available opening on the right to proceed further. The image lacks any vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, and any other objects that might affect driving behavior, making these aspects not applicable to the current driving scenario."
