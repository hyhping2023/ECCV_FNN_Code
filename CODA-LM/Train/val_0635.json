The MPV's stopped position and intention to turn could affect the ego vehicle's path and timing choices. Additionally, there is a white SUV on the right, positioned in the opposite lane and facing the ego vehicle, indicating oncoming traffic and potentially affecting the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver.\n\nThe scene also includes vulnerable road users. A cyclist is moving ahead parallel to the ego vehicle on the right, which may influence the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance and adjust its speed. Pedestrians are crossing the road at the intersection in front of the MPV, and they have the right of way. This requires the ego vehicle to stop or yield until the crosswalk is clear. There is also a motorcyclist in the foreground, oriented in the same direction as the ego vehicle, necessitating cautious speed regulation and potential changes in lane positioning.\n\nRegarding traffic signs, there is a no parking sign directly ahead on the right side of the road, beside the white SUV, informing the ego vehicle that parking is not allowed in the immediate vicinity. This impacts potential stopping decisions. Additionally, there is a blue circular sign with a white arrow pointing upward and left, located above the traffic light on the left side, which directs the ego vehicle towards permissible lane directions at the intersection.\n\nThe traffic light on the upper left is displaying green for the direction where the pedestrians are crossing. This indicates that the ego vehicle must wait for pedestrians to cross safely before proceeding if it intends to turn left or go straight, depending on its lane.\n\nThere are no traffic cones, barriers, or other objects present in the image that affect the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."

It is prominently displayed near the roadway and features a blue circle with a red border and a red slash through a 'P', which symbolizes parking.

Since the traffic light is green for pedestrians, the vehicle must yield to the pedestrians and wait for the crosswalk to clear before proceeding. It should maintain a safe following distance from the cyclist ahead and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary, while also monitoring the motorcyclist. The oncoming SUV should be monitored but does not currently pose a risk. Lastly, the ego vehicle must stay alert for the intentions of the dark-colored MPV, which is waiting to turn right."
