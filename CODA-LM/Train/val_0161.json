This vehicle's intention to turn left presents a potential affect the potential path of the ego car, particularly so if the ego vehicle intends to also make a turn or move straight through the crossroads. Additionally, several vehicles can be seen across the intersection in the background, queuing at a traffic stop indicating a possibility that the ego car has the right of way for now but also signaling the need for alertness to the changing traffic lights which could require a halt.\n\nAs regards to the vulnerable road users, a cyclist adorned in an orange jacket is noted to be crossing the intersection from left to right ahead of the ego vehicle, necessitating that the ego vehicle yield until the cyclist has completely crossed. On the sidewalk to the right side, pedestrians are spotted; although they are not crossing or affecting the immediate traffic flow, their movements should be tracked in case they step onto the crosswalk.\n\nThe traffic scene features a traffic light positioned in the upper center of the image showing green. This green light grants the vehicles moving in the same direction as the ego car, including the ego car itself, the go-ahead to proceed or make turns, with consideration to the actions of the other road users.\n\nLastly, on the right side of the image, traffic cones are noticed at the edge of the pedestrian crossing area, signifying possible construction work or a temporary blockage. These cones don't obstruct the vehicle pathway directly, but they are a sign that there might be construction activities in the area, necessitating a cautious approach.\n\nThis concludes the summary of the road users and their context in the traffic image provided."
