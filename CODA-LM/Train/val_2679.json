            "description and explanation": "This is a construction vehicle, specifically a forklift, identified by its distinctive features like the small, open cabin and the two extended metal forks used for lifting and carrying materials. The presence of this vehicle in a driving scenario usually indicates ongoing construction or work in the vicinity. It can impact driving behavior by necessitating reduced speed and increased caution due to potential hazards from construction activities and the possibility of sudden movements by the vehicle itself or other associated machinery and workers.",

As it approaches the traffic lights, it should adjust its speed according to the signal. Overall, heightened caution and defensive driving are advised in this urban construction zone."
