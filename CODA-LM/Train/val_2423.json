The presence of the sedan requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, multiple construction vehicles are observed lined up on both sides of the road. Some of these vehicles are stationary, while others may be active, indicating potential construction activity ahead. The proximity and nature of these vehicles suggest the possibility of workers being nearby and the risk of sudden movements or obstructions entering the car's path.\n\nAlthough not directly visible, the typical protocol around construction sites implies that there might be traffic cones or other warning devices present in the area. These would signal changes in the traffic pattern or lane closures, necessitating caution and the potential need for the ego car to merge into another lane.\n\nFurthermore, a makeshift barrier is located on the left side between the construction vehicles, signifying a construction site. This barrier could reduce the available road space for driving and may present a hazard if any unexpected movement occurs towards the vehicle's path."
