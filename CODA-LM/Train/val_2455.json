The presence of this large vehicle suggests tight road space, necessitating careful maneuvering.\n2. A black SUV is directly ahead of the ego vehicle with its rear hatch open and a person inside, indicating it is parked. This stationary SUV is obstructing the lane, requiring the ego vehicle to either change lanes or stop.\n\nThere is one vulnerable road user:\n1. A pedestrian wearing dark clothing and carrying a red bag is walking along the edge of the road on the right, facing away from the ego vehicle. Pedestrians close to the driving lane can be unpredictable and might enter the roadway, necessitating slower speeds and readiness to stop.\n\nFor traffic lights, the information is incomplete:\n1. The traffic light is not visible in the image. Without this information, the ego vehicle must exercise caution at intersections or signal-controlled areas.\n\nAdditionally, other objects in the image include:\n1.
