The first is a green and gray truck that is on the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car. It is partially obstructing the ego car's lane, which affects the ego car's ability to maintain its current speed and lane position, while also reducing visibility ahead on the road. The second vehicle is a red semi-truck with a cargo container that is parked on the left shoulder and facing the opposite direction. Although the red semi-truck isn't directly in the path of the ego car, it requires caution from the driver as it presents potential risks, including the possibility of the truck's doors opening or the truck merging back into the flow of traffic.\n\nThere are no vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects reported in the traffic image."

The vehicles presence indicates active or upcoming construction work in the vicinity. For the ego car, this means there might be potential slowdowns, detours, or partial lane closures ahead. The driver should stay alert for changing traffic patterns, possibly reduced speed limits, and other construction-related signs to safely navigate past this area.",

Regular monitoring of the surrounding environment for any unexpected changes is recommended."
