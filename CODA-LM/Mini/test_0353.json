Extra caution is advised because motorcyclists can quickly alter speed and lane position and are more difficult to spot due to their smaller size. Additionally, overhead directional signs on the right side of the road provide valuable information about forthcoming routes and how lanes can be used, which is important for navigational decisions. Lastly, there is a continuous green construction barrier on the right side of the road, indicating the presence of roadwork or construction. This barrier may lead to lane narrowing or unexpected obstacles, necessitating attentive driving and possible adjustments to the vehicle's path."

Its purpose is to warn drivers of potential hazards or to redirect traffic flow. In this scenario, the presence of the traffic cone could indicate road work ahead, an accident, or a closed lane. The ego car should be prepared to slow down, proceed with caution, or potentially change lanes if the adjacent lane is clear and it's safe to do so.",
