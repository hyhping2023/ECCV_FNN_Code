The mixer truck's size and weight could affect its maneuverability and stopping distance, posing a potential hazard if the ego vehicle needs to change lanes or if the truck changes lanes unexpectedly."

The presence of such a heavy vehicle suggests a construction site may be nearby.

Continuously monitor the cement mixer truck's position and be prepared for possible merging vehicles avoiding the parked trailer. Obey traffic signals and conditions, and adjust speed to accommodate for any changes in road surface quality. Ensure to monitor the rear-view and side mirrors for any vehicles that might enter your lane, especially given the partially obstructed left lane. The ego car should also scan the environment continuously for any additional road users or signs not visible in the current image. Maintain a safe following distance behind the vehicles ahead, monitor the traffic light for potential changes, and remain attentive to the mixer truck in the adjacent lane as it may present blind spots or require additional space to maneuver. Do not attempt to overtake unless the lane is clearly visible and safe to do so, and be prepared to adapt speed according to the flow of traffic and the traffic light signals."
