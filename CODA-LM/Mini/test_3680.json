There are three vehicles in view: firstly, a white car is parked on the right side of the road, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle's position, which could impact the ego vehicle's path planning, particularly for any intended right turns or narrower road passages. Secondly, a dark-colored car is ahead in the right lane, requiring the ego vehicle to adjust its speed and maintain a safe following distance. Thirdly, a white van further down the road, facing the ego vehicle, calls for heightened attention as it might begin moving or pedestrians could step out from behind it.\n\nOne pedestrian is standing on the sidewalk by the motorcycles, and while not immediately on the road, they might enter the roadway prompting the ego vehicle to carefully monitor their movement.\n\nAdditionally, there are motorcycles parked on the sidewalk which could impact driving behavior if they were to be moved onto the road. Lastly, a light pole is illuminating the scene, significantly improving visibility for the ego vehicle, aiding in the detection of potential road users and obstacles.\n\nOther categories including traffic signs, traffic lights, traffic cones, and barriers are not present in the image and therefore have no bearing on the driving situation."

Also be cautious around the parked cars as they may limit maneuverability or obscure pedestrians and other hazards from view. Since it is night, ensure that headlights are on and adjust driving to the reduced visibility conditions. Proceed with caution, maintaining a safe distance from the parked vehicles and scooters. Be prepared to stop or slow down if the pedestrian shows any indication of crossing the road. Keep to the left side of the lane to allow for more reaction space and visibility around the parked vehicles, and continuously monitor for any signs of movement or other road users entering the roadway."
