The truck's safety lights and reflective markings are turned on. Due to the size and position of the truck, it limits the visibility and maneuverability for the ego vehicle, necessitating a safe following distance and alertness for any sudden stops or changes in speed. Additionally, there is a traffic light ahead, visible above the truck, which is currently green. This indicates that traffic is allowed to move forward, and the ego vehicle can continue to follow the truck through the intersection, as long as the path remains clear and no other road hazards arise. No other vehicles, vulnerable road users, traffic signs, traffic cones, barriers, or other objects are described in the data for this traffic image."

The size and nature of this vehicle means that it may operate or make maneuvers at slower speeds, particularly when entering or exiting a construction site. The ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or turns by this large vehicle.",

Continue to proceed as the traffic light is green, so it is safe to follow the truck through the intersection or along the road, provided all other traffic conditions are normal and safe. Additionally, monitor the surroundings for any changes in the traffic pattern that might require a lane change or other maneuvering."
