These trucks are large, slow-moving, and could potentially slow down or stop to perform their duties, requiring the ego vehicle to change lanes to maintain its speed.\n\nAdditionally, there is a bus ahead in the same lane as the ego vehicle, also moving in the same direction. This bus may make frequent stops to pick up or drop off passengers, which could affect the flow of traffic and the ego vehicle's progression.\n\nIn the category of traffic lights, there is no visible traffic light in the image provided. This absence means the ego car's decisions must rely on other cues from the road, traffic laws, and the behavior of other road users.\n\nLastly, in the category of other objects, another bus is seen ahead in the lane to the left. This bus could also stop to pick up or drop off passengers, requiring the ego car to anticipate stopping or slowing traffic ahead."

Additionally, consider using the left lane to overtake if the trucks are moving slower than the traffic flow and it is safe to do so. Stay aware of other vehicles that might also be trying to navigate around these slower-moving vehicles. Stay alert for any changes in the road environment or the behavior of other road users, including any traffic signs or signals that may come into view further down the road."
