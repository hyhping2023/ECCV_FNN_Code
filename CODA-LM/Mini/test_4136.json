There is a large truck with a mixer moving ahead of the ego car in the same lane, which is partially loaded and carries a risk of material spillage due to its open nature. The ego car must be cautious of potential falling debris and maintain a safe following distance to respond to any unpredictable movements or spillage from the truck. Additionally, a white van is present in the lane adjacent to the left of the cement mixer truck, traveling in the same direction. The ego car needs to stay aware of this van to keep a safe distance.\n\nOn the right side of the truck, a cyclist is present in close proximity to the travel lane, heading in the same direction as traffic. The ego car must be ready to potentially slow down or change lanes to ensure safety if the cyclist shifts into the main travel lane or if the truck's actions impact the cyclist's safety.\n\nAs for the road signs, there is a yellow diamond-shaped sign indicating a crossing, hinting at the possibility of other road users crossing the road, while a circular speed limit sign enforces a limit of 20 km/h. These signs demand that the ego car adjusts its speed as per the speed limit and remains vigilant for potential crossing road users.\n\nLastly, there are guardrails along the side of the road, marking the boundary and separating the roadway from the adjoining area. The ego car must remain within its lane and keep a safe distance from these barriers to prevent accidents when overtaking or if there is a need for sudden evasive actions.\n\nNo traffic lights, traffic cones, or other objects are present in this traffic image as indicated by the empty categories in the provided data."

It should also monitor the cyclist's position and be prepared to either slow down or cautiously change lanes if necessary, ensuring it does not endanger the cyclist or other road users. Additionally, the speed limit of 20 km/h must be adhered to, particularly since there may be a crossing ahead where pedestrians could appear. The ego car should also adjust its speed in consideration of the wet road conditions to prevent skidding or hydroplaning. Be attentive to any crossing traffic or road users that may require it to yield or stop."
