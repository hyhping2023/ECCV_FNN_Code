        "description and explanation": "In the traffic image, the right lane directly in front of the ego vehicle is occupied by a large, industrial truck with a crane arm extended upwards. This truck appears to be stationary as indicated by its illuminated braking lights. The size and position of the truck obstruct the forward path of the ego car and reduce visibility ahead, making it necessary to change the driving path. Additionally, a black sedan is visible on the left lane, traveling slightly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same direction. This sedan's presence is important for considering any potential lane change maneuvers the ego car may need to execute to avoid the stationary truck.\n\nA traffic light is visible ahead on the right side, showing a green light for the direction the ego car is traveling. While the green light permits vehicles to proceed, the stationary truck may require vehicles to maneuver around it despite the green signal.\n\nAlong the right edge of the road, there are traffic cones lined up, indicating that a section of the road may be closed off or require caution. The presence of the cones suggests potential hazards or construction ahead, necessitating reduced speed and increased attentiveness."

Its size and extended equipment suggest it is used for heavy lifting and construction-related tasks. The presence of this vehicle indicates a possible work zone ahead, which may lead the ego car to reduce speed, exercise caution, and possibly follow detour or work zone traffic signs. Due to its size, the crane truck can also obstruct the view of the road and its users, requiring increased situational awareness from the driver of the ego car.",

The action should be executed with careful attention to the black sedan in the adjacent lane, and considering the right-of-way as indicated by the green traffic light. Proper signaling and a controlled change of speed are recommended to safely navigate around the obstruction."
