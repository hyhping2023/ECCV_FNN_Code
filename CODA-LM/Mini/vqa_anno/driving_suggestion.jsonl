You must not discuss any objects beyond the seven categories above. Please provide driving suggestions for the ego car based on the current scene.", "answer": "The ego car should prepare to slow down and stop if the traffic lights are currently red and monitor them for changes to green. It should keep a safe following distance from the flatbed truck due to its potential slower speed and maintain awareness of the white SUV's movements for any lane changes or turns. The driver should be prepared to adjust the vehicle's position and speed accordingly. Maintain a safe following distance from the white SUV on the right and monitor the large crane truck on the left for any potential movement into the ego car's lane. Approach the intersection with caution, obeying the traffic light signals, and be prepared to stop if the lights are red. Stay in the current lane unless the situation necessitates a lane change while ensuring it is safe to do so. Continue to scan the environment for any updates, such as the activation of turn signals by the crane truck or any other road users' sudden movements. Given the current scene, the ego car should continue to proceed in its lane while keeping a safe distance from the large vehicle on the left.
