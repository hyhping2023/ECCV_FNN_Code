This darkened state increases the risk of collision as it may not be immediately visible to the ego car or other road users. Additionally, there's another parked or possibly abandoned three-wheeler on the same side of the road without a distinct color due to low visibility conditions. This vehicle, lacking any visible occupant and facing the same direction as the ego vehicle, poses a hazard if someone attempts to enter or move it. It also reduces the usable width of the road, increasing the risk, especially if there is oncoming traffic. Moreover, there is one traffic light visible ahead, displaying a green light, which indicates that the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed through the intersection or along its path."

Considering its position, it appears to be stationary or moving slowly at the edge of the driving lane. When approaching this tricycle, the ego car should reduce speed and be prepared to maneuver safely around it, ensuring sufficient space is maintained to avoid any potential contact, especially since the visibility may be low due to the nighttime conditions. The driver should also be alert for any sudden movements from the tricycle that may require evasive action.",
